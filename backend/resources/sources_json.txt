            "text": " The Guyana government has abandoned plans to develop the 165-MW Amaila Falls hydroelectric plant, citing numerous delays and potential cost overruns.  The project was to have been Guyana\u2019s first major hydropower plant and would have been located about 250 kilometers southwest of the capital city on the Kuribrong River. Preliminary estimates reported in 2008 put the price of the plant between US$400 million and $500 million, with financing to have been provided by sources including the Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank and New York-based Sithe Global. Sithe, which signed an agreement with the China Railway First Group (CRFG) in September 2012 to help co-finance Amaila Falls, had already invested at least $16 million in preparatory work before fully withdrawing its support for the project in August 2013. The Guyanese government will now begin planning feasibility studies for a new large hydropower project in the country\u2019s northwestern region, according to Finance Minister Winston Jordan, who also said smaller regionalized plants will also likely be a consideration.

            "text": " Publicidad    La central hidroel\u00e9ctrica Delsitanisagua finalmente fue inaugurada, despu\u00e9s de resolver problemas t\u00e9cnicos y legales que obligaron a que la construcci\u00f3n se retrase por m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os. El evento oficial se realiz\u00f3 ayer con la presencia de Carlos P\u00e9rez, ministro de Energ\u00eda y Recursos Naturales No Renovables; Gonzalo Uquillas, gerente de la Corporaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador (Celec); y otros representantes del Gobierno. Delsitanisagua est\u00e1 ubicada en la provincia de Zamora Chinchipe. Cuenta con una capacidad instalada de 180 megavatios (MW), con una producci\u00f3n anual estimada de 1.411 gigavatios/hora (GWh).  Los principales beneficiarios son alrededor de 560.000 habitantes de las provincias del sur del pa\u00eds.  Su construcci\u00f3n se inici\u00f3 en 2011 y para 2016 deb\u00eda estar en pleno funcionamiento. Adem\u00e1s el contrato principal con la constructora Hydrochina pas\u00f3 de $ 195 millones a $ 258 millones, debido a que se detectaron problemas geot\u00e9cnicos con la ubicaci\u00f3n original, por lo que el proyecto tuvo que ser redise\u00f1ado y reubicado. Uquillas record\u00f3 que recibi\u00f3 una obra pr\u00e1cticamente paralizada por m\u00faltiples inconvenientes con los contratistas y la fiscalizaci\u00f3n. El proyecto tambi\u00e9n tuvo retraso en el pago de planillas. Hasta abril de 2018 la obra ten\u00eda menos del 90% de avance. Pero los trabajos se aceleraron y la central inici\u00f3 la operaci\u00f3n experimental en septiembre; para finales de octubre recibi\u00f3 la licencia de operaci\u00f3n comercial. Carlos P\u00e9rez se\u00f1al\u00f3 que la central contribuye a dejar de emitir 480.000 toneladas de CO2 al a\u00f1o, lo que equivale al funcionamiento de 106.000 veh\u00edculos. Al mismo tiempo, el Estado se ahorra $ 25,8 millones anuales en compra de di\u00e9sel, pues Delsitanisagua evita el consumo de 64,8 millones de galones de di\u00e9sel al a\u00f1o que se utilizan en generaci\u00f3n termoel\u00e9ctrica. (I)Detalles Mejora el suministro La dotaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica para las provincias de Loja y Zamora Chinchipe mejor\u00f3 con la puesta en funcionamiento de Delsitanisagua, a trav\u00e9s de la conexi\u00f3n de la Subestaci\u00f3n Cumbaratza con el Sistema Nacional Interconectado (SNI). \u00a0 63 millones de d\u00f3lares fue el valor del contrato complementario que aument\u00f3 el\u00a0 costo de la obra.

            "text": "  Wanted man shot dead in St Andrew 9:03 pm Andrew Holness  BY ARTHUR HALLEditor-at-largeHalla@jamaicaobserver.com CHINA Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) is to spend just over $1 billion to cover the planning and development cost for the long-proposed Naggo Head Technology Park in Portmore, St Catherine, and the Morant Bay Urban Centre in St Thomas.\n This will represent approximately eight per cent of the total cost of the two developments which have been on Jamaica's wish list for years. \n Last September the Government announced that both projects would be fast-tracked after the Cabinet approved joint-venture agreements between CHEC and the Factories Corporation of Jamaica (FCJ). \n Details of both agreements were presented by Prime Minister Andrew Holness in Parliament on Tuesday in response to questions posed by Peter Bunting, the Opposition spokesman on industry, investment and competitiveness. \n According to Holness, the Naggo Head project will have rentable building space of 810,000 square feet with the full development cost being approximately US$75 million. \n The Morant Bay project will have rentable building space of 365,000 square feet and is projected to cost approximately US$49.8 million. \n The FCJ, which will be leading both developments, will contribute $1.78 billion in equity for the Naggo Head Technology Park and $800 million for the Morant Bay Urban Centre. \n Holness, in his response to the questions from Bunting, said the decision to partner with CHEC on the two projects came after the Chinese firm made an unsolicited offer to the FCJ. \n \u201cOn receipt of the unsolicited investment proposal, FCJ assessed the merits of the proposal and identified that the proposal was of a unique nature,\u201d said Holness. \n He argued that the proposal was unique because CHEC, as a private investor, would arrange 100 per cent financing to facilitate the development of both projects without any Government or FCJ guarantee and without any cash contribution from the State. \n \u201cIt allows the FCJ, as an investor, to capitalise on the bilateral agreement between the Jamaican and Chinese governments whereby funding, if available, may be secured at a concessionary interest rate to be provided by a Chinese financial institution. \n \u201cIt [also] allows FCJ, without any cash injection, to maximise its return on investment of up to 70 per cent, without which [it] may not have been available to the GOJ,\u201d added Holness. \n The prime minister further argued that without going the route of a joint-venture it would be challenging to find an investor to put up the large amount of money that would be required to package the project to present to a financial institution for consideration of funding. \n Holness added that under the joint venture agreement each development will be done by a project company, with CHEC holding a 30 per cent stake in each, the FCJ 29 per cent, and 41 per cent available to other investors. \n He said both projects will be financed by a combination of debt and equity with the money to be sourced before the work begins. \n \u201cIf the loan is not secured before start-up, then CHEC is obligated to use its own resources to provide bridge financing to initiate the project and this will be in the form of a loan to the project company, which interest rate will not exceed the interest rate that would ordinarily be paid had the financing been secured with China Development Bank,\u201d said Holness. \n While not giving a start date for the two projects, Holness said they are scheduled to start at the same time and be completed together. \n When done, the Morant Bay Urban Centre is slated to house the St Thomas Municipal Council, St Thomas Parish Court, Tax Administration (Revenue Centre), an office of the Passport Immigration and Citizenship Agency and a branch of the National Insurance Fund. \n These State agencies will account for approximately 40 per cent of the available rental commercial with the other 60 per cent being made available to other Government agencies and private sector investors for rental. \n The Naggo Head Technology Park is not planned to house any Government agency as it is being targeted to offer world-class information and communications technology/business process outsourcing facilities. \n It will also facilitate an appropriate mix of industry and services for optimum functionality.  \n POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES  \n\n      Now you can read the Jamaica Observer ePaper anytime, anywhere.

The challenges to the construction of the airport have been narrowed down to a suitable acreage of flat land and construction financing. In his Independence Day address on the weekend, he announced that the long-awaited facility will be delivered next year. \u201cWe have been working on this project and have hired a reputable American firm to advise on the best way and best place for sitting an international airport,\u201d he explained, \u201cThey have advised us on an area between Woodfordhill and Wesley.\u201d Hon Skerrit revealed, \u201cWe have been discussing and negotiating the funding of the airport with a number of interested parties., Today, in the year of our Lord 2019, I can announce to you that the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China sent a special envoy to me last week to confirm that China will provide the financing to build the international airport for Dominica.\u201d The announcement was met with cheers and applause. Hon Prime Minister Skerrit quoted from the Bible that one must seek and knock and he will find. He said that the doors have been opened for Dominica to have its international airport. \u201cThis week, we visited the site and on November 8th, they will send a team to review what we have done so far and to look at the next steps. So, my dear friends, with the solid support if the People\u2019s Republic of China, Dominica will have its international airport and work will begin in earnest in 2020, the year of our Lord.\u201d In the meantime, he says, discussion is in advanced stages with several airlines to make Dominica more accessible to visitors. Hon Skerrit reported that by February, JET Blue will help bring passengers directly from New York to Dominica. Seaborne from November 12th will help connect international air carriers to Dominica with daily flights from Puerto Rico. He says Seaborne will also overnight in Dominica to allow for early departures and easier connections. Air Antilles has increased flights from four to seven days a week from Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint Maarten into Canefield Airport and Douglas Charles Airport, Hon Skerrit revealed. He also announced plans to build a new container port and cruise village. Work In front  the \u201cscenes.\u201dNot behind Your email address will not be published.

Importantes obras llevan a cabo empresas chinas en las provincias ecuatorianas de Manab\u00ed (noroeste) y Esmeraldas (norte), en la costa del Pac\u00edfico ecuatoriano, afectadas por el terremoto del 16 de abril de 2016. El aporte financiero del gobierno chino y la participaci\u00f3n del consorcio China Road and Bridge Corporation-China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CRBC-CEIEC) ha hecho posible ejecutar un proyecto de cuatro grandes obras de infraestructura en estas zonas. Se trata de la reconstrucci\u00f3n del aeropuerto internacional \"Eloy Alfaro\", en la ciudad de Manta, as\u00ed como dos puentes en las localidades de Canuto y Pimpiguas\u00ed, todas ellas en la provincia de Manab\u00ed.\u00a0 \u00a0\"China es pr\u00e1cticamente la gestora de la obra.

Se busca que Manta sea la puerta de entrada de toda Asia-Pac\u00edfico, incluida Australia, para Am\u00e9rica del Sur, de personas y mercanc\u00edas. Eso va a dinamizar el turismo, los negocios y el comercio con Singapur, China, Jap\u00f3n, entre otros. La obra aeroportuaria proyecta un flujo de 115 mil pasajeros por a\u00f1o frente a los 50 mil actuales, adem\u00e1s de que su construcci\u00f3n ha generado 800 plazas de empleo, 300 de ellas de tipo directo con mano de obra local. \u00a0\"Nosotros estamos muy agradecidos.

            "text": " A Delhi Court on Monday convicted Ariz Khan, an alleged Indian Mujahideen terrorist, for the murder of encounter specialist and Delhi Police inspector Mohan Chand Sharma and other offences in connection with the 2008 Batla House encounter. Ariz has been convicted under section 186 (Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 333 (voluntarily causes grievous hurt), 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 302 (murder). He has also been held guilty under 307 (attempt to murder), 174(a) (Non-appearance in response to a proclamation) 34 (criminal intention) of the Indian Penal Code and 27 (using any prohibited weapons) of the Arms Act. On September 19, 2008, the Special Cell of Delhi Police carried out an encounter in Jamia Nagar's Batla House, in which two suspected Indian Mujahideen terrorists and Inspector Sharma died. Ariz Khan was arrested in February 2018, a decade after allegedly being on the run after the encounter at L-18 in Batla House. \"Khan, along with his associates, voluntarily caused grievous hurt to public servants. The accused intentionally and voluntarily caused murder of Inspector MC Sharma by use of gunshot,\" said Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav. The judge said that Khan and his associates also caused hurt to Head Constables Balwant Singh and Rajbir Singh. The judge further said that the evidence produced on record leaves no matter of doubt that the prosecution has proved the case beyond all reasonable doubt and that the accused is liable to be convicted. The court will hear the arguments on the point of sentencing on March 15 at 12 noon. It has also directed the investigating officer to conduct an enquiry to ascertain the financial ability of Khan and his family to give compensation to the victims. Of the five men residing in the apartment in Batla House, Mohammed Sajid and Atif Amin were killed during the encounter, Junaid and Shahzad Ahmad fled and were caught years later, while Mohammad Saif surrendered to the police. A trial court in July 2013 had sentenced Indian Mujahideen terrorist Shahzad Ahmed to life imprisonment in connection with the case. His appeal against the trial court's verdict has been pending in the high court. Who is Ariz Khan? Ariz is allegedly associated with the terror outfit Indian Mujahideen. Police claimed that he was present at Batla House, along with four others, and managed to give police a slip during the encounter. As per the statements issued during Khan's arrest in 2018, the police had said that Khan is an expert bomb maker, executioner and conspirator, and had been wanted for his involvement in various bomb blast cases in Delhi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Uttar Pradesh. Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) AT Ansari represented the Delhi Police, while advocate MS Khan represented Ariz Khan during trial proceedings in the matter.

            "text": " THE Hosororo hydropower project will be commissioned in June and the Islamic Development Bank will be approached to finance three additional hydro-powered projects during a visit by officials here in the coming week. This is according to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Guyana Energy Agency(GEA), Dr Mahender Sharma, who pointed out that the tiny hydro was completed in Hosororo, Mabaruma, Region One, for capacity-building efforts. The structure which was available in the 1980s was rehabilitated. \u201cWe are going to commission that facility sometime in June,\u201d he said.\nHe said this week the Islamic Development Bank will be approached to finance an additional three hydro-powered sites and one of them is the Ikuribisi hydro which will power the town of Bartica. \u201cWe want to rehabilitate the Moco-Moco hydropower station, which was defunct as a result of a landslide; and we want to look at a new site right in Region Nine on the Kanuku Mountain range, the Kumu falls, which together can serve the growing demand in Lethem,\u201d Dr Sharma said. In 2015, the German Government, through its German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) initiative, committed to assisting the GEA with the rehabilitation of the Hosororo Hydropower facility in Region One. The US$165,175 project received US$91,108 in financing from the Government of Guyana and US$74,067 in financing from GIZ. The resuscitated hydropower project featured a new design that was conceptualised by GEA engineers and a GIZ consultant, Sven Homscheid.\nIt entails the installation of a 20kW run-of-the-river-type micro hydropower plant, comprising a Weir/Intake structure, Penstock and Powerhouse. . The construction of the micro hydropower plant was completed in 2018 and works related to interconnection with the Mabaruma electric grid carried it into 2019.\nMeanwhile, the Moco-Moco hydropower project, Region Nine, was commissioned on November 22, 1999. The hydropower station was designed and built by the Chinese through a joint arrangement between the Governments of Guyana and China. The Moco-Moco hydropower station is a run-of-the-river, diversion-type with a high-water head. It will supply power to the community of Lethem and its environs.\nSevere rainstorms and a subsequent landslide on July 5, 2003, had resulted in a fractured penstock. Government has since been actively discussing options for its restoration. Financing is needed for a geotechnical survey to inform the project design and assist in de-risking the project. Further, the proposed Kumu Hydropower Project entails the installation of a 1.5 MW hydropower plant and construction of a transmission line.\nThe Kumu Creek, located in Region Nine (Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo), is also part of the Amazon River System. The creek originates from north of the Kanuku range, converging into the Takutu River which is a boundary river between Guyana and Brazil. The Kumu site is situated 9.5 km from the Moco-Moco hydropower station.\nThe catchment areas of Kumu and Moco-Moco adjoin each other. The Kumu power station site is located 13 km south-east of the town of Lethem. CONSTANT WATER LEVEL \nThe Kumu hydropower project topographical specifications can accommodate the construction of a small reservoir on the top of the mountain plateau, so as to maintain a constant water level for operation of the plant. According to the GEA, together with the Moco Moco hydropower station, the Kumu hydropower plant can be a strong, reliable and redundant power supplier and controller for existing and future demand. Additionally, the proposed Ikuribisi hydropower project entails the installation of a 1 MW hydropower plant and construction of a transmission line between the plant and the Bartica Power Station. The site is situated about 45 km south of the town of Bartica, Region Seven (Cuyuni-Mazaruni). The hydropower system will be run as an energy-storage hydropower plant with a reservoir which can serve as a seasonal storage system. The project will provide electricity from an indigenous and renewable energy source to serve the demand of Bartica. Bartica is considered the gateway to interior locations.\nBartica has been designated Guyana\u2019s first \u2018green\u2019 town. The \u2018Green\u2019 Bartica Plan is a Government of Guyana initiative that involves a holistic approach to sustainable economic growth in the township. The main objectives of the plan are to create a climate-resilient economy and to establish a green pathway for the foundation of a new Guyana, which will result in reducing the overall carbon footprint in electricity, agriculture, fisheries, water, forestry, waste, manufacturing, transport, construction, tourism and other sectors.\nThis project forms a complementary suite of energy initiatives to support the \u2018Green\u2019 Bartica Plan. In addition to hydropower, a 1.5 MW solar farm is being developed to displace diesel generators. The hydropower plant will add additional capacity to the grid to meet the town\u2019s growing demand, which currently ranges from 2 MW to 3 MW. Lama Avenue,\nBel Air Park,\nGeorgetown,\nGuyana.

Any submissions made on our comment section, are solely the views of the individual and not Barbados Today. Please keep out the plastic rice and other fake goods that allegedly come from China. Barbados selling its soul @Lola\u2026 \u2013 they have no choice.  It is an off shoot of mental inferiority, lack of self governance and financial self management.  So sad really.  And they do not even tell the masses what they are signing us onto. Some people think that when they pilfer or financially mismanage that things stop there, but this only leads to further lock down by these nations who has always disliked this majority people.  Mind u the ones who pilfer and mis-manage \u2013 both them and their grand children will also be caught in the noose. More dragons bout hey dancing bout \u2026.more demons unleashing The only good thing about getting into bed with China, is that they know how to deal with their murderers and hardened criminals\u2026\u2026. and crooked politicians. These politicians trying their very best to get rid of Bajans, fair or foul. If unemployment, taxes or criminals don\u2019t kill us, the Chinese certainly will. What the ching chung ping long sh ite? The Chinese are not philanthropists. They have been buttering us up for years with free handouts such as computers etc.; they are masters at the long game. Now we are seeing the other shoe drop. They will be having a significant presence in construction and they will also be shipping their inferior products here. What do we get out of this? A photo op. Like that pedipac, mind u black people do not even want to know what the game is, they just jump head first into the deep water, then to realize that they cannot swim.  How deep do these people mean?? what is the back drop?? Black people need to DECIST from buying any products NOT WRITTEN IN ENGLISH.  Forget the rice for a moment, there is also other products. oh lord\u2026more plastic to eat\u2026 Looka more fake food bout hey. Oh Lord now! Beware of the Greeks bearing gifts Stupid Aren\u2019t China in the middle of buying Barbados!!!!!! @Jennifer. Thank God for Google translate.

These indecipherable words mean \u201cLearn how to speak Chinese.\u201d The way how things are going, we will need a Chinese dictionary to read the directions on most of our products. @Pedipac \u2013 lol.\nOne set of people that the so called Chinese will not get their hooks into is the so called white nations \u2013 (them got more sense).  When going into any deal the white nations they will set up clear DEMARCATED lines of do and don\u2019t s or yes and no\u2019s.  But this black people will not even set a line, let alone a margin.    They have learnt absolutely nothing over the years. OMG!!!\nI wonder how much longer before they start treating us the way they treat the Africans. Smh Barbados done souled\u2026\u2026pun intended! Siriusly!\n\u201cThese fields beyond recall\u201d are NO longer wunna own. Oh lawd have mercy on us ,nothing good comes from China. All the money that was borrowed ain\u2019t enough .Watch China setting up little stores ,them and de Indians goin fight ,also don\u2019t forget they run the nail shops and stuff,they have the money to set up there big fancy shops ,be careful Barbados. What is Madam Mia saying about all this? Whose intrest is being considered and whose being protected. Looked how we the majority are being edged into 4th class citizenship in a land of which we are proud,when the occasion arises, to sing a claim to These Fields and Hill beyond recall. What cooperation can we deepen with a bully of a nation whose foreign policy to underdeveloped countries is more akin to shylockism and friend upon countries unafraid to deepen ties with Taiwan\nFriends of all\nSatellites of none are we Welcome to the new owners of Barbados , why???? And here my friend\u2019s is where the rot sets in. Be braced. Mistake Do not allow China to get control via loans or such else they will own you .. Look to some of the countries of Africa that have gotten into debit with China and the results . It is one thing to deepen cultural exchanges and ties but not to loose your independence.  \u201c\u201d,  implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.is  mandate by China to broaden its control and influence \u201d https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/africa-cancels-a-bri-project-for-the-first-time/articleshow/66363312.cms What is wrong with the people of Barbados my country my home that I love. Don\u2019t you read you are supposed to we\u2019ll educated but that\u2019s not common sense China don\u2019t even treat they own people with any kind of dignity what do you think they are going to do to black people in Barbados when you can\u2019t pay them back whatever you get from them. Bill Gates just had to pay them 7omillion on behalf of Nigeria. Wake up people of Barbados . what are you going to tell your grandchildren how you stood by and allow a few people to sell your country out. Our for parents are rolling in their grave to see what is happening to the country they gave their life for hang and the who were lucky was exile never to return. Open your eyes!!!!! China isn\u2019t half as bad as the Imf \u2026 I\u2019m not shocked and I\u2019m pretty sure bajans are going to run them out in due time. We are physically stronger and if bajans don\u2019t want you on the island best believe they\u2019ll push you out and say \u201ccar wanna a** from bout hea\u201d Have you ever tried wearing a dress pants, or even a pair of jeans made in China??? They all have short crotches, and are very uncomfortable. The clothing speaks to us as bajans. If we allow the Chinese to get a firm grip on our balls, our sovereignty gone with the wind. I don\u2019t trust them period. Should have borrowed the money from China. New Colonizers\u2026. Maybe you all people who commenting negatively will feel much better if a white country like USA of Canada take over instead of China. Well whites currently own this people, so it will be just a partnership of ownership at the end of the day.  @Johnny \u2013 this is why black people need to have their own designers and clothing makers as their shape and built is very different to that of the so called Chinese.  Something like a black global agenda.  This is what all global black leaders should be aspiring to do, instead of buying into that same old mentality.  Our people have made so many major mistakes. Lord have mercy on us. what the hell tell muh why do we want to get in bed with these damn CHINES  why why why ? somebody anybody tell muh why oh my goodness. @Hayden Weeks \u2013 good point, and that is also the main problem.  This people is just PHYSICALLY stronger and nothing more.  No financial might, no economic might, no systemic might, no spiritual might and absolutely no MILITARY MIGHT.  This is y this majority were enslaved in the first place. The Chinese is a very strategic people. This is what happens when people r not held accountable or asked/made to pay up. So we only want the Chinese for the Gymnasium, the Wyndham Hotel and all those laptops that were delivered to the Ministry of Education; many of which made their way to a Christ Church constituency. Interesting! \u201c\u2026the implementation of this memorandum would enable Barbados to partner with China to launch transformational infrastructure projects, including the area of transportation.\u201d This initiative will transform the island\u2019s crumbling infrastructure\u2014 roads, sewage treatment system and public transportation. This writer looks forward to a road network that is smooth as velvet, four-lane highways with looping overpasses and flyovers, teacup handle intersections and center turning lanes to relieve congestion.  More importantly, Barbados should complement its bus service with monorail and hydrofoil systems to promote park-and-ride to ease the flow of traffic, particularly on roads within a five-mile radius of Bridgetown. Designated bus lanes and more one-way roads must be the order of the day. HOV (High Occupancy Vehicles) will be rewarded for carpooling and be allowed established road privileges. Moving towards a digital and cashless society for basic transactions must be at the forefront of this transformation \u2014 prepaid metro/smart cards and a transfer system, making payments from mobile devices, an app for tracking buses, Uber or lyft car service\u2026. The opportunities are endless! This MOU with China to deepen cooperation since establishing the 1970s relationship between the two countries is critical at this juncture.  Dr. Don Marshall, a proponent of Chinese funding, must be smiling from ear to ear and will not feel so pressured to stage his long-awaited one-man protest in Bridgetown for entering an IMF program. More CHEAP goods will flood the Island. Tell them to stop flooding the World textile market with its inferior  brand of KENTE cloth. The real thing comes from West Africa. Perhaps we can now figure out who is really behind this push for the Transport Board to purchase a fleet of electric buses,without putting a few of them on trial around the island.\nhttps://www.mycarforum.com/topic/2712417-lta-buys-electric-buses-from-china/ Countries around the world are now rethinking the readily available loans offered by China for infrastructure projects in their countries, after fearing they could fall prey to Beijing\u2019s debt-trap diplomacy\u2026China funded projects also require the hiring of Chinese-owned contractors rather than local companies and workers. Chinese loans, with interest rates of 2-3 per cent, are 1,100 per cent more expensive than those from Japan, at only 0.25-0.75 per cent,\u201d reports Philippine Daily Inquirer.

            "text": " ACCESSWIRE08 Mar 2021, 21:01 GMT+10 MONTREAL, QC / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2021 / Critical Elements Lithium Corporation (TSXV:CRE)(OTCQX:CRECF)(FSE:F12) ('Critical Elements' or the 'Company') is pleased to provide an update on progress on the Rose Lithium Tantalum Project ('Rose' or the 'Project'). Highlights A New Phase of Exploration Critical Elements announces that it has engaged Geo Data Solutions GDS Inc. to conduct a high-resolution heliborne magnetic survey of 17,187 km linear over the Rose Lithium-Tantalum project and its large portfolio of properties located in James Bay that cover approximately 700 square kilometers. The objective of the survey is to identify structures that would be high-priority lithium targets for future exploration. The survey is expected to be completed by the end of March. By covering the known mineralisation on the Rose deposit and the known H\u00e9lico, Pivert, and Lemare showings, their geophysical signatures will be useful to identify similar signatures and corresponding structures that may be associated with spodumene-bearing pegmatite. In addition to potentially identifying spodumene, the survey will also generate prospective targets for nickel and copper mineralization. 'We are very excited to be starting this airborne survey covering our large landscape of properties covering more than 700 square kilometers' stated Jean-Sebastien Lavall\u00e9e, Critical Elements' Chief Executive Officer. 'Surveying the known mineralisation area will help to demonstrate the high potential for new lithium discoveries in that lithium district where Critical Elements owns the largest strategic position.' Critical Elements' President, Dr. Steffen Haber, reiterated the Company's vision to become a large responsible supplier of lithium to the flourishing electric vehicle and energy storage systems industries. 'Our Rose Project features one of the purest lithium deposits globally. Quebec is strategically well-positioned regarding the critical transitioning energy and e-mobility markets in Europe and the United States and boasts excellent infrastructure including low-cost, low-carbon hydroelectricity, as well as human capital. Our cooperative relationship with the Cree Nation of Eastmain, the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), and the Cree Nation Government has been formalized through the Pikhuutaau Agreement signed in July 2019. We are excited by the anticipated receipt of Provincial and Federal Phase I permitting, detailed engineering and financing for the construction of the Rose mine and concentrator, and the delivery of engineering studies for Phase II (a chemical plant for conversion of Rose spodumene concentrate to high quality lithium hydroxide for use in lithium-ion batteries).' Rose Permitting Update Critical Elements continues to be thankful for the progress being made in the permitting process by provincial and federal officials through the challenges posed during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The Chairman of the Environmental and Social Impact Review Committee ('COMEX') has completed public hearing sessions in mid-February in Matagami, Eastmain, and Nemaska. The public hearings were held virtually and broadcast live via Facebook and LiveStream. A room was made available in each of the communities so that people who wish to gather in person can do so in compliance with current applicable health and safety standards given the COVID-19 pandemic. The COMEX's mission is to contribute to the protection of human health and the environment and to the economic and social well-being of the peoples inhabiting the territory governed by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA) that lies south of the 55th parallel. Once the environmental and social impact assessment and review procedure is completed, the COMEX will make a recommendation in respect of the authorization of the Project by provincial authorities. The Rose Lithium-Tantalum Project is in direct line with the governmental orientations contained in the Qu\u00e9bec Plan for the Development of Critical and Strategic Minerals 2020-2025 and the 2030 Plan for a Green Economy. Lithium and tantalum are world renowned in manufacturing and automotive industrial sectors, including for, among others, the market of hybrid and electric cars in this era of increasing interest for energy transition. The Federal Government runs a parallel permitting process to that of the Province of Qu\u00e9bec. The Joint Assessment Committee established by the Committee has confirmed that it has received all information required to allow the Committee to complete the environmental assessment of the Project and prepare the draft environmental assessment report. The Company has been advised by the Agency that due to the particular and challenging circumstances caused by the pandemic, the Committee needs more time to consult with local communities in order to complete the environmental assessment process. On March 4, 2021, the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada stated that 'The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, under subsection 27(3) of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, has extended by 90 days the time limit for issuance of the Decision Statement for the proposed Rose Lithium-Tantalum Mining Project to recognize the extenuating circumstances arising from the COVID\u201019 pandemic and its impacts to consulted Cree communities.' The Company has been advised by the Agency that due to the particular and challenging circumstances caused by the pandemic, the Committee needs more time to consult with local communities in order to complete the environmental assessment process. 'The economy of tomorrow will be driven by strategic sectors, like the electric vehicles and batteries sectors. This vision aligns perfectly with our vision to become a large responsible supplier of lithium. We represent perfectly sustainable development with our project that is, not only good for the environment, but that is good for the development of local communities,' stated Mr. Lavall\u00e9e. 'We remain confident in the progress being made in advancing the Rose project and excited by our intended contribution to the economy of the James Bay and Northern Quebec region, as well as the Province of Qu\u00e9bec.' Qualified persons Michel Allard, Eng., is the qualified person that has reviewed and approved the technical contents of this news release on behalf of the Corporation. About Critical Elements Lithium Corporation Critical Elements Lithium Corporation aspires to become a large, responsible supplier of lithium to the flourishing electric vehicle and energy storage system industries. To this end, Critical Elements Lithium is advancing the wholly owned, high purity Rose lithium project in Quebec. Rose is our first lithium project to be advanced within a highly prospective land portfolio of over 700 square kilometers. In 2017, the Corporation completed a robust feasibility study on Rose Phase 1 for the production of high quality spodumene concentrate. The internal rate of return for the Project is estimated at 34.9% after tax, with a net present value estimated at C$726 million at an 8% discount rate. Capital and operating cost parameters were confirmed in 2019 by Primero Group in the context of a Guaranteed Maximum Price under an Early Contractor Involvement agreement, as a prelude to an Engineering, Procurement and Construction process. Detailed engineering for Phase I is expected to conclude this year as we also deliver technical studies for Phase II, the conversion of spodumene concentrate to high quality lithium hydroxide. In our view, Quebec is strategically well-positioned for US and EU markets and boasts exceptional infrastructure including a low-cost, low-carbon power grid featuring 93% hydroelectricity. We have a strong, formalized relationship with the Cree Nation. For further information, please contact: Jean-S\u00e9bastien Lavall\u00e9e, P.

            "text": " By The Caribbean Camera Inc. on December 2, 2015Comments Off on Sam Lord\u2019s Castle to rise again BRIDGETOWN, Barbados \u2013 The redevelopment of the nearly 200-year-old Sam Lord\u2019s Castle into a hotel managed by the world\u2019s largest hotel company will bring with it 3,000 local jobs, Prime Minister Freundel Stuart says. Addressing the groundbreaking ceremony at the 57-acre site in the eastern parish of St. Philip, he said the new Sam Lord\u2019s Castle Barbados, a Wyndham Grand Resort, is also expected to bring in significant amounts of foreign exchange. \u201cThe macro-economic implications of the project cannot be understated. The hotel will employ in excess of 1,000 persons after completion and is also expected to generate approximately 2,000 additional jobs in other sectors of the economy. \u201cForeign exchange earnings to be made by the property are estimated at over US$70 million a year, with a direct contribution to the GDP of US$35 million,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cThe people of St. Philip will gain social and economic benefits from the project. Residents of this parish will be able to earn income as entrepreneurs, service and produce providers and hotel employees. A number of farmers in the area will now have another market for their produce and artists and craftsmen will also reap a similar benefit.\u201d The development will involve construction of an upscale resort hotel comprising 350 guest accommodations, 100 vacation ownership units, a destination spa, a conference centre and various services and amenities. The project is being financed by the Chinese. Sam Lord\u2019s Castle was once a beautiful Georgian mansion, built in 1820 by Samuel Hall Lord. Legend has it that Sam Lord acquired his wealth by plundering ships, which he lured onto coastal reefs, by hanging lanterns in coconut trees. Captains mistook these lights for Bridgetown and wrecked their ships on the reefs. The property was run as a hotel for many years but was subsequently abandoned and then destroyed by fire in 2010.

            "text": " Login Jamaica 2 min read The much talked about Naggo Head Technology Park in Portmore, St Catherine is to be developed at a cost of US$75 million (J$9.5 billion) while the Morant Bay Urban Centre on the compound of the old Goodyear factory in St Thomas will be constructed at a cost of approximately US$50 million J$6.25 billion). The lead contractor on the two joint venture projects will be China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), which will spend more than $1 billion of its own funds in the planning and development phases. The other main joint venture partner will be the Factories Corporation of Jamaica (FCJ) which will\u00a0be the lead agency for the two mega projects. The FCJ will put up equity of $1.78 billion for the Naggo Head project and $800 million for the Morant Bay Urban Centre. This was disclosed\u00a0by Prime Minister Andrew Holness as he answered questions from Central Manchester Member of Parliament, Peter Bunting, in the House of Representatives. Holness\u00a0said\u00a0that under the terms of the joint venture agreement, each development will be done by a project company, with CHEC holding a 30 per cent stake in each, the FCJ 29 per cent, while 41 per cent will be made available to other investors. The Prime Minister disclosed that the Naggo Head location will primarily be housing businesses in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector. It will have some 810,000 square feet of rentable space. Several government agencies will be sited at the Morant Bay Urban Centre. These include Tax Administration Jamaica, the St Thomas Municipal Corporation, the Passport Immigration and Citizenship Agency and a branch of the National Insurance Fund. They will account for 40 per cent of the 365,000 square of office space that will be available for rent. While welcoming the development of the old Goodyear site, Member of Parliament for Eastern St Thomas, urged that attention to be paid to environmental matters. He said the aquifer at the site is said to be the best water source in the parish and must be protected.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a press conference in Ottawa on March 5, 2021. The government has assured Canadians a rapid increase in vaccine deliveries will see the country closing the inoculation gap. Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

Re Global Vaccine Acceptance Rising, But Canadians Wary Of Rollout, Poll Finds (March 5): I am happy to say that I finally have some compliments to offer regarding the vaccine rollout. My kudos to Trillium Health Partners in Mississauga for their organization. The process began with notification by e-mail, followed up by telephone confirmation. On site, there was great signage, easy accessibility, no lineups and total concern for safety and sanitization. Story continues below advertisement In my case, being over 80, I got a Pfizer vaccine. At the same time, they gave me an appointment for the second dose 28 days from now. It was all executed by a welcoming team of young student volunteers and older professionals. What a joyful and much-anticipated day. Gail Rutenberg Mississauga Re Ottawa\u2019s Vaccine Promises Out Of Step With Reality (March 5): Comparisons to the United States often fail to credit Operation Warp Speed and the millions of dollars spent on \u201cpre-approved\u201d vaccine purchases. It was a gamble worthy of a casino owner. When he rolled the dice, it came up a winner. Jorge Stathos Toronto The comparison of Canada and the United States squarely puts our shortcomings on a lack of manufacturing capability. That is not the whole story. A presidential order forbade the U.S. export of vaccines. Joe Biden continues to support that, and says that no vaccine will be exported until every American is vaccinated. That was a major setback. Story continues below advertisement We should acknowledge and be grateful that the European Union has not taken a similar position. Be careful with whom one does business. We were wise to procure an oversupply. Emile van Nispen Toronto In case some Canadians are puzzled by the uncertain response of our public servants and their political masters to the pandemic, I feel obliged to point out that problems such as this are fraught with scientific and economic uncertainty. This would be unlike other situations where they have demonstrated effective decision making, especially when facts are well known and uncertainty is low \u2013 situations such as fighter jet and warship procurement, or replacing a payroll system. Paul Bond Toronto The dramatic graph accompanying this report surely triggers national anxiety, especially when we see countries such as Lithuania and Turkey far ahead of us in the inoculations race. Story continues below advertisement It\u2019s harder to notice that Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong are far behind us. I guess that means their negotiators didn\u2019t have their elbows up high enough either. Sheila Petzold Ottawa Plans to increase supply are promising \u2013 if only public health would mobilize all willing and capable manpower to actually give the 17 per cent of available vaccines that have not been administered. This is a recurrent and relatively stable statistic on A2 of The Globe and Mail. Until that happens, I am skeptical that more supply will answer Canada\u2019s pandemic problems. It would be extremely cost-effective to carry out such a mobilization, and it would cost less than pouring many millions into getting more vaccine from whatever source. Richard van der Jagt MD, FRCPC; adjunct professor of medicine, University of Ottawa Earlier in the pandemic, The Globe and Mail was critical of Canada\u2019s pandemic response, wondering why we could not be more like South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but thankful we were nowhere comparable to countries such as the United States, Britain or Israel. Now that vaccines are rolling out, The Globe wonders why we cannot be more like the U.S., Britain and Israel as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand lag behind in vaccinations. Story continues below advertisement The simple fact is that I would grade Canada\u2019s pandemic report card as a solid C, like we have become the dead-centre on the world\u2019s bell curve. Our approach to this pandemic is neither anything to be proud of nor ashamed. It is just so average. There was a time when Canada punched well above its weight. I miss those days. Mike Winward Hamilton Re PMO Rushed To Contain Fallout From GPHIN Shutdown, E-mails Show and PMO Alerted To Concerns About Vance In 2018 (March 5): The Globe and Mail\u2019s front page makes it clear to me: The Prime Minister\u2019s Office has become the tail that wags Canadian democracy. Increasingly, the PMO seems to substitute itself for the civil service, depriving policymakers of expert and impartial advice. Now the icing on the cake: The PMO itself is run by \u201cissues\u201d managers, for whom managing the government\u2019s image and containing the \u201cfallout\u201d takes priority over delivering the policies and programs that Canadians need. There is an opportunity here for other parties to challenge the centralization of power in partisan offices, but of course they will have to override their own issue managers to do so. Story continues below advertisement Tom Slee Waterloo, Ont. I guess we\u2019re all going to vote Green or NDP. The Liberals continue to amaze me with an impressive combination of incompetence, entitlement and short-sightedness. At the same time, the Conservatives seem to have no idea what to stand for as a party. What have we done to deserve such leadership? Peter Hambly Hanover, Ont. It is wonderful to wake up to The Globe and Mail each morning. If one is Conservative, this edition is exceptional. Is it any wonder that confidence in our government is eroding, and that many of us are depressed and anxious? Please give us a reason to take pride in our country and the incredible effort of our government to steer us through turbulent waters. We should have more appreciation and less criticism. Story continues below advertisement Carol Victor Burlington, Ont. Re Canada Post Halts Delivery To Some Toronto High-rises, Citing COVID-19 Concerns (March 5): The headline should simply read: \u201cCanada Posts halts delivery.\u201d Since October, 2020, Canada Post has lost three of my parcels and three birthday cards. COVID-19 is cited as the problem. If I were to send personal protective equipment to the sorting centre, could they manage to deliver my grandson\u2019s birthday gift? Jane Crist Collingwood, Ont. Re Pandemic Eats Into Bank CEOs\u2019 Pay Hikes (Report on Business, March 5): There were no actionable recommendations to right this tragic loss of millions of dollars for bank CEOs. As a responsible citizen, I am contemplating a crowdfunding campaign where citizens of this nation will come to the aid of suffering CEOs. Thousands of homeless people were so generous as to donate to this noble effort, as did children\u2019s societies in diverting funds to this cause. No human being should be subjected to losing 1.5 per cent of their income in these troubled times, and forced to subsist on a measly $13.5-million.

He said that the national vaccination campaign has been accelerated, and explained that the restrictions could be radically eased once people over the age of 60 and those living with some kind of chronic illness \u2014 who are most at risk \u2014 receive the jab, the Xinhua news agency reported. The restrictions in force include a curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m., the mandatory wearing of face masks, the closure of theaters, cinemas, hotels, and the switch to digital education for secondary and college students. Restaurants are allowed to offer takeaway services only. Hungary currently has stocks of vaccines from five producers. These include China\u2019s Sinopharm vaccine, the first shipment of which arrived in Budapest on February 16. Hungary has already started to administer the Sinopharm vaccine as a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic looms, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Wednesday. The country on Thursday registered 4,385 new Covid-19 cases in a 24-hour span, raising the national total to 414,514, according to official data. In the past 24 hours, 120 people have died from the disease, taking the toll to 14,672 in the country, while 315,781 have recovered.

What are the questions that need answering? \n\u2013 How will the royal family respond and how will they restore their damaged reputation? \n The royal family and their aides have some challenging questions to answer about why a suicidal Meghan was not supported and given help, and about the accusations of racism.   The Queen, known for her calm approach, is never reactive or rash during challenging times, but the allegations mark a crisis point for the monarchy and its future. Prince William and his wife Kate have long been vocal campaigners on the issue of mental health so questions remain about their involvement and what their response will be. \n\u2013 Who made the racist comment about how dark their baby\u2019s skin would be? \n The couple refused to say which member of the royal family had this conversation with Harry while Meghan was pregnant with Archie.   Meghan said: \u201cThat was relayed to me from Harry, those were conversations the family had with him, and I think it was really hard to be able to see those as compartmentalised conversations.\u201d Harry said he will never reveal who said it and what was said, but this will not stop the speculation. \n\u2013 What damage has been done to Harry and Meghan\u2019s relationship with the royal family? \n At this stage, the damage could be irreparable.

The interview is likely to be seen \u2013 either by the press or the royals or both \u2013 as an attack on the whole family, and how will William react to Meghan singling out Kate? Harry has, however, spoken of his closeness to the Queen. \n\u2013 What did Kate say to Meghan to make her cry? \n Meghan said it was Kate who left her in tears over the flower girl dresses, not the other way round as was reported.   \u201cIt was a really hard week of the wedding, and she was upset about some things,\u201d she said. Kate apologised and sent flowers and a note. But Meghan said it was a turning point when the false story was not put straight. \n\u2013 Who did Meghan approach in the Palace for help when feeling suicidal? \n Meghan said she went to \u201cone of the most senior people\u201d. She sent emails and begged for help and people said \u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s disproportionately terrible\u2026 but nothing was ever done\u201d, she claimed. \n\u2013 Why was Meghan not supported \u2013 especially after Diana's experience? \n Meghan said: \u201cThere was no guidance\u2026 there\u2019s no class on how to speak, how to cross your legs, how to be royal, there\u2019s none of that training.\u201d   She added: \u201cThat might exist for other members of the family\u201d but said it was not offered to her. If that was the case, why was Meghan not given help and support? \n\u2013 Who was jealous of Meghan? \n Harry indicated that members of the royal family were jealous of Meghan because of the ease with which she carried out royal duties on their tour of Australia and New Zealand. \n\u2013 What about Meghan\u2019s father? \n Meghan has been estranged from Thomas Markle since her wedding, but Winfrey was not seen questioning Meghan about their relationship. Does she intend to reach out to her father, and he will ever meet Harry or their children? \n\u2013 Why did Meghan think Archie should be a prince? \n Meghan said she wanted Archie to be a prince so he could have police protection, and expressed her shock at the idea of the first member of colour in the family not being titled in the same way as other grandchildren.   But seventh in line Archie is not at this stage entitled to be a prince because of rules established more than 100 years ago by King George V. \n\u2013 Why didn\u2019t the Queen make Archie a prince? \n The Queen stepped in ahead of Prince George\u2019s birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure all of William and Kate\u2019s children, not just George, would have fitting titles. Their children are the offspring of a future monarch whereas Archie is not. He will be entitled to be an HRH or a prince however when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne. \n\u2013 What about the alleged bullying Meghan is accused of? \n The interview was filmed before the Times revealed that a senior aide raised concerns over bullying and that Meghan allegedly drove out two personal assistants and humiliated another, which the duchess denies.   Questions still remain as to what exactly went on and how Meghan treated her staff. Buckingham Palace has launched an investigation. \n\u2013 What will Harry and Meghan name their daughter? \n With the couple set to have a baby girl, the bookmakers will be predicting Diana as the frontrunner. Or perhaps even Elizabeth in honour of the Queen.

            "text": " Watch CBSN Live \n \nMarch 8, 2021 / 8:07 AM\n          / CBS News\n         Oprah Winfrey is sharing more of her groundbreaking interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, after the two-hour program aired on CBS Sunday night. In the previously unaired clips, the couple discuss why they believe race played a difference in how Meghan was treated by Buckingham Palace and British tabloids. They also open up about a visit to see Queen Elizabeth that was suddenly called off after the couple's decision to step back from royal duties in early 2020. The Sunday special saw the Duchess of Sussex break with previous media narratives, telling Winfrey that Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, had made her cry days before her wedding. Previous reporting had stated that Meghan made Kate cry over arrangements for the ceremony.\u00a0 The Duchess of Sussex also revealed their second child, due this summer,\u00a0would be a girl. They also claimed there were concerns expressed within Buckingham Palace before their first son, Archie, was born, about how dark his skin color might be. Winfrey, who joined \"CBS This Morning\" the day after the interview aired, said Prince Harry wanted to make it clear that the remarks were not made by Queen Elizabeth or Prince Phillip. \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King said Winfrey called the \"best interview\" of her career.\u00a0 \"Did you leave the country because of racism?\" Winfrey asked the couple in the first previously unaired clip. Prince Harry said \"it was a large part of it,\" recalling one event in particular. \"I remember the Sentebale fundraiser,\" he said. \"And one of the people at that dinner said to me, 'Please don't do this with the media. They will destroy your life.' This person is friends with a lot of editors and like that.\" Harry continued, \"I said, 'Sorry, elaborate what do you mean by that?' So I knew. He said, 'Please understand the U.K. is very bigoted.' And I stopped and said, 'The U.K. is not bigoted. The U.K. press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids. Is that what you mean?'\u00a0 \"He goes, 'No, the U.K. is bigoted.' And I said, 'I completely disagree.' But unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased, then that filters out to the rest of society.\" \u00a0In the second clip, the Duke of Sussex spoke to Winfrey about how a trip to see Queen Elizabeth II was suddenly called off following a letter to Buckingham Palace in early 2020 in which they told the royal family they would be stepping back from their formal duties. \"That announcement that we put out on the 8th of January in 2020, that was \u2014 the content of that was put in a letter to the institution, to my father, which was then shared at the end of December while we were in Canada,\" Prince Harry said. \"And to then get back on the 6th after my grandmother had said 'The moment you land, come up.'\" Meghan said she and Harry had asked if they could go see the monarch. According to Harry, the queen said, \"Yeah, come up to Sandringham. Love to have a chat. Come for tea. Why don't you stay for dinner? It's going to be a long drive and you're going to be exhausted.\" \"She wanted us to stay the night,\" Meghan added. The prince said they would have \"loved that,\" until he received a message from his private secretary \"the moment we landed in the U.K.\" \"Private secretary is sort of a CEO role within the institution,\" Meghan said. Harry said his then private secretary Fiona was \"cutting and pasting a message from the Queen's private secretary, basically.\" \"Please pass along to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that he cannot come to Norfolk. The queen is busy. She's busy all week,\" he said the letter read.\u00a0 He went on, \"She'd just invited me. The queen's busy. She's busy all week. Do not come up here.\" Harry said he called his grandmother from Frogmore Cottage that night, where the couple had lived before Archie was born. He asked her if be could come anyway, but he heard she was busy. \"And she said, 'Yes, I have something in my diary that I didn't know that I had.' And I said, 'Well, what about the rest of the week?' She goes, 'Well that's busy now as well.\" He said he did not want to push, \"because I kind of knew what was going on.\" \"Doesn't the queen get to do what the queen wants to do?\" Winfrey asked.\u00a0 Harry said no. \"When you're head of the firm, there is people around you that give you advice,\" he said. \"And what has also made me really sad is some of that advice has been really bad.\" In the two-hour special interview, Meghan and Harry discussed feeling alienated from the rest of the royal family, with Harry classifying his relationship with older brother William, Duke of Cambridge, as needing \"space.\" The third clip Winfrey shows on \"CBS This Morning\" features the couple describing the environment in which Harry was raised, and how the royal family compared Meghan's tabloid coverage with that of Kate, Duchess of Cambridge\u00a0 \"You've had these conversations with your family members. They know why you left,\" Winfrey said. \"So has anybody said, 'I'm sorry you had to make that move,' or, 'I'm sorry you felt that you had to do that because you felt we were not supporting you'?\" Harry said nobody had. \"The feeling is that this was our decision, therefore the consequences are on us. And despite three years of asking for help and seeing, or visualizing how this might end \u2014 it was, I don't know, just \u2014 look, its been really hard. Because I'm trying. I'm part of the system with them. I always have been.\" The prince said he was aware his older brother, second in line for the throne, could not leave the system like he had.\u00a0 Asked if Prince William did want to leave the system, Harry said \"I don't know. I can't speak for him.\" \"But with that relationship and that control and the fear by the U.K. tabloids, it's a really \u2014 it's a toxic environment. But I will always be there for him. I will always be there for my family. And as I said, I've tried to help them to see what has happened,\" Prince Harry said. Winfrey asked him if his family \u2014 his father Charles, for example \u2014 agreed the environment was toxic. \"No, I think he's had to make peace with it,\" Harry said. Meghan said she could not make peace with it herself because the situation was different. \"I think what they \u2014 and this is why I would say, and I can't speak for them either \u2014 if they're not able to see that this was different, then what happened to Kate when she was, you know,\" Meghan said. Winfrey asked if race was the difference. \"And social media,\" Meghan answered. \"That didn't exist. And so it was like the wild, wild west. It was spread like wildfire. Plus my being American, it translated in a different way across the pond. So you had a noise level that was very different. But they can't see that it's different.\" \"So you felt bullied on an international level?\" Winfrey asked. Meghan said, \"I think the volume of what was coming in and the interest was greater because of social media, because of the fact that I was not just British, and that unfortunately, if members of his family say, 'Well, this is what's happened to all of us' \u2014 if they can compare what the experience that I went through was similar to what has been shared with us.\" She used a nickname given to her sister-in-law before she married William as an example.\u00a0 \"Kate was called 'Waity Katie,' waiting to marry William, while I imagine that was really hard, and I do. I can't picture what that felt like. This is not the same,\" Meghan said. She continued, \"And if a member of his family will comfortably say we've all had to deal with things that are rude, rude and racist are not the same.\" The Duchess of Sussex claimed the press team that would defend the royal family \"when they know something's not true\" failed to come to their defense.\u00a0 Winfrey asked Prince Harry if he hoped his family would ever acknowledge that the differences in treatment were over race.\u00a0 \"It would make a huge difference,\" he said. \"Like I said, there's a lot of people that have seen it for what it was\u2026 like it's talked about across the world.\" The people who do not want to see it, Harry claimed, \"choose not to see it.\" For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app \nFirst published on March 8, 2021 / 8:07 AM\n \n\u00a9 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

            "text": " Myanmar security forces have besieged hundreds of young anti-coup protesters in the Yangon neighbourhood of Sanchaung. The military and its brutal practices are an omnipresent fear in Myanmar, while the masses have mounted a nationwide civil disobedience movement. Source: AAP Thousands of people took to the streets of Myanmar\u2019s biggest city in defiance of a night curfew on Monday, chanting in anger after security forces besieged hundreds of young anti-coup protesters in one neighbourhood. Western embassies appealed to the ruling military junta to allow the protesters to leave Sanchaung, where they were cornered at the end of another day of bloodshed in Myanmar in which at least three protesters were killed elsewhere in the country. \u201cFree the students in Sanchaung,\u201d people chanted in the streets in districts across the former capital, where daily protests have taken place for more than a month against the 1 February coup which overthrew elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. This Tweet has been deleted In some areas, police used stun grenades and fired shots to try to disperse protesters, witnesses said. Live video from Sanchaung on social media showed protesters running between the houses as stun grenades detonated. \u201cAlmost 200 young protesters are still blocked by the police and soldiers there. Local and international community needs to help them now! Please,\u201d one protest leader, Maung Saungkha, said on Twitter. This Tweet has been deleted The US Embassy said in a statement: \u201cWe call on those security forces to withdraw and allow people to go home safely.\u201d The United Nations office in Myanmar and the British Embassy made a similar appeal. In Geneva, the UN human rights office voiced deep concern about the fate of the protesters trapped in Sanchaung. Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said they should be allowed to leave safely and without reprisals. This Tweet has been deleted A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls requesting comment. Police said they would scrutinise family registration lists in the area to check for outsiders - threatening action against anyone caught concealing them. State television MRTV said: \u201cThe government\u2019s patience has run out and while trying to minimise casualties in stopping riots, most people seek complete stability are calling for more effective measures against riots.\u201d According to the United Nations, more than 50 people have been killed by security forces in the junta\u2019s attempts to end the protests demanding the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees and respect for the election she won last year. Two protesters died of gunshot wounds to the head in the northern town of Myitkyina on Monday, witnesses said. At least one person was killed at a protest in the town of Phyar Pon in the Irrawaddy Delta, a political activist and local media said. Earlier, protesters in some places had waved flags fashioned from htamain (women\u2019s sarongs) or hung them up on lines across the street to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Walking beneath women\u2019s sarongs is traditionally considered bad luck for men. MRTV said such a display was severely insulting to religion in largely Buddhist Myanmar. The army took power citing fraud in the ballot last November that was won by Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) - an accusation rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised another election, but without giving a date. The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions and appears to be digging in to weather the crisis, as it has in past periods of army rule. In a clampdown on independent media that has been covering the protests, state television announced the licenses of five outlets had been withdrawn. Shops, businesses and factories closed across Yangon on Monday after at least nine unions covering sectors including construction, agriculture and manufacturing called on all Myanmar people to stop work to reverse the coup. \u201cThe time to take action in defence of our democracy is now,\u201d they said in a statement. Security forces had moved in to occupy hospitals on Sunday night. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta and Australia on Sunday cut defence ties. The European Union is preparing to widen its sanctions on the army to target businesses they run and the measures could be agreed by EU foreign ministers on 22 March, according to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters. In Sweden, H&M, the world\u2019s second-biggest fashion retailer, said it had paused placing orders with direct suppliers in Myanmar - saying it was shocked at the use of deadly forces against protesters, but also worried about instability. Among those the military has detained is Suu Kyi\u2019s Australian former financial advisor. State television quoted junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing as saying the detention led to the discovery of secret financial information from the former government. Reuters was unable to contact Sean Turnell for comment. The army has not announced charges against him. Thailand\u2019s state broadcaster PBS said areas had been set aside along the border with Myanmar to house any refugees fleeing the unrest. \u00a0 Sign up now for the latest news from Australia and around the world direct to your inbox.

Energy companies say the country needs the project, while activists point to alternatives.  Planned Chilean dams, like this one in China, could provide significant power In Chile, a mammoth hydropower project is underway. The plans involve not just construction of five dams across Chile's two major rivers, the Pascua and the Baker, but also aim to build the biggest high-voltage power line in the world. The project, which was approved by the Chilean government in May 2011, is called \"HidroAysen\" - and its success hinges on construction of a high-voltage power line 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) long. That link will transport power from southern Chile to the capital Santiago and copper mines farther north. Once completed, it would be the largest power line of its kind - running through fjords, jungles, earthquake zones and national parks. If completed, the project would have an installed capacity of 2,750 megawatts, and would require an estimated total investment of over two billion euros ($3.2 billion). Chile's rising energy needs The project's sponsors have already invested $200 million (141 million euros) in the project - but they still need a building permit to begin construction. \"Chile doubled its energy consumption between 1987 and 1996, and again by 2000,\" said Daniel Fernandez, executive vice president of HidroAysen, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. As Santiago grows, Chilean officials say they need more energy production capacity \"I hope annual growth will reach four to five percent to give people more prospects. That requires a lot of energy - and demand will double again in 15 years at the latest.\" However, as is often the case in such large-scale energy projects, the HidroAysen has been met with significant protest from some local residents. Recently, tens of thousands of Chileans protested in front of the governmental palace in Santiago. \"There was room for social protest against a development model that many citizens no longer want,\" said Patricion Rodriguez, spokesman for the advocacy group, Patagonia Without Dams, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. \"They just don't want more growth and waste, they want environmental protection, fraternity and happiness. But no one talks about that - this is also a rebellion against neo-liberalism, which has ruled here for more than 30 years,\" Rodriguez said. Public protest Thai protestors have also recently protested the planned construction of a dam in Laos The public outrage stems not just from environmental concerns - it also stems from the legacy of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, more than two decades after he left the national political scene. \"From the very beginning, the project has been tainted by illegality,\" said Patricio Segura, a Chilean environmental journalist. \"10 days before Pinochet stepped down, he awarded water rights for 33-hundred cubic meters per second. That's a huge amount of water,\" Segura said. \"In a time without democracy and public regulations, large parts of the Pascua and Baker rivers were handed to a private company, behind the people's backs.\" Many activists view the energy project as a highly profitable land grab by large multi-national companies, and some of Chile's wealthiest entrepreneurs. Endesa is Chile's largest electrical power utility Endesa, the largest electrical power utility in Chile, owns a 51-percent stake in the HidroAysen project and now holds those water rights. One of the other major shareholders is Colbun, another Chilean utility company, of which the Matte family - one of Chile's wealthiest and most influential - is a minority shareholder. A call for a new Chilean energy policy \"What happens if HidroAysen isn't built?\" asked Miguel Marquez, an energy researcher at the University of Chile in Santiago. \"Chile would finally be forced to develop an energy policy - to decide for whom and what we need more energy - and at what price.\" Marquez says Chile could cut its energy needs in half by increasing efficiency. He cites the Atacama Desert as a huge potential source of solar power, and cites geothermal, biomass and 40,000 kilometers (25,000 miles) of coast that could be used for wind and wave power. Marquez says energy sector elites don't want a decentralized power market - because it could jeopardize their profits. \"The scandal here in Chile is that a small group of families controls the economy. Eighty percent of domestic production is run by about 100 companies,\" he told Deutsche Welle. \"For me, that's the big issue with HidroAysen - the economic and political concentration of power. It's disastrous, because it promotes inequality in my country and threatens democracy.\" Author: Thomas Nachtigall / cjfEditor: Louisa Schaefer Old mines in the German Harz Mountains may soon be getting a new lease of life, serving as a storage facility for excess wind power. The scheme is yet to find investors, but if it goes ahead, it will be a world first. (25.05.2011)\n\u00a0  According to the International Energy Agency, energy consumption is set to double by 2050. Demand is growing all over the world and especially in energy-ravenous India and China. (22.03.2011)\n\u00a0  As plans to build hydropower dams on the Mekong River gather pace, there are warnings that their construction could damage fish stocks, on which millions of Cambodia\u2019s most vulnerable people rely for protein.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Reuters Staff 2 Min Read MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Chinese banks are providing $600 million in financing for the construction of an oil refinery at the Mexican port of Dos Bocas in the southeastern state of Tabasco, China\u2019s ambassador to Mexico said on Monday. Ambassador Zhu Qingqiao told reporters that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China were participating in financing for the refinery, one of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s flagship infrastructure projects. It was unclear what kind of financing the banks would provide for the project, which the government says will be built for $8 billion. The price tag has been questioned as overly optimistic by critics of the project. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle later said the refinery, which would be Mexico\u2019s biggest with a crude-processing capacity of 340,000 barrels per day, is being built with public money. \u201cThe entire project, up until today, has been financed with federal (government) funds,\u201d Nahle said in an interview with local radio, apparently contradicting the ambassador. She said she was unsure if another company, or subcontractor, involved in the complex project might have received a loan from a Chinese entity. The Chinese \u201cpossibly gave a loan to some company or to someone related to working on Dos Bocas. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Nahle said. Lopez Obrador has said the refinery will be built in three years and help Mexico wean itself off a growing reliance on fuel imports, the vast majority of which come from U.S. refiners.

Located in the municipality of China, the Dolores wind farm is the group's first project in the state of Nuevo Leon, according to Enel's statement. The overall investment in the construction of the facility amounts to approximately $280 million, it added.  The farm is scheduled to start operation in the first half of 2020. Once fully operational, the wind farm will be able to generate approximately 850 gigawatt-hours per year, avoiding the annual emissions of around 470,000 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  'Dolores further strengthens our strategy in the country to address growing electricity demand and sustainable development in an impactful way by developing clean technologies in a key state which boasts outstanding wind resources,' said Antonio Cammisecra, head of Enel's global renewable energy business line, Enel Green Power.  According to the statement, the construction of Dolores will be based on Enel's 'Sustainable Construction Site' model, which includes the measuring of the project's socio-environmental impact and actions aimed at incorporating the rational use of resources. These involve water management, as well as a waste recycling project repurposing the site\u2019s wooden pallets to produce eco-friendly furniture and shipping containers to be used by the local community.  The project is supported by a contract providing for the sale to the Mexican Center for Energy Control's Camara de Compensacion of specified volumes of energy over a 15-year period and of the related clean certificates over a 20-year period.  According to the press release, the Dolores facility is one of the four wind plants awarded to the Enel Group for a total capacity of 593 MW in the third long-term auction following the country's energy reform.  In addition to the plant in Nuevo Leon, the group was awarded the Amistad II and Amistad III projects with an installed capacity of 100 MW each, and Amistad IV with an installed capacity of 149 MW, all located in Acuna, Coahuila. Enel Green Power Mexico is one of the largest renewable energy players in the country in terms of managed capacity, managing 2,014 MW as of today, of which 873 MW comes from wind, around 1,089 MW from solar and approx. 53 MW from hydro.

            "text": " \"Take It Easy\" by Travis Tritt \n Follow Us On Social Media By KATIE KINDELAN, ABC News (NEW YORK) \u2014 Each minute of Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s primetime interview with Oprah Winfrey seemed to contain another bombshell revelation, from the sex of their second child to Meghan\u2019s mental health struggles. \u201cIt\u2019s what you read in fairy tales, you think is what you know about the royals, right?,\u201d Meghan told Winfrey in the two-hour interview. \u201cSo it\u2019s easy to have an image of it that is so far from reality.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s what was really tricky over those past few years, is when the perception and the reality are two very different things and you\u2019re being judged on the perception but you\u2019re living the reality of it, there\u2019s a complete misalignment,\u201d added Meghan, who wed Harry in 2018 and stepped away from the royal family with him two years later, in 2020. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no way to explain that to people.\u201d Below are eight of the major revelations from Harry and Meghan\u2019s tell-all interview with Winfrey, their first joint interview since stepping away from their royal roles and leaving the United Kingdom. Buckingham Palace has not yet responded to claims made by Meghan and Harry in their interview with Winfrey. 1. Harry, Meghan held wedding ceremony three days before their public wedding While the public watched Prince Harry and Meghan wed on May 19, 2018, in a star-studded public wedding at St. George\u2019s Chapel, the couple held their own ceremony three days before that, Meghan told Winfrey. \u201cThree days before our wedding, we got married. No one knows that but we called the [Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby] and we just said, \u2018Look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world, but we want our union between us,\u201d said Meghan. \u201cThe vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury. Just the three of us.\u201d \u201cI think we were both really aware, even in advance of that, this, this wasn\u2019t our day,\u201d she said of her and Harry\u2019s May 19 wedding. \u201cThis was the day that was planned for the world.\u201d 2. Meghan was suicidal during her time as a royal Meghan tearfully revealed there was a breaking point where she considered suicide before she and Harry decided to step away from their roles as senior working members of Britain\u2019s royal family. \u201cI just didn\u2019t see a solution,\u201d Meghan told Winfrey. \u201cI would sit up at night, and I was just like I don\u2019t understand how all of this [press] is being churned out \u2026 and I realized it was all happening just because I was breathing.\u201d \u201cLook, I was really ashamed to say it at the time and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry, especially, because I know how much loss he\u2019s suffered, but I knew that if I didn\u2019t say it, that I would do it,\u201d said Meghan, who recalled that Harry \u201ccradled\u201d her when she told him about her mental health struggle. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be alive anymore, and that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought.\u201d The duchess recalled having that conversation with Harry the morning the two were to attend an event later that evening at Royal Albert Hall in London. When Harry said he didn\u2019t think Meghan, who was pregnant at the time, should go, Meghan recalled replying to her husband, \u201cI can\u2019t be left alone.\u201d \u201cOne of the things that, it still haunts me, is this photograph that someone had sent me,\u201d said Meghan, referring to a photograph of she and Harry at the January 2019, event. \u201cA friend said, \u2018I know you don\u2019t like at pictures, but oh my God, you guys look so great,\u2019 and sent it to me. And I zoomed in and what I saw was the truth of what that moment was.\u201d \u201cIf you zoom in, what I see is how tightly his knuckles are gripped around mine. You can see the whites of our knuckles because we are smiling and doing our job, but we\u2019re both just trying to hold on,\u201d Meghan told Winfrey. \u201cAnd every time that those lights went down in that royal box, I was just weeping, and he was gripping my hand, and then it was, \u2018Okay, intermission\u2019s coming. The lights are about to come on. Everyone\u2019s looking at us again.'\u201d \u201cAnd you have to just be \u2018on\u2019 again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s I think so important for people to remember is you\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s going on for someone behind closed doors. You have no idea. Even the people that smiled the biggest smiles and shined the brightest lights, it seems, to have compassion for what\u2019s actually potentially going on.\u201d Meghan claimed she went to \u201cone of the most senior people\u201d of the royal \u201cinstitution\u201d and was not able to get help for her mental health. Meghan alleged she also went to human resources and was told there was nothing that could be done, because she was not a \u201cpaid employee of the institution.\u201d \u201cI share this because there are so many people who are afraid to voice that they need help, and I know personally how hard it is to not just voice it, but when you voice it, to be told no,\u201d said Meghan, who said later of her mental health struggle, \u201cNothing was ever done, so we had to find a solution.\u201d \u201cIt takes so much courage to admit that you need help. It takes so much courage to voice that,\u201d Meghan told Winfrey. \u201cAnd as I said, I was ashamed. I\u2019m supposed to be stronger than that. I don\u2019t want to put more on my husband\u2019s shoulders.\u201d Harry said he too \u201cwent to a very dark place\u201d and also revealed he did not go to his family members with Meghan\u2019s mental health struggle because, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s just not a conversation that would be had. I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ve had the same feelings or thoughts,\u201d said Harry, who joined with his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Duchess Kate to launch the mental health-focused Heads Together campaign in 2016. \u201cI have no idea. It\u2019s a very trapping environment that a lot of them are stuck in.\u201d 3. Harry relied on Princess Diana\u2019s money after his family cut him off financially Harry told Winfrey that it was the money left to him by his late mom, Princess Diana, who died after a 1997 car crash in Paris, that allowed Harry and Meghan the freedom to forge their own way outside of the royal family. According to Harry, the royal family \u201cliterally cut me off financially\u201d in the first quarter of 2020, shortly after he and Meghan announced their plans to step down as senior, working royals. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got what my mum left me,\u201d Harry said of the money left for him in Diana\u2019s estate. \u201cAnd without that, we would not have been able to do this.\u201d Harry also said that his and Meghan\u2019s lucrative deals with companies including Netflix and Spotify were \u201cnever part of the plan,\u201d but became essential when he was told on \u201cshort notice\u201d while staying in Canada with Meghan and Archie that their royal security protection would be removed because of their change in status as non-working members of the royal family. After their stay in Canada, the Sussexes moved in March to California, where they stayed for several months in a home belonging to Hollywood mogul Tyler Perry, who gave them both his home and provided security. \u201cIt gave us breathing room to try to figure out what we were going to do,\u201d Meghan said of their time in Perry\u2019s Los Angeles-area mansion. When asked how Diana, who divorced Harry\u2019s father Prince Charles in 1996 after a tumultuous marriage, would feel about Harry and Meghan\u2019s situation today, Harry said he thought she would feel \u201cvery angry\u201d and \u201cvery sad\u201d at how things \u201cpanned out\u201d but would ultimately just want the family to be happy. \u201cTouching back on what you were asking, what my mum would think of this, I think she saw it coming,\u201d Harry told Winfrey. \u201cAnd I certainly felt her presence throughout this whole process.\u201d \u201cAnd for me, I\u2019m just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you, with my wife by my side,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t begin to imagine what it must have been like for [Princess Diana], going through this process by herself, all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us, but at least we had each other.\u201d 4. Harry, Meghan claim conversations were had about \u2018how dark\u2019 Archie\u2019s skin color would be While media reports at the time of Harry and Meghan\u2019s son Archie\u2019s birth in 2019 said the couple chose not to give Archie a title, Meghan claimed to Winfrey it was the royal institution\u2019s decision to not give their son either a title or security protection. \u201cThis went on for the last few months of our pregnancy, where I\u2019m going, \u2018Hold on a second,'\u201d Meghan said of the conversations around the decision, adding later there was \u201cno explanation\u201d for what she described as a \u201cchange in protocol.\u201d Meghan said she and Harry were most concerned about Archie not receiving security without a title, and said the couple was not asked to take a picture with their newborn son outside the hospital after his birth, which was portrayed in the press at the time as a break in protocol dictated by the Sussexes. \u201cWe weren\u2019t asked to take a picture. That\u2019s also part of the spin that was really damaging,\u201d said Meghan. \u201cI thought, \u2018Can you just tell them the truth? Can you say to the world you\u2019re not giving him a title and we want to keep him safe, and that if he\u2019s not a prince, then it\u2019s not part of the tradition? Just tell people and then they\u2019ll understand,\u2019 but they wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Along with conversations about Archie\u2019s title and security, there were also conversations with Harry ahead of his son\u2019s birth about \u201chow dark\u201d his skin might be, according to both Harry and Meghan. Archie was the first American British biracial royal born in the U.K., and is also widely considered to be the first mixed race child born into the royal family. When asked by Winfrey if the assumption is that if their son was \u201ctoo brown, that would be a problem,\u201d Meghan replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to follow up with why, but that, if that\u2019s the assumption you\u2019re making, I think that feels like a pretty safe one, which was really hard to understand, right?\u201d Meghan declined to comment who spoke with Harry about the subject, telling Winfrey, \u201cI think that would be very damaging to them.\u201d Harry also declined, saying, \u201cI\u2019m never going to share [details of the conversation]. But at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked.\u201d He also said the topic was brought up early in his romance with Meghan, telling Winfrey, \u201cThat was right at the beginning, \u2018What will the kids look like?'\u201d \u201cThere were some real obvious signs before we even got married that this was going to be really hard,\u201d said Harry. 5. Harry says Prince Charles stopped taking his calls Harry claimed to Winfrey that his father, Prince Charles, stopped accepting his calls when Harry and Meghan were on an extended stay in Canada in late 2019 and planning their exit from their senior royal roles. \u201cWhen we were in Canada, I had three conversations with my grandmother and two conversations with my father, before he stopped taking my calls, and then said, \u2018Can you put this all in writing, what your plan is?,'\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe asked me to put it in writing, and I put all the specifics in there, even the fact that we were planning on putting the announcement out on the 7th of January.\u201d When asked by Winfrey why his father stopped taking his calls, Harry replied, \u201cBecause I took matters in, by that point, I took matters into my own hands. It was like, I need to do this for my family. This is not a surprise to anybody. It\u2019s really sad that it\u2019s got to this point, but I\u2019ve got to do something for my own mental health, for my wife\u2019s and for Archie\u2019s as well because I could see where this was headed.\u201d Harry said today he still feels \u201creally let down\u201d by his father. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to work through there, you know?,\u201d he said of their relationship. \u201cI feel really let down because he\u2019s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like, and Archie\u2019s his grandson. But at the same time, you know, of course, I will always love him.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of hurt that\u2019s happened, and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship,\u201d Harry added. \u201cBut they only know what they know \u2026 or what they\u2019re told, and I\u2019ve tried to educate them through the process that I have been educated.\u201d Speaking of his relationship with his older brother Prince William, Harry said, \u201cI love William to bits. He\u2019s my brother. We\u2019ve been through hell together, and we have a shared experience. But we were on different paths.\u201d 6. Meghan viewed tabloid reports of her relationship with Duchess Kate as a \u2018turning point\u2019 Several months after Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding, tabloid reports emerged alleging that Meghan made her sister-in-law Duchess Kate cry over dresses for the wedding\u2019s flower girls, of which Kate\u2019s daughter, Princess Charlotte, was one. Those tabloid reports, and the palace\u2019s apparent failure to correct the record, are what Meghan now describes as a \u201cturning point\u201d and a time \u201cwhen everything changed.\u201d When asked by Winfrey if she made Kate cry, as reported, Meghan replied, \u201cNo. No. The reverse happened, and I don\u2019t say that to be disparaging to anyone because it was a really hard week of the wedding and she was upset about something, but she owned it and she apologized and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing. And she did what I would do if I knew that I hurt someone, right, to just take accountability for it.\u201d \u201cWhat was shocking was, what was that, six, seven months after our wedding that the reverse of that would be out in the world,\u201d said Meghan. \u201cI would\u2019ve never wanted that to come out about her ever, even though it had happened. I protected that from ever being out in the world.\u201d Meghan claims people who were willing to go on the record to say that she did not make Kate cry were told not to by the royal communications team, and added of Kate, \u201cAnd maybe in the same way that the palace wouldn\u2019t let anybody else negate it, they wouldn\u2019t let her, because she\u2019s a good person.\u201d But Meghan said she saw the incident as the \u201cbeginning of a real character assassination.\u201d \u201cThey would go on the record and negate the most ridiculous story for anyone, right? I\u2019m talking about things that are super artificial and inconsequential,\u201d she said of the royal communications\u2019 team. \u201cBut the narrative about, you know, making Kate cry, I think was the beginning of a real character assassination. They knew it wasn\u2019t true, and I thought, \u201cWell, if they\u2019re not going to kill things like that, then what are we going to do?'\u201d 7. Harry, Meghan still have a close bond with Queen Elizabeth Though Prince Harry told Winfrey a \u201clack of support\u201d and \u201clack of understanding\u201d led to his and Meghan\u2019s rocky departure from their royal roles, he still holds a great fondness for his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken more to my grandmother in the last year than I have done for many, many years,\u201d said Harry, revealing he and Meghan and Archie have video calls with the queen. \u201cMy grandmother and I have a really good relationship and an understanding, and I have a deep respect for her. She\u2019s my commander-in-chief, right? She always will be.\u201d Harry also said the queen has been \u201camazing throughout\u201d his relationship with Meghan, a sentiment echoed by Meghan, who said the queen was one of the first family members she met in her relationship with Harry. \u201cThe Queen, for example, has always been wonderful to me,\u201d said Meghan, while describing the difference between the royal family and the royal institution. \u201cI mean, we had one of our first joint engagements together. She asked me to join her.\u201d \u201cI just really loved being in her company,\u201d said Meghan, who added the queen gave her pearl earrings and a matching necklace for their June 2018 joint engagement. \u201cAnd I remember we were in the car \u2026 going between engagements and she has a blanket that sits across her knees for warmth, and it was chilly and she was like, \u2018Meghan, come on,\u2019 and put it over my knees as well.\u201d \u201cIt made me think of my grandmother, where she\u2019s always been warm and inviting and really welcoming,\u201d said Meghan. Meghan also told Winfrey that when she learned Prince Philip had been hospitalized last month, she called Queen Elizabeth directly. \u201cI just picked up the phone and I called the queen, just to check in. You call. That\u2019s what we do,\u201d she said, adding of her newfound freedom with Harry, \u201cIt\u2019s like being able to default to not having to every moment go, \u2018Is that appropriate?\u2019\u201d 8. Harry, Meghan are having a baby girl Amid heavy revelations of mental health struggles and family tension, Prince Harry and Meghan shared some happy news in their conversation with Winfrey, that the child they are expecting is a girl. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d Harry told Winfrey, after Meghan waited for him to join the interview so they could share the news together. \u201cAmazing. Just grateful,\u201d Harry said of his own reaction. \u201cTo have any child, any one or any two, would have been amazing, but to have a boy and then a girl, I mean, what more can you ask for?\u201d \u201cNow we\u2019ve got our family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got, you know, the four of us and our two dogs.\u201d Harry and Meghan confirmed that Meghan is due to give birth this summer and said they don\u2019t plan to have any more children after her arrival, saying, \u201cTwo is it.\u201d Harry and Meghan first revealed they are expecting their second child on Valentine\u2019s Day, less than three months after Meghan opened up in a New York Times op-ed about a pregnancy loss the couple suffered last summer.

            "text": "  Today, The Royal Gazette embarks on a series examining some of the most far-reaching set of education changes in half a century. Overall, the reforms envisioned by the Ministry of Education propose to revamp the system for every child from the age of 4 to the age of 18. Only tertiary education is left alone. This week\u2019s series looks only at primary schools, the subject of the first consultation by the ministry. Under the proposed changes, Bermuda would move from a system of small neighbourhood primary schools, many with long histories, to a system of single-parish primary schools, each capable of accommodating up to 300 students and including a preschool on the premises for four-year-olds. The idea is that larger parish schools would have similar facilities and presumably would benefit from economies of scale, particularly for the teaching of subjects outside of \u201cthe core\u201d \u2014 art, music, physical education and so on. There would also be more scope for helping children with learning and behavioural problems. At the same time, the ministry and its reform teams are rethinking everything from curriculum to approaches to teaching as part of a system-wide reform. Inevitably, the focus of debate has been on the closures of nine, or half of the island\u2019s primary schools. This is not the first time the ministry has attempted to close primary schools. There have been failed efforts for two decades, all of which were sunk by waves of public opposition. There are good reasons to close some schools. Some have very small enrolments \u2014 fewer than 70 in one case and often fewer than 100. This is a waste of resources in administrative terms and where teacher-student ratios are well below the maximum of 15 students per class. The reasons for this are twofold. The population has been declining for years because of a falling birthrate and emigration since the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, there are fewer five-year-olds entering Primary 1. At the same time, lack of confidence in the public-school system has been endemic, meaning that while enrolments at public schools have slumped, the decline in private schools has been less marked and there has also been an increase in home or alternative schooling. Historically, and it is worth noting that when the Progressive Labour Party returned to power in 2017 \u2014 and was re-elected in 2020 \u2014 there was no promise of primary school reform, it has been assumed that primary schools did a decent job, and problems arose in the middle schools and secondary schools. But there has been a precipitous decline in primary-school performance since 2012. Where English and science averaged a shade over 3.5 in Cambridge checkpoint examinations in 2012 \u2014 generally considered to be \u201cgood\u201d, the third level below excellent or very good \u2014 the average fell to just barely 3.0 by 2018 and dropped below that level in 2019. Mathematics, always weak, was measured at 2.9 in 2012 (at the top end of \u201cOK\u201d) and slumped to 2.0 by 2018 (barely OK) and to 1.75 (poor) in 2019. So the problem is real. The question, as ever, is what to do about it. Does the crisis justify the scale of changes envisioned by the education ministry and, if sweeping reform is needed, are these the right reforms? The truth is that no one really knows the answers to those questions, but the ministry is putting the cart before the horse by seemingly focusing on buildings first and teaching second. What is missing from the consultation document is a hard look at why standards have dropped so much. There is a suggestion that the Cambridge curriculum is the wrong one for Bermuda. In the words of the consultation report, it is \u201cmisaligned, antiquated and has limited offerings\u201d. There is an acknowledgement of sorts that teaching standards are inadequate because there is, rightly, a great deal promised in terms of improving teaching. But unlike the Hopkins Report, full of never-implemented good ideas from a decade ago, the consultation document does not look at those parts of the system that are working. Thus, as The Royal Gazette\u2019s  reporting shows today, two of the three best-performing primary schools will be closed under the proposed reforms, while the school that performs least well in that particular parish will remain open. In response, the ministry has argued that the physical location of the school has little to do with its performance. This may be right, but begs another question: why then is the criteria for school closure based entirely on location and physical standards? The former principal of St George\u2019s Prep, consistently the best primary school in Bermuda for decades, has stated that the reason it is successful is because the school is able to select its own staff. As an aided school, it also has the final say in selecting its own principal. Diallo Rabain, the Minister of Education, has left open the possibility that the new primary schools will have more autonomy. But these plans are vague, and the idea that schools should be able to recruit their own teachers \u2014 commonplace in the private sector \u2014 is anathema to many in education because it would set off competition among schools for the best teachers. So rather than tackling the key question of why standards have declined so much in so short a time, the Ministry of Education has fallen back on the hope that improved and more equitable facilities will reverse the decline. This is exactly the same argument that was made about 30 years ago when the last major education restructuring took place \u2014 the one this one seeks to effectively reverse. Then, improved facilities in middle schools and two new senior secondary schools were going to solve the problems in secondary education. One of the many former education ministers, Terry Lister, who inherited the upheaval caused by the restructuring, later said words to the effect that it had been learnt that bricks and mortar were not enough. And yet, 20 years later, with most of the people involved in that mostly failed effort off the stage, Bermuda seems set to make the same mistakes again. On Friday, the consultation period for primary-school restructuring comes to an end. People who care about education should make sure their voices are heard before final decisions are made.

            "text": " \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t  \nFebruary 13, 2015\n  Share With trade links between Argentina and China now firmly established, President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner visited counterpart Xi Jinping last week and signed a raft of agreements. However, with the partnership\u2019s flagship project subject to an environmental dispute that must now be resolved by the Supreme Court, the next steps are set to be anything but straightforward. Named after Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s late husband, former president N\u00e9stor Kirchner and the former governor of Santa Cruz province Jorge Cepernic, two new dams set to be constructed will be among Argentina\u2019s most important energy projects, helping reduce the quantity of energy that is imported in an economy where dollars are scarce. Yet at the same time, environmental experts and campaign groups claim the dams have the potential to affect three Patagonian glaciers at UNESCO World Heritage site Los Glaciares. The project has a price tag of USD\u00a0$4.7\u00a0billion, will run for five years and is fully financed by Chinese banks, with part of the energy generated used to repay the loan. The first tranche of USD\u00a0$288\u00a0million has already been received, with the remainder to be provided in regular instalments. Part of the money will stay in China for investment in machinery, with the remainder destined for Argentina. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive project with significant involvement from Argentine companies. Turbines, machinery and technical expertise will be provided by China; the rest will be up to Argentina. It will be a major source of employment and will increase consumption in the region by increasing the consumption of the workers,\u201d explains Ernesto Fern\u00e1ndez Taboada, executive director of the Argentine\u2013Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Even though the construction order for the project has already been signed by Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and Xi Jinping, the main work will not begin until October at the earliest, when the environmental impact study is due for completion, according to sources from the construction companies involved. But this doesn\u2019t mean the project won\u2019t get under way until then: partial permits have already been awarded and the construction of roads, bridges, workshops and houses will begin soon. \u201cWe won\u2019t start the project itself until approval of the environmental impact study, which we began last September and should be ready in October. We\u2019re taking a whole year to study the behaviour of the river and the surrounding nature. However, partial approvals have already been granted for subsidiary works,\u201d states Mariano Musso, Head of Institutional Relations at Electroingener\u00eda, one of the companies involved in the project. But it seems the company\u2019s guarantees are not enough for environmental experts and organisations, who have lodged an appeal with Argentina\u2019s Supreme Court, demanding construction be fully halted until completion of the environmental impact study. The court has yet to rule on the case but is expected to do so in a matter of days. \u201cUnder the National Constitution, work cannot start without the environmental impact study. We\u2019re not saying the project should not go ahead, we\u2019re asking for the correct studies to be carried out to legally determine whether it can proceed. Without this study, the two dams will be illegal,\u201d warned Luj\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Terrone, Executive Director of the Patagonian Association of Environmentalist Lawyers. \u00a0 A Project Dating Back 60 Years The hydroelectric complex will be built in the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz and will see the first dams built on the River Santa Cruz. A consortium of three companies will be responsible for its construction: Electroingener\u00eda and Hidrocuyo (both Argentine), and Gezhouba Group (China), the latter with a long history of building dams, including China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam, the largest in the world, but whose environmental impact has also made it one of the most controversial. The project dates back to the 1950s and its feasibility was studied in the 1970s under Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship, however it has remained on the drawing board until now. In 2007, it was relaunched by the Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner government, with the names Condor Cliff and La Barrancosa proposed for the dams (subsequently renamed N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic) at a cost of 35% less than the current figure. However it stalled due to a lack of funding. The dams will increase the country\u2019s energy capacity by 5% and its hydroelectric capacity by 15%, creating 5,000 jobs as part of the construction. Around 150 Chinese engineers and managers will be based in Argentina, with the rest of the team comprising local workers, as guaranteed by the construction companies. Around fifty ranches (47,000 hectares) will be flooded as part of the construction and the dams will house 11 turbines providing an annual generating capacity of 5,000 GWh and 1,740 MW of power. However, the project will also require the installation of a new high-voltage power transmission line since the existing infrastructure will only be able to carry 45% of the energy generated by the dams. Experts have questioned the economic feasibility of this second line since as the dams operate based on energy peaks, it will only be used 4% of the time. However, Electroningener\u00eda is still confident the second line could be built at the same time as the dams and could also be used for future energy projects in Patagonia, such as wind farms. \u00a0 Glaciers and Environmental Concerns The insistence about the environmental impact study arises from concerns about the consequences of the project on the Upsala, Spegazzini and Perito Moreno glaciers in the UNESCO-protected Los Glaciares national park. Experts claim the maximum level of the Kirchner dam, at the same average level of the Argentino Lake, is unsuitable, increasing the level of the lake and causing tides that will erode the front of the Perito Moreno glacier and stop the traditional blocks of ice breaking off, a phenomenon that attracts thousands of tourists. The controversy is not without precedent. Across the border in Chile, also in Patagonia, the HidroAys\u00e9n project would have resulted in the construction of five hydroelectric power plants, two on the River Baker and three on the River Pascua. However, fierce criticism from environmental groups and indigenous communities resulted in a council of ministers rejecting the project last year. \u201cThe dam will be fed from the lake, whose level will rise and fall to meet Buenos Aires' energy requirements and consumption. The glacier will not be immune to variations and their erosive effects,\u201d argues Gerardo Bartolom\u00e9, the engineer at the head of an online petition aiming to ensure the correct environmental studies are carried out for the dams. Similarly, Juan Pablo Milana, a glaciologist and researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), believes the dams will cause irreversible damage to the Spegazzini and Upsala glaciers. \u201cThe glaciers are already subject to the forces of nature and introducing further changes is complicated. Increasing the level of the Argentino Lake will create a flotation effect. Lower water pressure at the base of the glacier will not only cause detachment of ice but will also change the way it breaks off,\u201d explains Milana. Electroingener\u00eda dismisses the potential impacts with the assurance that operation of the dams will be regulated and controlled by the basin authority. The N\u00e9stor Kirchner reservoir will also accompany variations in the lake, allowing more efficient regulation. \u201cThe construction of the dams will have absolutely no effect on the lake and the glaciers. The project would not have been tendered if there was a real risk. Our company respects the environment and this is one of our priorities. The glacier has World Heritage status and no company would be willing to cause problems,\u201d assures Musso. \n            You can republish our articles for free under the Creative Commons licence.\n           \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Impacts and innovations in a key sector for China and Latin America  Mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to cleaner economies   Natural resources and responsible extraction   Bridging Latin America's infrastructure gap sustainably   The drivers, actors and institutions behind the billions  A chinadialogue partner site.\nFind out more\n Dialogo Chino uses cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

Foto: Archivo / Vicente Costales / EL COMERCIO Los trabajos en la central hidroel\u00e9ctrica Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n afrontan un nuevo desaf\u00edo. Un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de que se retomaron las obras para concluir con este proyecto, que lleva 12 a\u00f1os desde que se coloc\u00f3 la primera piedra, el suministro de los equipos y la llegada de los t\u00e9cnicos internacionales se han visto afectados a causa de la pandemia de covid-19. La provisi\u00f3n de los equipos electromec\u00e1nicos, que comprenden turbinas, generadores, compuertas, v\u00e1lvulas y otros que se requieren para esta hidroel\u00e9ctrica, se ha visto limitado, porque los distintos fabricantes se encuentran en Europa y Asia, inform\u00f3 a inicios de este mes la Corporaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador (Celec).  Las condiciones que a\u00fan se mantienen en la movilidad a escala mundial, han incidido tambi\u00e9n en la llegada del personal extranjero, encargado de ejecutar la supervisi\u00f3n puntual y especializada del montaje de los equipos. Para el arribo de estos t\u00e9cnicos, la Celec ha realizado coordinaciones para cumplir con este prop\u00f3sito.  Internamente, a causa de la crisis sanitaria, se ha tenido tambi\u00e9n que superar las restricciones que han debido afrontar las empresas locales que prestan sus servicios a este proyecto. Ha influido tambi\u00e9n la capacidad limitada en las instalaciones de los campamentos para garantizar el aislamiento del personal, agreg\u00f3 la Celec  Ante estas condiciones, la empresa rusa Tyazhmash, encargada de concluir las intervenciones pendientes y poner en marcha esta planta de generaci\u00f3n, ha priorizado las actividades que se deben cumplir.  Con esto se ha buscado garantizar continuidad de los trabajos de montaje de los equipos, en funci\u00f3n de la provisi\u00f3n disponible hasta la fecha, precis\u00f3 la Celec.  Parte de los equipos de este proyecto fueron instalados por la firma rusa Inter Rao, pero esta dej\u00f3 el proyecto tras la terminaci\u00f3n unilateral del contrato por parte del Gobierno, en marzo del 2017. Por este asunto, esta empresa mantiene un litigio con Ecuador.  Cuando se retomaron los trabajos en junio pasado, la nueva firma a cargo del proyecto realiz\u00f3 primero la recuperaci\u00f3n de los equipos que fueron instalados y que permanecieron sin mantenimiento cerca de tres a\u00f1os. Lo propio se realiz\u00f3 con los equipos que estuvieron embodegados, entre otras intervenciones.  Esto ha permitido, que en este periodo la obra registre un avance global del 88,1%, previo a la firma del contrato con Tyazhmash el proyecto ten\u00eda un desarrollo total del 85,4%.  El avance alcanzado en este periodo se podr\u00eda atribuir al estado en el que se encontraban los equipos, las limitaciones que ha implicado la crisis sanitaria desde marzo pasado o aspectos propios de este proyecto, refiri\u00f3 seg\u00fan Ricardo Buitr\u00f3n, consultor en proyectos hidroel\u00e9ctricos.  Ante esto, Buitr\u00f3n expres\u00f3 que la empresa deber\u00e1 acelerar los tiempos para cumplir con el contrato, que vencer\u00e1 en septiembre del 2021.  El Gobierno tiene previsto que la construcci\u00f3n de las obras pendientes de esta hidroel\u00e9ctrica concluya en el segundo semestre del 2021. Para estas intervenciones que debe desarrollar Tyazhmash se destinar\u00e1n USD 130 millones, entre equipamiento y obras civiles complementarias.  Este monto se sumar\u00e1 a los USD 735 millones asignados para esta central, desde que se coloc\u00f3 la primera piedra en esta obra en 2008, seg\u00fan inform\u00f3 el Ministerio de Energ\u00eda y Recursos Naturales no Renovables, cuando se firm\u00f3 el contrato para retomar los trabajos en Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n.  El costo referencial de esta hidroel\u00e9ctrica, en un inicio, fue de USD 370,9 millones. Esto incluye obra civil, instalaci\u00f3n de equipos y fiscalizaci\u00f3n.  Cuando esta obra concluya, la hidroel\u00e9ctrica Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n estar\u00e1 en la capacidad para generar 254,4 megavatios (MW) de energ\u00eda. Esto incluye Sarapullo, Alluriqu\u00edn y una minicentral de 1,4 MW.  Esto es casi la sexta parte de la potencia que tiene la central m\u00e1s grande del pa\u00eds, Coca Codo Sinclair, que tiene 1 500 MW. As\u00ed, Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n aportar\u00e1 con 1 100 gigavatios (GW) hora media al a\u00f1o. Cronolog\u00eda Enero del 2008  El expresidente Rafael Correa y el Prefecto de Pichincha, Gustavo Baroja, colocaron la primera piedra para la construcci\u00f3n de la central Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n.  Septiembre del 2008  El Gobierno expuls\u00f3 a Odebrecht, que estaba a cargo de esta obra, por las fallas identificadas en la central hidroel\u00e9ctrica San Francisco, tambi\u00e9n al frente de la brasile\u00f1a.  Noviembre del 2010  El Gobierno, a trav\u00e9s de la Corporaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador (Celec), adjudic\u00f3 a la empresa china CWE la ejecuci\u00f3n de la obra civil.   Diciembre del 2010  Para la instalaci\u00f3n y puesta en marcha de los equipos electromec\u00e1nicos se contrat\u00f3 a la firma rusa Inter Rao.  Diciembre del 2016  El expresidente Rafael Correa orden\u00f3 dar por terminado el contrato con Inter Rao, por supuestos incumplimientos.  Marzo del 2017  Inter Rao dej\u00f3 la obra tras la terminaci\u00f3n unilateral del contrato. Este proceso incluy\u00f3 la calificaci\u00f3n de empresa incumplida en el registro de proveedores. Mayo del 2018  En Mosc\u00fa se conform\u00f3 una comisi\u00f3n intergubernamental ruso-ecuatoriana para buscar un acuerdo y permitir que Inter Rao retome las obras en esta central hidroel\u00e9ctrica.  Septiembre del 2018  La fiscalizadora Consorcio Pilat\u00f3n-Toachi sali\u00f3 de este proyecto, debido a que resultaba imposible fiscalizar esta obra, luego de que se fren\u00f3 la ins\u00adtalaci\u00f3n de los equipos electromec\u00e1nicos.   Diciembre 2018  Inter Rao inici\u00f3 un arbitraje internacional en contra de la Celec, a cargo de la ejecuci\u00f3n de Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n. Este recurso fue presentado en el centro de arbitraje y mediaci\u00f3n de la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Santiago de Chile. Febrero del 2019 El Ministerio de Energ\u00eda y Recursos Naturales no Renovables anunci\u00f3 que este proyecto ser\u00e1 declarado en emergencia para retomar los trabajos. Esto permitir\u00e1 contratar de manera directa a la empresa rusa Tyazhmash para que termine de instalar los equipos electromec\u00e1nicos pendientes.  Mayo del 2019  El Ministerio de Energ\u00eda firm\u00f3 un contrato con la empresa rusa Tyazhmash para que se termine de instalar los equipos electromec\u00e1nicos pendientes y las obras civiles complementarias. \u00a9 Derechos reservados 2020 Grupo EL COMERCIO Queda prohibida la reproducci\u00f3n total o\n                                parcial, por\n                                cualquier medio, de todos los contenidos sin autorizaci\u00f3n expresa de Grupo EL COMERCIO\n                                T\u00e9rminos y\n                                Condiciones."

While Prime Minister Patrick Manning last week praised the NAPA as being \u201cworld class,\u201d Victor yesterday begged to differ, saying the facility is plagued with technical problems and argued that it does not compare in any form with Queen\u2019s Hall, St Ann\u2019s.\n\nDiscussing a dossier on the NAPA prepared by the ACTT which has been circulating on the internet this month, Victor, a multi-media artist, said, \u201c$80 million is a realistic estimate of the costs that would be involved to correct the defects.\u201d \u201cIt appears as though the firm which built and designed the facility (Shanghai Construction Group) may not have been experienced in building facilities of this kind,\u201d he said. The ACTT in their dossier, entitled, \u201cThe Tragedy and Hidden History of the NAPA\u201d, the coalition of artists also estimate that maintenance of the building like the NAPA, which has an estimated budget of about $500 million, can approach as much as ten per cent of building cost. Architects, though, noted that maintenance costs are difficult to estimate due to the variables involved, such as the quality of original materials used. Among the defects noted in the ACTT dossier are: There is no loading area for the main stage; The stage is \u201cill-matched\u201d to the 1,500 seating capacity of the hall; The orchestra pit is defective; The light and sound boards are analogue and not digital (the industry standard for the last decade); There are \u201chundreds of problems with lighting and sound fixtures and equipment\u201d The stage floor is \u201cribbed and is not a sprung floor so is ill-suited for dancing and thus will damage dancers\u201d. Dance studios are flawed; There are \u201cno costume rooms, no set construction rooms and no warehousing rooms\u201d; One architect not involved in the ACTT report, who has been inside the NAPA yesterday confirmed the flaws identified in the report and added, \u201cthe floors are laminated and they have begun to chip already. Because of materials used, there are also creases on the stage, which will be a challenge for dancer.\u201d \u201cA loading area\u2019s dimensions are normally about 16 feet x 10 feet- NAPA has a normal door! This means that sets, costumes of a certain size, certain musical instruments (hint- one of them is our national one) cannot fit through NAPA\u2019s doors to get backstage!\u201d the report, compiled from a site visit and other sources, notes. \u201cThe two rooms that have been trumpeted as the two smaller theatres are in fact just two rooms. Flat rooms with no seats. It would cost tens of millions of dollars to convert these rooms into theatres.\u201d \u201cAll the light and sound boards are analogue not digital. They are also mid-standard and not high-end,\u201d the report continues. \u201cMost of the fixtures are completely wrong: There are literally hundreds of problems with lighting and sound fixtures and equipment. Some may sound small to laypeople but they mean everything to the technicians entrusted to make sure shows go on.\u201d \u201cFor instance: the bars that the hundreds of light fixtures are on are square and not round. This means that lights can only be pointed in four directions (two of them up to the roof!) and not in gradated choice as on a round bar.\u201d Tellingly, signage for technical parts of the building is in Chinese, an indication that the design\u2014heavily trumped as being inspired by the Chaconia flower\u2014may not have been original to Trinidad and Tobago. Additionally, \u201cThere are no dressing rooms within reach of the backstage, and no clothing racks, showers and a host of other amenities in the dressing rooms that do exist. This probably can be rectified but it will cost.\u201d \u201cThere are no monitors for backstage and for the stage manager. This probably too can be rectified \u2014 but it will cost.\u201d \u201cThe stage-floor is ribbed and is not a sprung floor so is ill-suited for dancing and thus will damage dancers. Theatrical floors are \u2018rigged\u2019 so that dancers can dance on then \u2014 they have a bounce to absorb and cushion dancers \u2014 otherwise it\u2019s like you are dancing on concrete.\u201d \u201cThe dance studios are completely unsuited for dance. The dance-rooms have concrete and terrazzo floors; have dance bars too high; and have mirrors on both walls creating a circus infinite-mirror effect. This means there are effectively no dance studio spaces in NAPA. New properly constructed dance floors will have to be built, one mirrored wall will have to come down and all the dance bars taken down and re-hung. To add to the litany of complaints, \u201cthere are no costume rooms, no set construction rooms and no warehousing rooms.\u201d Members of the ACTT include Fabien Alphonso, president of the Recording Industry Association of Trinidad and Tobago (RIATT) and Andre Reyes, president of the Artist Teachers Association. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it could be that the firm that got the contract has a competency in building a performing arts centre,\u201d Victor, who appeared before the Uff Commission of Inquiry into Udecott, the state corporation that built the facility, said. \u201cThis is a tragedy of an immense proportion.\u201d President of the Joint Consultative Council of the local construction industry Winston Riley yesterday noted that aside from functional problems, there have been concerns about the construction materials used for the project. \u201cThere are serious concerns about it as an academy,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut we have been concerned about the use of mild steel in the building which we believe would put the building under risk.\u201d The NAPA was reportedly built pursuant to a Government to Government agreement between Trinidad and Tobago and China, at an estimated budget of about $500 million. There was no competitive tender for the project which was handed to the Shanghai Construction Group, the same company that built the Prime Minister\u2019s Residence and Diplomatic Centre. Efforts to contact SCG were unsuccessful. When Manning, who had come under fire for his constant defence of Udecott in the face of compelling evidence of corruption at the state enterprise, opened the building last November, he called it, \u201ca masterpiece owned by the people of Trinidad and Tobago.\u201d At a press briefing last week in London for Commonwealth observances, Manning, the chairman of the Commonwealth, noted that the opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) took place at NAPA. \u201cAll in all my dear friends, I think that we were pleased with the outcome. Of course, we were able to expose to the international community a new facility in Port-of-Spain: a National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) which as everybody saw, we believe is acknowledged to be a world class facility in a small developing country, seeking and striving to take its place among the great countries of the world,\u201d Manning said. Udecott has blocked attempts to have an open media tour of the project. \u201cTaxpayers are going to have to live with this,\u201d Victor said yesterday. http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,117279.html It\u2019s scandalous\n\u201cIT\u2019S scandalous! A monumental waste of public funds,\u201d was how Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar yesterday described the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) in Port-of-Spain. She also expressed disgust over the revelation, as reported in yesterday\u2019s edition of Newsday, that an estimated $80 million would be needed to correct major flaws at the academy as pointed out by president of the Artists Coalition of Trinidad and Tobago (ACTT) Rubadri Victor, in a dossier entitled \u201cThe Tragedy and Hidden History of the NAPA\u201d. Once again the Opposition is reacting to a \u201cfait accompli\u201d situation rather than being proactive before the construction of the Performing Arts center.\nThe Opposition should be leading rather than jumping on the bandwagon and taking thier cues from informed artisan critics.We blame the government at every opportunity, but one of the major problems in T&T is an ineffective Opposition, acting as informed watchdogs. To think that some would say that I should have given up on the likes of a past  intransigent , non objective thinker such as T-Man. I knew that they were wrong ,and my Granny the wise one was correct when she echoed the well tested viewpoint  that, \u201cPerseverance is the key to success.\u201d\n It took the good fellow close to two years to appreciate what I and a few astute political observers  were trying to tell him and enamored tribalistic party fans. In a democracy , a government can be only as ineffective , and useless , if they are allowed so to be by the current Opposition of the day.\n It is clear even for the visually impaired to see ,that our  Opposition under the stewardship of Basdeo Panday   has done a disservice to this country , in not first holding the respective governments accountable where necessary, but secondly attempting to be an exemplary \u2018government in waiting,\u2019 ready to fill the void with useful broad based ,policy ideas ,when the opportunity presents itself.\n They have failed in that they misunderstood one of the most important tenets in politics , as  expected of them by a very savvy voting public.\n   This is that your job is not simply to opposed for the sake of opposition every policy put forth by the government-even those with merits , that could be beneficial for the nation. Since in their case they were  no longer a mere Trade Union Pressure group , but a political party vying to rule the entire country, they were expected to not only concentrate on narrow constituency political affairs, but occasionally those that can aid in the full growth and development of all our peoples ,and the  nation.\n \u201cEvery creed and race finds and equal place ,\u201d is not a catch phrase slogan for Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, ML King, or some Nobel Peace Prize advocate, but part of our national anthem, which must be  practiced in and out of power \u2013 in thoughts words ,deeds and action if the wish is to   differentiate oneself from the encroaching arrogance by the cocky  PNM  leadership ,and their over confident , well oiled , fat cat agents.\n    Our often sleeping populace , with few exception , as voters could see clearly through most  country hating behaviors , and so won\u2019t extend rewards via  the polls.\n   In addition salt is added to injuries ,when voters are  repeatedly chastised , as being  naive party hacks , and self haters , for daring to give fresh mandates to the PNM , each time they ignore transparently shallow political overtures, and conveniently created marriages of convenience. Such actions can best be characterized as not only ludicrous , but politically suicidal as was repeatedly proven.\n   It is only gullible idiots that just landed from Mars that could believe or subscribe to the preposterous accusations that the PNM  has only won power ,in due part to electoral corruption-unless one is saying that 1986, 1995 and 2000, when they lost, were  aberrations , or mere  figment of our collective imaginations.\n It is therefore  insulting to  the intelligence of our people to  resort to  this and similar childish , ungracious \u2018sour grapes,\u2019 ploys.\n  I am extremely skeptical , but fairly optimistic,  that  Madame Kamela  has what it takes to lead this Opposition party in a different direction \u2013 from which it was stuck for decades-which can eventually lead to some modicum of  success for her and party ,as well as in the long run , the nation as a whole.\nIt is safe to say that we deserves no less.  The socially progressives are observing Madame K.We are prepared to extend the olive branch to one of your loyal advisors T-Man, but promise to closely \u2018examine his horns,\u2019and would not hesitate to crush  him like a Brazilian Anaconda , if he becomes a procrastinating thorn in our flesh.\n Here me out, and be forewarned :-\u2018If you\u2019ve always done, what you\u2019ve always done, then you\u2019ll always get , what you\u2019ve always got.\u2019\nA word to the wise is sufficient, \u2018ehh\u2019 T-Man? Buying NAPA in bag\nThat Government could have proceeded to have the designs and construction done by strangers and aliens, and without a single input from the local Arts community brings bitter memories of the debacle of the Mount Hope Hospital, designed and built by French consortia without any reference to local needs, local expertise and local services and materials. And that was completed in 1986, just as the then PNM Government was going out of power, in the wake of a massive \u201cforeign-driven\u201d construction programme riddled with waste incompetence and corruption.  NAPA troubles President\nPRESIDENT George Maxwell Richards has expressed concern over reports of faulty facilities at the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) in Port-of-Spain and has gone so far as to hold a meeting with the Artists Coalition of Trinidad and Tobago (ACTT) on the issue, Newsday has learnt.  Stakeholders deny being consulted over arts academy\nCULTURAL stakeholders are challenging a statement made by Culture Minister Marlene McDonald that they were consulted during the construction of the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA). McDonald, during a news conference on Tuesday at the Ministry of Culture, St Ann\u2019s, listed 15 organisations which were consulted on the NAPA project. NAPA guards block Dookeran from tour\nSECURITY officers yesterday blocked a contingent of Congress of the People (COP) members from entering the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) in Port of Spain. \u2026Dookeran and team barred from NAPA No Chutney for NAPA\nCULTURE Minister Marlene Mc Donald blanked a proposal for the hosting of the World Chutney Soca Monarch at the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) in Port-of- Spain because the facility was \u2013 in her view \u2013 not built for \u201cthose kinds of things\u201d, according to president of the National Chutney Foundation, Vijay Ramlal. Insensitive or arrogant?\nWhy has Government, even with the controversy surrounding its arbitrary award of multi-million dollar construction contracts, gone ahead and entered into an arrangement with the Chinese Government for the erection of the National Carnival Centre by the Shanghai Construction Group (SCG)? NAPA a \u2018cat-in-bag\u2019 deal\nRubadiri Victor emerged into national focus a week ago, after Artists Coalition of T&T, which he heads, claimed there were design and construction flaws at the costly National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA). Victor is a long-time practitioner and advocate of the arts. He discussed NAPA and the arts, generally, in a wide-ranging interview. Let\u2019s have open tour of Napa\nIn the wake of an aggressive refutation by the Minister of Culture of his accusations of inappropriateness in construction of the National Academy of Performing Arts, activist Rubadiri Victor has circulated a new document alleging the many failures of consultation on the way to the theatrical facility Trinidad and Tobago has today. Verily, verily, I say unto you\nThank Minister of Culture Marlene McDonald for the title of this week\u2019s column. There it was in Newsday, March 17, Marlene McDonald impressing on us that the National Academy for the Performing Arts was \u201ca fantastic facility\u201d and that \u201c\u2026 the interim president of the Artists Coalition of Trinidad and Tobago, (Rubadiri Victor) had, along with persons known to have political aspirations, sought to derail the construction of the facility even prior to the start of construction.\u201d Enemies again. They are all over the place. Poor Mr Victor. He simply has the wrong friends. Mac Farlane: \u2018Tweaking\u2019 still needed at NAPA\nReigning Carnival bandleader Brian Mac Farlane says the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) is \u201cfabulous,\u201d but he admits there were some issues to be addressed like the door and flooring.  Stop the South Academy\nARTISTS yesterday literally begged the State to reverse a trend of non-consultation over the controversial Academy for the Performing Arts, as they wrote Prime Minister Patrick Manning calling on him to stop work on the South Academy for the Performing Arts (SAPA). Ramlal rebuts Ravi B on NAPA\nPRESIDENT of the National Chutney Foundation Vijay Ramlal has presented proof that his request to host the World Chutney Soca Monarch at the National Performing Arts (NAPA) was denied by Culture Minister Marlene McDonald. Only media for today\u2019s tour\nVel Lewis, deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Culture, says only media personnel will be taken on a tour of the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) at Princes Building Grounds, Port-of-Spain, today. Regrello: $20m to fix NAPA flaws\nJunia Regrello, Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs says it will cost about $20 million to attend to the niggling issues like lighting and flooring at the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA), Princes Building Grounds, Port-of-Spain. Regrello came forward yesterday in his capacity as both performer and member of government. Along with recently appointed Sharon Christopher, chair of the management committee of the auditorium, Regrello admitted to flaws that need to be addressed. NAPA flaws \u2018to be fixed\u2019\nThe media yesterday observed certain flaws in need of fine-tuning, and possibly repair or replacement, at the newly-built National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) in Port of Spain.  City Corp CEO: No approval for NAPA in South Comments are closed."

Sunday's demonstration was held to create awareness about the Chinese rule in Tibet among the general public around the world. The Tibetan Uprising Day is observed on March 10 every year to mark the 1959 armed rebellion against China in Tibet, which resulted in a violent crackdown of Tibetan people, forcing\u00a0the Dalai Lama to take shelter\u00a0in India.\u00a0 Read:\u00a0Dalai Lama Receives 1st Dose Of COVID-19 Vaccine In HP After Tibet Govt-in-exile's Request According to news agency ANI, protesters began their march from Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT Station in Taipei on Sunday, where they chanted slogans, such as \"Free Tibet, China Out\", \"Long Live Dalai Lama!\". Several mainstream politicians also took part in Sunday's rally, including Member of Parliament Hung Sun-han of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taipei City Councilor Miao Po-ya.

            "text": " (Reuters) \u2013     Here\u2019s what you need to know about the coronavirus right now: Japan\u2019s inoculations off to snail-pace start  Japan\u2019s COVID-19 inoculation campaign is moving at a glacial pace, hampered by a lack of supply and a shortage of speciality syringes that underscore the enormous challenge it faces in its aim to vaccinate every adult by the year\u2019s end. Since the campaign began three weeks ago, just under 46,500 doses had been administered to frontline medical workers as of Friday. At the current rate, it would take 126 years to vaccinate Japan\u2019s population of 126 million. By contrast, South Korea, which began its vaccinations a week later than Japan, had administered nearly seven times more shots as of Sunday. India\u2019s richest state has half of new, active cases India\u2019s richest state of Maharashtra accounts for more than half of both new and total active infections, health ministry data showed on Monday, although a team of experts said the state\u2019s current wave might be \u201cless virulent\u201d. Experts say India\u2019s relatively low hospitalisation and fatality rates suggest the pandemic is approaching its next phase of largely manageable local outbreaks, such as those being seen in the western industrialised state.  India\u2019s tally of 11.23 million infections is the world\u2019s highest after the United States, with the state accounting for 11,141 of the 18,599 new cases reported in the past 24 hours.  Fauci upbeat on vaccinations for U.S. teens by autumn High school students in the United States should be able to receive COVID-19 vaccinations by the autumn, with younger students likely to be cleared for vaccinations in early 2022, top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday. Fauci said he expected the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue relaxed guidelines for people who have already been vaccinated within \u201cthe next couple of days\u201d, but urged continued vigilance on mitigation measures for the more than 80% of Americans still awaiting shots. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the right direction. We just need to hang in there a bit longer,\u201d Fauci told CBS. Thailand to reduce quarantine for vaccinated travellers Thailand will from next month reduce its mandatory quarantine from 14 to seven days for foreigners arriving in the country who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, its Health Minister said on Monday. Vaccinations must be administered within three months of the travel period and visitors will still be required to show negative COVID-19 test results within three days of their departure, Anutin Charnvirankul told a news conference. Those not yet inoculated but with coronavirus-free certificates would be quarantined for 10 days. East Timor imposes first lockdown  The tiny Southeast Asian nation of East Timor will put its capital city on a lockdown for the first time, its government said on Monday, amid fears it could be facing its first local outbreak. A \u201csanitary fence and mandatory confinement\u201d will be imposed in Dili for seven days from midnight Monday with residents asked to stay home unless necessary to leave, the country\u2019s council of ministers said in statement. A former Portuguese colony with a population of 1.2 million, East Timor has detected just 122 cases, most of which were imported. \n  (Compiled by Linda Noakes; Editing by Alex Richardson) Subscribe Sign up for our daily news explosion."

            "text": " Their identity is secret for now, but revealing it could bring down the Monarchy, says Fleet Street Fox The most important part of any interview is what they don't tell you. When Prince Charles spoke to Jonathan Dimbleby and confessed adultery after his marriage breakdown, he didn't say who broke it. When Princess Diana spoke to Martin Bashir, she suggested the crown skip her ex because he didn't have the character for it, but she didn't say what his character was.  And when Prince Andrew spoke to Emily Maitlis, he said he didn't recall sleeping with an underage girl, but didn't say why he couldn't be certain.  Last night, when the Duchess of Sussex spoke to Oprah Winfrey, she refused to reveal who had wanted to know how brown her baby would be. And that, Dear Reader, is a bomb beneath the British throne.     Presumably, they were also concerned about the frizz of his hair, the breadth of his nose, or the colour of his eyes. But why did anyone care, when the nation wasn't bothered?  Meghan's mother Doria is not only black, but also has dreadlocks and a nose ring and teaches yoga, which are equally appalling to those who live in palaces. A bit of that in the young prince would not be a surprise, and could be an asset to a modern Monarchy striving to appear relevant in the 21st century.  It boils down to bloodlines, and the medieval idea that women are the equivalent of horses who must be broken, ridden, and bred. Ordinary women have always fared better than Royal ones, having access to midwives for example while Queens laboured to give birth as an ignorant man armed with leeches yelled instructions from the other side of a door. But it is a surprise anyone close to Harry and Meghan would have thought they wouldn't mind being treated like that. Whoever did it is fairly stupid, and feels more powerful than them.     This isn't some flunkey who asked the question, which according to Meghan was done repeatedly while she was pregnant, during discussions about Archie's future rights to security and titles. No Royal staffer would ask anything of a 'principal' without being invited, or unless ordered to by someone higher up the foodchain. Revealing the identity of who first asked the question, according to Meghan, would be \"very damaging to them\". And there are few Royals it could harm.  Prince Philip has a history of racist utterances and one more would be just another of Grandad's Gaffes. Prince Andrew, in hiding from an FBI investigation into child sex trafficking, arguably couldn't be any more damaged.   Princess Anne - well, difficult to keep working for Save the Children if it was her, but it's doubtful someone so brusque would ask repeatedly. A daft cousin, or a minor member of the family with a tendency to wear racist jewellery, might conceivably have said something rude once or twice.  But none of them would have been involved in a discussion about titles and police protection. That is handled by a handful of Royals and senior staff - those nearest to the throne.     So it's someone more powerful than Harry, and closer to the crown than him. Someone concerned about limiting the number of people who get police protection, and the future costs and size of the Royal Family. It is someone who feels their own position could be weakened, in some way, by a prince who looks a bit brown.  ITV Royal Correspondent Chris Ship says he's been told it's not the Queen or Prince Philip, but neither of them qualify on these points anyway. He says the only possibilities therefore are Harry's brother, his father, and their wives.  Camilla has no Royal children to defend the position of. Neither she nor Kate have a reputation for exploiting their power. But William and Charles do.

The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at 12noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.   Both were raised to be king. Both know that means everyone else, including family, must be subordinate. Their status exists only if those around them - especially their wives and children - take precedence over other relatives. Charles, according to Harry, stopped taking his calls, cut off his funding, and forced him to rely on producer Tyler Perry for his personal security. Harry said he had nothing but respect for the Queen. He said his father had hurt him in failing to understand what his new bride was going through. And William, he said, had been welcoming, but there was now \"space\" between them. Perhaps Meghan didn't understand the constitutional need for silence. But there was no constitutional need to let the world think she'd made Kate cry - a lie that was briefed by someone who knew all those present and, presumably, knew the truth. And who wanted to protect Kate. A future monarch has to keep his family in their place. Part of the bitterness between Charles and Diana was that her star quality eclipsed him, and the crown cannot be made to look dull. Did someone see that in Diana's second son, history might repeat itself? Read more  Whoever worried about Archie's skin colour was also powerful enough to fear what would happen if a future Queen was booed by the huge crowds that gathered to watch the wedding procession in Windsor. That lie protected the throne, as well as Kate.  Whoever partook in conversations about the future of the Royal Family in terms of titles and costs was thinking about what shape it would be in 50 or 100 years' time. Whoever wanted to know how brown Archie would be was a product of a world that has been limited, in terms of position and parenting. And whoever it is would be \"very damaged\" if Meghan and Harry detonated the bomb they dangled before the world last night.      An heir to the throne so closeted, thoughtless, and unpleasant as to ask, repeatedly, why anyone should honour or protect a  brown  baby could not be Head of the Commonwealth. He could not be king at all, for long, of a diverse population with views more modern than his.  Last night, Meghan said, in effect: \"Back off. Leave us be, or this goes bang and you go with it.\" She was talking to someone who could be severely wounded by her revelations of feeling mentally unwell, asking for help, and being told that it was not \"good for the institution\" - precisely the same attitude which did so much damage to Diana.  There are few ways the Palace could brief, now, against a woman who has spoken of feeling suicidal, or who was previously lied about by them. The interview puts into context the couple's unwillingness to share Archie with the world, to do as instructed, and the emotions running rampant as her father played with the paparazzi, a Queen-to-be pulled rank, and an unborn child was denigrated even as he grew in his mother's belly.  No matter how high-handed Meghan was with her staff, public sympathy will always lie with a baby who has done no wrong. It's why Diana's sons are still adored, and why perhaps we know comparatively little about the one who will one day be King. And what didn't Meghan say, in that interview which said so much? She praised the Queen, she forgave Kate, but she didn't mention William once. Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inbox "

            "text": " For decades, Chinese construction companies have thrived far away from their home. In TT alone, Chinese firms have helped build landmark monuments like the National Academy for the Performing Arts (Napa) and its southern counterpart. And just last year, Government announced that ten companies are expected to invest in the Phoenix Park Industrial Estate, in Point Lisas. The key behind this success, according to the regional manager of one such company, comes from strong Chinese work ethic, understanding the local market and a desire to train and improve the proficiency of local workers. Business Day spoke with Yan Meng, managing director of the China Railway Construction (Caribbean) Company's (CRCC) TT subsidiary, at his Queen\u2019s Park East office recently to find out more about his company\u2019s roots in TT, opportunities for growth and expectations for the future.   The CRCC came to TT in 2007 after being contracted to build the Scarborough General Hospital in Signal Hill, Tobago for $477 million. Despite being a fairly recent arrival, the CRCC has been involved in several high-profile infrastructure projects, including the Arima hospital, the Curepe interchange and the St James hospital. While some critics have described China\u2019s growing interest in the Caribbean as akin to \u201cpseudo-imperialism,\u201d Meng says Chinese business interests in the Caribbean are mutually beneficial to both the company and the local population. \u201cIn all of our projects there is more than 50 per cent local labour, while Chinese workers make up management and technical positions. We\u2019re not just here to deliver the project, we also have to transfer the technical knowledge and work attitude to the local people. At times the work attitude in Trinidad is different to ours. We try to find a balance between us and local workers,\u201d Meng said.   This exchange of information is evident in the historic memorandum of understanding signing, last September, between the CRCC and the Tobago House of Assembly (THA), when four local engineers were invited to attend an internship programme at various CRCC projects in TT. \u201cAt the Curepe interchange, my Chinese technicians are working together with the Trinidadian workers to do the reinforcement (of the structure).\u201d Meng, who visits CRCC\u2019s projects each week to supervise the progress, said he was \u201cthoroughly impressed\u201d with the pace of works and said despite minor hiccups in productivity, he was pleased with the quality of work from local workers. After a competitive bid round, CRCC was awarded the $221.7 million contract for the Curepe interchange. Meng said despite competitive bidding, part of his company\u2019s success was its ability to deliver quality service at an affordable price, and credited this philosophy of performance over cost for part of his company\u2019s international success. \u201cWe serve all of our clients the same, whether government or private. One of the reasons we have survived as long as we have is our dedication to consistently giving good work. The same quality of work we would give to one company is the same we intend to deliver to another of a lower price.\u201d As the Chinese economy recorded its slowest rate of growth for 28 years last year, companies operating abroad may feel a crunch, but Meng says he is confident the CRCC is prepared for fluctuations in the market. \u201cConstruction is not an easy industry, but that\u2019s the key to thriving in tough times. Sometimes when the financing for a particular project is slowed down, we continue to finance it through our own resources. \u201cWe are confident in the Trinidadian government to pay. But the procedure takes long sometimes. As responsible contractors we will not stop the work. We will, on a short-term basis, use our own money to maintain the work for the period we don\u2019t get the money,\u201d Yan said. This work ethic has proved successful, as the parent company was ranked the third largest construction company in the world in 2017 by the Engineering News Record. Meng\u2019s Queen\u2019s Park East office serves not only as the headquarters for all his company\u2019s construction activities in the country, but for the Caribbean region. The reason for using TT as the base of operations, he says, was because of its relatively stable political system, fairly large economy and diverse population. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with the unity here in TT. There are different ethnicities \u2013 African, Indian, Chinese, Arab, European. All of the ethnicities operate as one, there is no discrimination. So I was very impressed. I feel very comfortable.\u201d With Guyana poised to become one of the largest oil-producing countries in the world in the next five years, Meng says there is also great interest in expanding there. On the collapse of the Guyanese government late last year, he says while the CRCC is interested in increasing operations before the oil boom starts, it needed to wait and see how the government develops before investing. And while Chinese investment in TT has not slowed, Meng said the relationship between TT and China can go even further with greater trust from both sides. \u201cBoth local and international contractors have to learn to work together, use the right suppliers, contractors to achieve (success). Understanding the market is a big part of our success, and we ensure that when we do business, everyone wins.\u201d"

The five-star resort was destroyed by fire in 2010, but construction has begun on a resort on the site that, when completed, will rival any other tourist destination in the world for its luxury, business and well-being facilities.\n       \n        China has played an important part in its redevelopment via a $170 million preferential loan to fund the project.\n         \n          It was the first major preferential loan China has made to the tourism sector in Barbados since President Xi Jinping announced in 2013 that $1.5 billion in preferential loans would be made available to the Caribbean.\n           \n            China's Ambassador to Barbados Wang Ke said at the groundbreaking ceremony that the investment wrote \"a new chapter in the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Barbados, making China the only country to offer large-scale preferential loans to finance infrastructure projects in Barbados\".\n             \n              \"The hotel will play a positive role in attracting more foreign exchange income into Barbados and increasing employment.

            "text": " PM Stuart Barbados can expect more loans from the People\u2019s Republic of China under preferential terms to fund a number of infrastructure and development projects, including expansion\u00a0of the Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA). Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People\u2019s Republic of China to Barbados Wang Ke disclosed that Beijing was prepared to offer \u201clarge scale preferential\u201d loans to Barbados for a wide range of projects as a show of confidence in the country. Government today signed a preferential loan agreement with the Export-import Bank (Exim Bank) of China which will fund the Sam Lord\u2019s Castle redevelopment project. The agreement, which comes after about 18 months of negotiation, will see the disbursement of US$170 million for the construction of a Wyndham Hotel and reconstruction of the Castle on the old Sam Lord\u2019s Castle site in St Philip. Ke said the St Philip project was the \u201cvery first of its kind\u201d large scale infrastructure project in Barbados for which China was offering funding under preferential terms. \u201cThis makes China the only country that offers large scale preferential loan to finance\u00a0infrastructure projects in Barbados, which not only shows that China remains confident in Barbados\u2019 tourism industry and its national economy, but also write a new chapter in China-Barbados partnership of neutral benefit and win-win corporation,\u201d said the\u00a0Chinese diplomat. \u201cI would like to mention that besides Sam Lord\u2019s Castle hotel, China and Barbados are negotiating several other projects to be funded by China preferential loans such as the reconstruction and expansion of the Grantley Adams International Airport and Pier-head Marina project in Bridgetown.\u201d She said the loan agreement would not only promote bilateral corporation but would also bring \u201cnew vitality into partnership of comprehensive coorporation\u201d between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries. \u201cI hope the two sides, taking Sam Lords Castle hotel project as an example, could push for negotiations of further corporation and continuously gain new achievements so as to bring more and greater benefits to our two countries and peoples,\u201d she added. Ground breaking for the Sam Lord\u2019s Castle project is expected to take place on Monday, followed by the construction of the multi- million dollar international brand name hotel led by the China National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation Group. \u201cI expect and believe that the construction and future operation of the Sam Lords Castle hotel will play a positive role in further advancing the contribution that tourism makes to Barbados national economy. Meanwhile the Sam Lord\u2019s Castle hotel will lay a solid foundation and set up a pilot project as well for more capable Chinese enterprises that are about to participate in Barbados infrastructure projects,\u201d said Ke. Pointing out other areas of \u201cChinese participation\u201d in the development of Barbados, including the Garfield Sobers Sports Complex, Prime Minister Freundel Stuart said the\u00a0signing marked another phase of the relationship between the two countries. And he expressed confidence that the redevelopment of the Sam Lord\u2019s Castle and the construction of the Wyndham hotel would benefit the island\u2019s tourism\u00a0product tremendously. \u201cMay we hope this is the first of a series\u00a0of new developmental initiatives to further define and enrich the relationship between Barbados and the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d said Stuart. \u201cIt [the hotel] has been targeted to cater to couples as well as to have a special appeal to families as this group usually travels in the summer. This in itself will significantly help our tourism product in the slower summer months as Barbados is striving to become a true year round destination and not just a winter destination as it is traditionally known.\u201d \nView All Events\n The Barbados International Business Association (BIBA) is a private sector organization comprising companies engaged in international business in Barbados.

            "text": "  BARCELONA \u2014 Barcelona members elected Joan Laporta as club president on Sunday, turning to the man who oversaw one of their most successful periods to lead them out of an institutional and financial crisis. Laporta, who was Bar\u00e7a president between 2003 and 2010, won a resounding 54.28% of total votes, while Victor Font came second with 29.99% and Toni Freixa was third with 8.58%. ADVERTISEMENT Laporta, 58, succeeds Josep Maria Bartomeu, who resigned as president in October to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from members who turned on him after Lionel Messi tried to leave the club last August and the team were beaten 8-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Messi was among several Bar\u00e7a players to vote in the election a day after winning 2-0 at Osasuna to go second in La Liga. Bar\u00e7a said 51,765 out of 109,531 eligible members had voted in the election, which was postponed from January due to coronavirus restrictions in Catalonia. A total of 30,184 people voted for Laporta. Laporta celebrated his victory by singing the club\u2019s anthem with his campaign team and sipping champagne before giving his victory speech, in which he gave a special mention to captain and all-time top scorer Messi, who has less than four months left on his contract with Bar\u00e7a. \u201cTwenty years ago a little boy called Leo Messi made his debut with Bar\u00e7a\u2019s youth team. Seeing the best player in the world come out to vote today is a clear sign of what we keep saying. Leo loves Bar\u00e7a,\u201d Laporta said. \u201cThe best player in the world loves Bar\u00e7a and I hope that is a sign that he will stay at Barcelona, which is what we all want.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT HUGE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS\nLaporta takes over a club with huge financial problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic eliminating ticket revenue and badly hitting merchandising income. Bar\u00e7a\u2019s last accounts showed a gross debt of more than \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.67 billion) with a net debt of \u20ac488 million. The club agreed a temporary player pay-cut last year while it had to delay payments to players in December. Yet things are looking up on the pitch, with Ronald Koeman\u2019s side winning 13 of their last 16 league games and reaching the Copa del Rey final. Laporta\u2019s first match in his second spell as president is Wednesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 second leg away to Paris St. Germain, with Bar\u00e7a trailing 4-1 in the tie. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re off to Paris to stage a comeback.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT Laporta was first elected in 2003 and presided over a golden period in the club\u2019s history which witnessed four La Liga titles and two Champions League triumphs. He ran in the 2015 elections, but was emphatically beaten by incumbent Bartomeu. ADVERTISEMENT Bartomeu was arrested last Monday in a Catalan police probe related to allegations of improper management and business corruption which also saw the club\u2019s Camp Nou offices raided. He has not commented on his arrest and made use of his right not to give a statement in court. \u2014 Reuters ADVERTISEMENT"

Human Rights groups are outraged over the deaths of what they said were legitimate activists under the guise of counter-insurgency operations, which came two days after Duterte told security forces they could kill rebels if they were holding a gun and to \u201cignore human rights\u201d.  \u201cThe president\u2019s \u2018kill, kill, kill\u2019 order is legal because it was directed at armed rebels,\u201d his spokesman Harry Roque said in a briefing, adding the government would still investigate the incident. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, an influential church group, in a statement denounced the use of what it called unnecessary force and violence during \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d. On Sunday, Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade, head of an anti-rebel task force, told Reuters the raids were \u201clegitimate law enforcement operations\u201d, and authorities had search warrants for firearms and explosives. Activists said the raids were reminiscent of police operations in which thousands of people have been killed as part of Duterte\u2019s signature war on drugs, in which police said all of the victims were armed and had resisted arrest.    Among those killed was a coordinator of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, a left-wing group that has called for an end to \u201cred-tagging\u201d, the practice of labelling opponents communists or terrorists to justify targeting them, which dates back to the the rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Human Rights Watch said the government\u2019s counter-insurgency campaign no longer makes a distinction between armed rebels and non-combatant activists, labour leaders, and rights defenders. Since coming to power in 2016, Duterte has seen his efforts to forge peace with Maoist rebels derailed repeatedly, prompting frequent outbursts and threats to wipe them out.  \n (This story refiles to fix order of misplaced word \u2018kill\u2019 in paragraph 1) \n  (Reporting by Karen Lema; Editing by Martin Petty) Subscribe Sign up for our daily news explosion."

The individuals, Viktor Vorontsov, 39, and Zlata Hanska Muzhuk, 40, of Ukraine, were arrested in the Czech Republic. They were indicted in February 2020 in the Northern District of Texas. According to the indictment, the two were part of a cash-out and money laundering network offering services to cybercriminals who accessed bank accounts using stolen credentials, and then transferred funds to drop accounts maintained by the cash-out actors. Muzhuk and Vorontsov, the indictment reveals, operated a network of drop accounts and money mules that facilitated the fraudulent transfer of money from victims. The conspiracy existed \u201cfor the entirety of 2017,\u201d the indictment reveals. In October and November of that year, roughly $500,000 were transferred as part of the conspiracy. The Czech National Organized Crime Agency (NCOZ) collaborated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in gathering evidence against Muzhuk and Vorontsov. A criminal complaint and an arrest warrant were issued in early 2020 in Dallas, and the two were arrested in the Czech Republic, where Muzhuk was visiting Vorontsov at his residence. Both were detained pending the extradition proceedings and were transferred to FBI custody on March 3, 2021, after their extraditions were granted by the Ministry of Justice of the Czech Republic, in January and February. They both appeared in court in the Northern District of Texas and entered not-guilty pleas to the charges.

Founded by Priyanka Gill, POPxo is India's largest online community of women and has been a champion of women for the last seven years, telling their stories and lifting them up. The POPxo Power Women List is an extension of that endeavour. A POPxo Power Woman is someone on a mission to make the world a better place. She strives to become the best version of herself, on her own terms. She inspires and motivates us to write our own success stories. 2020 was a year of unprecedented crisis, and we all made efforts to overcome challenges. However, some women hit it out of the park by not only swiftly adapting to the new normal, but also making strides that had a lasting impact. A key to real change, their power moves helped them reinvent and shape their company/ brand and the world for the better. These women have shown by example that there are no barriers when it comes to wanting to make a difference and achieving a goal. That is what makes them unstoppable and that is why they are recognised as POPxo Power Women.

(ANI/ThePRTree) ANI 8th March 2021, 21:03 GMT+11 New Delhi [India], March 8 (ANI/ThePRTree): The POPxo Power Women List is an annual list that celebrates incredible Indian women from diverse domains who make power moves that have a real impact.

The POPxo Power Women List is an extension of that endeavour. A POPxo Power Woman is someone on a mission to make the world a better place. She strives to become the best version of herself, on her own terms. She inspires and motivates us to write our own success stories. 2020 was a year of unprecedented crisis, and we all made efforts to overcome challenges. However, some women hit it out of the park by not only swiftly adapting to the new normal, but also making strides that had a lasting impact. A key to real change, their power moves helped them reinvent and shape their company/ brand and the world for the better. These women have shown by example that there are no barriers when it comes to wanting to make a difference and achieving a goal. That is what makes them unstoppable and that is why they are recognised as POPxo Power Women.

AT&T Inc., Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and Marriott International are expected to announce agreements with Cuban government-run entities. Earlier this week, in a letter to Treasure and Commerce Secretaries Jack Lew and Penny Pritzker, respectively, Senator Amy Klobuchar urged an amendment to regulations to authorize US investment in the Cuban hotel industry. White House officials expressed hope some of these deals would come together before Mr. Obama arrives in Havana March 20. Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, vice chair of the President\u2019s Export Council, will travel to Cuba with Mr. Obama. \u201cWe are optimistic that we are going to get a green light soon from the U.S. government to have hotels under the Marriott flag in Cuba,\u201d said Thomas Marder, a Marriott spokesman.  comments  Find a Cuba Tour Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube \u00a9 2021 CubaJournal.

British television broadcaster Piers Morgan was dragged by Trisha Goddard after he disregarded Meghan Markle\u2019s racist experience during her time with the royal family. Trisha appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey. The Duchess of Sussex had revealed in the interview that an unnamed member of the family questioned her Archie's skin colour when she was still pregnant with him. While she did not name the family member because \"it would be very damaging\", it was understandable that there were racist undertones in their exchange with Meghan. However, Piers thought otherwise and instead questioned whether the exchange could even be \"automatically racist\" which led to Trisha firing back: \"Why is everybody else such an expert about racism against Black people?\" \"I\u2019m sorry, Piers \u2013 you don\u2019t get to call out what is and isn\u2019t racism against Black people. I\u2019ll leave you to call out all the other stuff you want, but leave the racism stuff to us, eh? \"You are such a disappointment. I wish to God one day you even surprise me. You constantly use your platform as a wealthy, white, privileged man,\" she said.  Morgan responded by saying that Meghan's claim was \"a very serious allegation\" and an \"incendiary charge\" levied against the royal family. He added that \"it\u2019s not fair\" to hold back on revealing the identity of \"the supposed racist\". However, Trisha's fiery comments saw a large number of supporters with some saying that she \"annihilated\" the television host.  \"Put Trisha Goddard\u2019s one sentence annihilation of Piers Morgan in the history books,\" one user said.  One person thanked Trisha for \"calling him out the way [she] did\". Another said: \"Trisha Goddard flat out calling Piers Morgan a bully on national TV is exactly the energy I needed this morning.\" \"Piers Morgan being called out by Trisha Goddard has made my day,\" another user said.\u00a0 Addison Rae takes to Twitter to share that she has been banned from TikTok  'Kurulus:Osman' has returned for the season 3 Experts believe Harry, Meghan Markle are on the road towards becoming the \u2018world\u2019s richest personal brand\u2019 Prince Harry, Meghan Markle accused of diving into banking job despite \u2018knowing zero\u2019 about finances Experts worry Prince Harry may include struggles faced during Lilibet\u2019s christening Prince Harry, Meghan Markle\u2019s accused of siding with companies with stock in big pharma"

Impact investments, which combine sustainability, social entrepreneurship and social responsibility, present important opportunities for humanity,\" Erdogan said.It will be \"very significant\" to support companies bringing together this innovative approach with the current conditions of business and social life, he added. \"We will provide all the support necessary to efforts in impact investment as the Presidency and through our institutions.\"He underlined that the novel coronavirus pandemic had deeply affected economies, while also negatively impacting many other areas from politics to social life.Turkey is among the few countries that overcame this crisis with the minimum damage, he said.Erdogan also noted that Turkey's economy grew by 1.8% in 2020 -- the most in the world after China.He said that during the most difficult days of the outbreak, Turkey had helped 157 countries and 12 international organizations with medical support.Government support for Turkish citizens against the pandemic's effects, meanwhile, reached a value of 311 billion Turkish liras (over $40 billion), he added.The 11th Bosphorus Summit, organized by the International Cooperation Platform (ICP), was attended internationally by academics, politicians, and experts. Living in an age of uncertainty is its main theme.The two-day summit will focus on several areas, such as agriculture, international cooperation, smart cities, the defense industry, China's One Belt One Road Initiative, the future of the finance sector, and digitalization. -\n                                                         "

In an event held in Yaguaramas town in the central province of Cienfuegos, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Chen Xi handed the management of the two parks over to the Cuban Ministry of Energy and Mines. \"These two parks have a total capacity of 9 megawatts (MW) and the one in Yaguaramas is the largest in Cuba with 19,440 solar panels installed,\" Chen said. After 18 months of construction, the two parks, one in the western province of Pinar del Rio and the other in Yaguaramas, started operations in February. \"This is a sign of friendship and willingness by the Chinese government towards the Cuban people. The confidence, brotherhood and solidarity between our countries grow day by day,\" Chen said. Meanwhile, Cuba's Deputy Minister of Energy and Mines Ruben Cid stressed that these facilities are part of a solar panel project financed by the Ministry of Commerce of China with a total capacity of 21 MW. Cid said China has actively participated in the renewable energy program that seeks to generate 24 percent of electricity in Cuba by 2030. \"To date we have worked intensely with Chinese companies and institutions to carry out two wind farms in the province of Las Tunas, 319 MW in generation through solar panel parks and several bioelectric plants next to sugar refineries,\" he said. He added that Cuba plans to build 25 bioelectric plants with a generation capacity of 755 MW as well as 14 wind farms to produce 656 MW by 2030. Also, the country expects to install a capacity of 700 MW in solar panel parks and build 74 small hydroelectric plants to generate 56 MW.

The cases were detected among 16,476 tests, with only 14 cases found among travelers arriving at Beirut International Airport. The positivity rate throughout the last week stood at 17.5 percent. The total number of cases since coronavirus was first detected in Lebanon on Feb. 21, 2020, now stands at 395,588, according to the Health Ministry. The total number of fatalities has risen to 5,046.

In fact, changing weather patterns actually have some locations cooling. One rather conspicuous spot of cooling is in the northern Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland. The air there is cooling because the ocean there is cooling due to an increase in melt water from the Greenland glacier. This is fresh water (not salty) which is disrupting the flow of the saltier, heavier water of the Gulf Stream, which carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico toward the British Isles. A recent study in Nature Geoscience used ocean sediments to construct a history of the Gulf Stream and determined that the current has weakened 15% since the mid-20th Century. Potential impacts include an enhancement of European summer droughts. "

            "text": " The Curepe interchange, currently being constructed on the Churchill Roosevelt Highway, will be in use by driver at the end of February. So said Minister of Works and Transport, Rohan Sinanan, on Sunday morning as he witnessed 12 massive steel girders being installed at the base of the interchange. \u201cToday is really a milestone for us because on February 20 last year, the Prime Minister turned the sod for this interchange,\u201d Sinanan said. \u201cAnd here we are, less than a year later, we are launching the beams for the bridge. We anticipate that we should have full use of the bridge by the end of February, which is just about a year since the sod was turned.\u201d He said the actual handover of the interchange will be done in March. Sinanan said two ancillary roads were also built to provide access to the interchange, and the project is still on schedule and is \u201cwell within the budget\u201d of $221 million. Engineers used heavy machinery to lift and place the 12 girders on the gap between the two ramps on either side of the highway, but before that engineer from the China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) celebrated the milestone by setting off strings of firecrackers. Newsday was told that six beams were placed over the westbound lane of the highway during the morning period on Sunday and in the afternoon, the other six beams were placed at the eastbound lane. The section of the Churchill Roosevelt Highway in Curepe was closed to vehicular traffic on Sunday to facilitate the installation. The highway was expected to be reopened today at 4 am, in time for the start of the new school term. Sinanan said if all goes well, this could be one of the better managed projects in TT's history, despite challenges with procurement of land for construction of the interchange. \u201cThis is expected to take a year and one month. That has to go down into the archives as the fastest interchange ever built in TT,\u201d Sinanan said. He noted that other interchanges, like the one at Grand Bazaar, were opened in phases over a number of years. Sinanan added that the Curepe Interchange project would be one of many planned for the Churchill Roosevelt highway, with the ultimate goal of removing all traffic lights on this highway from Sangre Grande to Port of Spain. Sinanan said a tender was put out for companies to be selected for primary designs for two more interchanges, one at Macoya and another in Piarco. Consultants are expected to advise them on the best locations for the next interchanges and his ministry is expected to go before Cabinet with the results of the tender and a contract for designs of the next interchange is expected to be awarded in the coming months. \u201cWe will continue to build interchanges as we go along. We can\u2019t build all at the same time but the idea is as one is completed, the other should be far more advanced in terms of starting the construction.\u201d \u201cEventually we would reach the point where you could drive from PoS to Grande without any traffic lights interfering. The pace this project was completed we should have all the interchanges completed in the next three to four years,\u201d Sinanan said.\n"

            "text": " LGBT+ people living in a refugee camp in northwestern Kenya urged UN officials on Friday to move them to a safer area following a series of homophobic attacks by other residents and locals. The refugees, who come from countries including Uganda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, said a section of the Kakuma camp occupied by 135 LGBT+ refugees had been attacked at least five times since the start of the year. In one incident last month, three gay men needed hospital treatment for burns after attackers set their bedding alight as they slept. LGBT+ refugees have also been beaten, pelted with rocks and stabbed, said Gilbert Kagarura, spokesman for the camp\u2019s \u201cBlock 13\u201d area. \u201cWe left our homes and came here to be safe, but even here we are hunted and attacked. We want to be moved to another area of camp,\u201d said Gilbert Kagarura, who fled persecution in Uganda two years ago. \u201cViolence against LGBT+ people in Kakuma camp has been happening for years. Homophobia is ingrained here. The other refugees and community members simply look for excuses to come after us and attack us,\u201d he said. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR), which runs the Kakuma camp, said Kenyan police were investigating the suspected arson attack and that the victims had received psychological support. It said relocation decisions are made on \u201can individual and case by case basis\u201d following a thorough assessment jointly with Kenyan authorities and local partners. \u201cUNHCR has continued to engage individually with LGBTIQ+ refugees. Some 30 persons have been relocated to other areas of the camp over the past few months,\u201d said a UNHCR statement emailed to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. LGBT+ refugees said they want to be relocated as a group for safety reasons. Over the last three years, LGBT+ refugees in Kakuma \u2013 a sprawling camp home to more than 160 000 people \u2013 have repeatedly complained about their security and have staged demonstrations to demand safe shelter. In December 2018, the UNHCR relocated about 200 LGBT+ refugees from the camp to Nairobi as an emergency measure after a spate of violent attacks against them. But Kenya requires most refugees to stay in designated camps and some of them were returned to Kakuma. New LGBT+ refugees are also mostly being sent there. There are currently about 300 LGBT+ refugees in the camp in total, with the vast majority living in relative safety, according to the UNHCR, adding that more police had been deployed to areas where LGBT+ refugees reside. Although gay sex is punishable with up to 14 years in jail in Kenya, the law is rarely enforced and the east African nation is seen as more tolerant than neighboring Uganda and Tanzania, though discrimination is widespread. LGBT+ rights groups Pan Africa ILGA and the Global Interfaith Network have voiced concern about the attacks at Kakuma and are backing calls for the refugees to be relocated. \u201cWe urge UNHCR to take this crisis seriously and to take all members of Block 13 to a temporary safe place as they await evacuation from a clearly highly homophobic camp,\u201d they said in a joint statement last month.

Florida is getting busy.\u00a0Disney theme parks in Orlando are booked solid next Monday through Thursday. Throngs of college students are strolling the strip in Fort Lauderdale, many without masks and ignoring social distancing.\u00a0At least one\u00a0hot spot there, however, is pumping the brakes.\u00a0 The outdoor event space The Wharf, featuring live music, food and drink, announced on social media that during the spring break season guests with out-of-state ID must be 23 or older.

We will arrest you and it will ruin your time here.\" Help is on the way:\u00a0The U.S. vaccination rate has risen to\u00a0an average of 2.2 million doses per day, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff\u00a0Zients announced. New York City alone administered 100,000 doses over the weekend. Also in the news:\u00a0 \u25baThe seven-day rolling average for daily new cases and COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. has decreased over the past two weeks. Infections dwindled from 66,162\u00a0on Feb. 21 to 57,972\u00a0on Sunday, while fatalities dropped from 1,873 on Feb. 21 to 1,677 on Sunday. \u25baMillions of Americans should start to see\u00a0stimulus checks\u00a0of up to $1,400 land in their bank accounts in just a few weeks.\u00a0The one-time payments are part of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion\u00a0COVID-relief package\u00a0that\u2019s expected to get final approval in the House on Wednesday. \u25baItaly surpassed 100,000 dead in the pandemic, a year after it became the first country in Europe to go on lockdown.

A sixth state, Alabama,\u00a0extended the mandate\u00a0but said it would end on April 9. Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, whose order goes into effect March 16, also said several businesses will be able to resume normal operations.\u00a0They include establishments that typically operate indoors, such as bars, theaters, gyms and restaurants. The discarding of masking requirements by some states drew a rebuke last week from President Joe Biden, who likened the decisions to \"Neanderthal thinking,'' and a warning against prematurely removing restrictions\u00a0from the CDC. Satisfaction with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has increased enough that a majority of both Democrats and Republicans approve of it, but 1 out of every 4 Americans still say they'll never get the vaccine if they can avoid it, according to a new Monmouth University poll.\u00a0 Of the 60% of respondents who said they're at least somewhat satisfied with the vaccine rollout, 69% are Democrats and 58% Republicans. Partisanship is more of a dividing line in the decision to skip the vaccine, with 36% of Republicans saying they want to avoid it, compared to only 6% of Democrats. The survey also reveals the public is generally more pessimistic about how long it will take to return to normalcy after the pandemic, with 21% saying by the summer \u2013\u00a0down from 29% in a January survey \u2013\u00a040% saying by the end of the year and 27% saying even later. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased guidelines for fully vaccinated Americans on Monday, saying they can visit with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing.\u00a0They can also visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 \u2013 indoors and without wearing masks or physical distancing. Fully vaccinated people\u00a0also don't need to\u00a0quarantine or get testing following a known exposure if asymptomatic.\u00a0But they still must take precautions in public such as wearing a well-fitted mask and physical distancing and avoidance of medium- and large-size\u00a0in-person gatherings. \"COVID-19 continues to exact a tremendous toll on our nation,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing of the White House COVID-19 Response Team. \"Science and the protection of public health must guide us as we begin to resume activities.\" Read more: Your questions answered on the new CDC guidelines. The Biden administration said Monday that it is taking steps to combat Russian disinformation aimed at undermining confidence in the vaccines produced by Pfizer Inc. and other Western companies. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki's remarks\u00a0came in the wake of a Sunday report in the Wall Street Journal that four publications, all serving as fronts for Russian intelligence, have targeted Western-produced COVID-19 vaccines with misleading coverage that exaggerates the risk of side effects and raises questions about their efficacy. \u201cWe will fight (the disinformation) with every tool we have,\u201d Psaki said during a press briefing on Monday. \u2013 Deirdre Shesgreen More than\u00a0100,000 New Yorker City residents were vaccinated over the weekend, raising the total doses administered in the city to more than 2.3 million, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. The mayor said the city could vaccinate 500,000 per week if it can get more supply. Many residents who \"had hesitation before\" about getting vaccinated told him they are now ready, de Blasio said. And the Johnson & Johnson shot is the vaccine of choice, he said. \"One of the most consistent things we heard is people want the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because it's one dose and you're done,\" the mayor said. President Joe Biden will make the first prime-time address of his term\u00a0Thursday night to commemorate\u00a0the one-year anniversary of shutdowns\u00a0taken across the nation at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who announced the address, did not provide\u00a0a time or say where the president will deliver remarks.\u00a0State lockdowns rapidly closed businesses across the country, spiking unemployment to a high of 14.8% last April before slowly improving. \"He will discuss the many sacrifices that the American people have made over the last year and the grave loss communities and families across the country have suffered,\" Psaki said. \"The president will look forward, highlighting the role that Americans will play in beating the virus and moving the country to getting back to normal.\" \u2013 Joey Garrison The number of Americans now completely vaccinated for COVID-19 has surpassed the number of reported cases of the virus since the pandemic began more than a year ago. Just over 31\u00a0million people have been completely vaccinated, 9.4% of the population, according to the CDC. The Johns Hopkins data dashboard counts 29 million cases of the virus reported nationwide, but experts warn that reported cases likely represent a fraction of actual infections. Recent studies indicate that adults with Down syndrome, specifically those 40 and older, are\u00a0three to 10 times as likely\u00a0to die from COVID-19 than the general population. The findings confirmed what many had already suspected \u2013 that those with\u00a0the genetic disorder,\u00a0already prone to respiratory issues, heart conditions and other risk factors for coronavirus, were more susceptible to the virus\u2019 harmful effects. But Down syndrome priority for the vaccine varies from state to state. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they should be moved to the front of the line,\u201d said Republican Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen of Minnesota, lead author of a letter signed by bipartisan state legislators last month imploring health officials to prioritize\u00a0adults with the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how dangerous it could be for these individuals if they don\u2019t get the vaccine.\u201d \u2013 Marc Ramirez The U.S.\u00a0added a record 380 new coronavirus variant cases Sunday, continuing a trend that has seen the country double its known total of such coronavirus infections since Feb. 18. Different\u00a0versions of the virus that causes COVID-19 are spreading quickly even as the pace of new infections has generally been falling nationwide. The variants can spread more easily, dodge some treatments and immunities or both, leaving them a threat even as more Americans get vaccinated. The U.S. has 3,133 known variant cases, up from the 2,753 reported Thursday,\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control said Sunday. Most of America's known variant cases are of B.1.1.7, which was first seen in the United Kingdom, with 3,037. Vaccines have proved\u00a0effective against it, but the variant is considered\u00a0at least 50% more infectious than the original strain, making fast, widespread vaccination imperative. \u2013 Mike Stucka This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Spring break in Florida won't be 'anything goes' this year; Wyoming becomes fifth state to drop mask mandate: Live COVID-19 updates Like us on Facebook to see similar stories Please give an overall site rating:"

            "text": " Pope Francis\u2019 historic trip to Iraq went off without a hitch \u2014 an image boost Baghdad hopes will help revive international engagement, foreign investment and even tourism. But while the government hailed the pontiff\u2019s successful visit as a \u201cturning point\u201d, country experts cautioned that the threats of violence and political turmoil have not vanished overnight. The 84-year-old pontiff\u2019s four-day visit was a bold trip by any measure: Iraq has long been a byword for conflict, and many countries actively discourage their citizens from visiting. Recent years have seen major battles to oust the Islamic State group, rockets attacks against the US-led coalition, and deadly street clashes between protesters and security forces. The pope\u2019s visit stood in welcome contrast as Francis criss-crossed the country and spread his message of peace and reconciliation to jubilant crowds of faithful and well-wishers. Baghdad believes it marked a turning point that will change Iraq\u2019s image as a dangerous destination, foreign ministry spokesman Ahmad al-Sahhaf told AFP as the pope\u2019s plane left for Rome. \u201cIf Iraq was not stable and secure, would someone of the stature of the pope have been able to travel all around?\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole world was following the success of this trip.\u201d A senior security official told AFP that intelligence agencies had worked day and night as Francis toured sites including the northern city of Mosul, a former IS bastion still largely in ruins, and\u00a0nearby plains where paramilitaries remain powerful. \u201cThe fact that there was no security issue, not even a tiny one,\u201d the official said, \u201cproves Iraq is done with terrorism and can protect foreign delegations who will come more easily in the future.\u201d To mark the historic visit, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi announced that March 6 \u2014 the day Francis visited top Muslim Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in the shrine city of Najaf \u2014 would from now be marked as a national day of coexistence. On Monday, Kadhemi said in a televised address that Iraq now had a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d to improve ties among its diverse ethno-religious communities and political parties. Indeed the pope\u2019s high-profile visit would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. In late 2017, Iraqi forces were fighting to defeat the Islamic State group\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate, which had stretched from Syria across much of the country\u2019s north for three years after a decade of sectarian violence. In 2019, street rallies erupted against corruption, unemployment and poor public services, with at least 600 people killed since in protest-related violence. Their demands were not met, and deadly demonstrations again shook Baghdad days before the pope\u2019s visit, just a short drive from where he held an interfaith service. \u201cIraq faces many challenges and the visit perhaps made us forget about them for few days,\u201d Farhad Alaaldin, chairman of the Iraq Advisory Council, told AFP. \u201cBut they remain in place and are lurking menacingly.\u201d One way Iraq could \u201ccapitalise\u201d on the trip, Alaaldin said, would be to revamp the roads and tourism sites visited by the pope, including the ancient site of Ur, where the Prophet Abraham is thought to have been born. Ur is just one of dozens of historic sites across Iraq, known as a \u201ccradle of civilisation\u201d, that showcase millenia of Mesopotamian, Christian and Islamic heritage, but investment in them has been slim amid the years of turmoil. Authorities also need to take a hard look at the dismal conditions in which most of Iraq\u2019s 40 million people live, said political analyst Osama Saidi. The poverty rate has doubled to 40 per cent in the past year due to a collapse in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 13,000 Iraqi lives. Most people still only get a few hours of state-provided electricity per day and, apart from roads freshly paved for the pope\u2019s convoy, most streets flood in the winter. \u201cAfter this trip, all the infrastructure needs to be re-assessed and everything must be done to make this country livable,\u201d Saidi told AFP. \u201cOfficials need to step up.\u201d Sajad Jiyad, a fellow at US think-tank the Century Foundation, told AFP that Francis\u2019 visit was \u201cbrave\u201d but that it highlighted the failures of authorities instead of their successes. \u201cThe pope was sitting in front of the ruins of a church more than three years after Mosul was liberated \u2014 it doesn\u2019t reflect well on the Iraqi government,\u201d he said. With political tensions high as parliamentary elections draw closer, some fear the feel-good Francis vibes may dissipate quickly. \u201cUnfortunately, at this moment it looks like there are going to be more sad news stories ahead rather than good news stories,\u201d said Jiyad.

REUTERS/Hoang Dinh Nam/Pool MANILA: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's order to armed kill rebels was legal, his spokesman said on Monday (Mar 8), as catholic leaders joined condemnation of the killings of nine activists in separate weekend raids against suspected insurgents. Human Rights groups are outraged over the deaths of what they said were legitimate activists under the guise of counter-insurgency operations, which came two days after Duterte told security forces they could kill rebels if they were holding a gun and to \"ignore human rights\". \"The president's 'kill, kill, kill' order is legal because it was directed at armed rebels,\" his spokesman Harry Roque said in a briefing, adding the government would still investigate the incident. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, an influential church group, in a statement denounced the use of what it called unnecessary force and violence during \"Bloody Sunday\". On Sunday, Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade, head of an anti-rebel task force, told Reuters the raids were \"legitimate law enforcement operations\", and authorities had search warrants for firearms and explosives. Activists said the raids were reminiscent of police operations in which thousands of people have been killed as part of Duterte's signature war on drugs, in which police said all of the victims were armed and had resisted arrest. Among those killed was a coordinator of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, a left-wing group that has called for an end to \"red-tagging\", the practice of labelling opponents communists or terrorists to justify targeting them, which dates back to the the rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Human Rights Watch said the government's counter-insurgency campaign no longer makes a distinction between armed rebels and non-combatant activists, labour leaders, and rights defenders. Since coming to power in 2016, Duterte has seen his efforts to forge peace with Maoist rebels derailed repeatedly, prompting frequent outbursts and threats to wipe them out.  \n      This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U.

Gay, St. George on Wednesday.\u00a0 The ceremony, which signalled the start of the additional work on the \u00a0houses, is a collaborative effort between both governments that will see the completion of over 300 units in the areas of Soubise in St. Andrew\u2019s, and \u00a0Mt. Gay and Frequente in St. George. The houses, which were officially handed over to the Government of Grenada on August 24, 2012 were incomplete, since the then administration was unable to provide the counterpart funding required to supply the units\u00a0with electricity, water and sewage facilities. However, on the assumption of office, the Mitchell led administration, through the Ministry of Social Development and Housing made this a priority.\u00a0 At the ceremony, Chairman of the Housing Authority of Grenada, Ashton Frame, said the Authority welcomed the generosity of the Government and people of the People\u2019s Republic of China, since housing is currently an urgent and pressing need in Grenada. He thanked the Government of Grenada for the confidence placed in the Housing Authority to manage this important project and was in high praises of the Minister of Social Development and Housing, the Hon. Delma Thomas for the pivotal role that she had played in seeking China\u2019s assistance to the complete the units. In the absence of the Hon. Delma Thomas, who is currently out of State, the Acting Minister for Social Development and Housing, Senator, the Hon. Brenda Hood applauded the Government and people of the People\u2019s Republic of China for their assistance. She also spoke of the initiatives that the Government of Grenada is undertaking to provide homes for Grenadian families. \u201cIn recognizing the importance of housing to a Constituency and being a caring and committed Government, we have heard the cries of our people and this Administration has made a request for additional housing projects.\u00a0Currently Government is finalizing the locations for these new housing projects,\u201d Senator Hood said. \u201cAdditionally, we have increased the allocation for housing repair to enable the Ministry to assist more vulnerable persons to improve their living conditions, which is a standing human right. Our Government is working diligently to ensure that Grenada has a proper housing stock for our families. The pride and joy that comes with ownership is a dream that every Grenadian should realise.\u201d The units will be brought to a full state of completion by the Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG), whose Deputy Manager says they are expected to be completed in a little over six months. Once finished, the Housing Authority of Grenada would be responsible for the distribution of the units. \u00a0The Authority is currently in the process of finalizing the eligibility criteria for the over 4,000 applicants who have already showed interest in the 351 housing units available. Applicants who do not meet the criteria for the low income housing units, may qualify for the soon-to-be-launched middle income housing project. However, some of the persons who were not successful in obtaining houses in this first distribution phase will be placed on a waiting list to be considered when the additional units are constructed. Ambassador to the People\u2019s Republic of China, Her Excellency, Ou Boqian, indicated that it is hoped that these additional units will be constructed as soon as possible.

            "text": " \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t China-backed Condor Cliff and La Barrancosa dams press ahead without a comprehensive impact study or community consultation \nTais Gadea Lara February 25, 2020\n  Share The iconic Perito Moreno glacier could be affected by the Condor Cliff and Barrancosa dams in Argentine Patagonia (image: Tais Gadea Lara) Seemingly never-ending legal and environmental wrangles over two China-backed dams in southern Argentina have failed to deter new president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez from pressing ahead with the project, which is key to unlocking more Chinese finance. In 2007, then President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who today is back in power as vice president, relaunched the Condor Cliff and La Barrancosa dams in Santa Cruz province, which were first conceived in the 1950s. Progress in the past 13 years, however, has been very slow. The latest iteration of the project, which would be 85% financed by China Development Bank, is not just an investment agreement. It is a linchpin of China-Argentina cooperation since the contract includes a \u2018cross-compliance clause\u2019 that deems its construction a prerequisite for the advance of other Chinese-financed projects in the country. Today, Argentina is facing a new economic crisis and Fern\u00e1ndez hopes to develop a closer alliance with China that will bolster currency reserves and give new impetus to infrastructure building. \u201cThis is the most important infrastructure construction work in Argentina,\" Vice President Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner said on a visit to mark the relaunch of the dams in January. \"During the previous government, the works were paralysed. Abandonment and neglect characterised that stage.\u201d     A consortium made up of Chinese majority partner Gezhouba Group Corporation and Argentine companies Electroenginier\u00eda and Hidrocuyo is in charge of delivering the dams. The government says the project will boost hydroelectric generation in Argentina by 15% and power more than 600,000 homes. \u201cWe have great faith in this project,\u201d said Ernesto Fern\u00e1ndez Taboada, executive director of the China-Argentina Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThe financing is secured from Chinese banks but some adjustments have to be made. These are two dams on the same river that take full advantage of its flow. It will be good for the province and the whole country,\u201d he added. At the end of 2016, however, Argentina's Supreme Court suspended work on the dams, ruling that a proper environmental impact assessment and public consultation be carried out. Dam opponents said they could destroy archaeological sites and negatively impact the Perito Moreno glacier, a major tourist draw for the Los Glaciares National Park. They could also could affect the course of the Santa Cruz River and water levels in the estuaries where the rare Hooded grebe, a critically endangered species endemic to Argentina, spends the winter. In the last 25 years, populations of the water-dwelling bird have dropped 80%. Today, it is estimated that fewer than 800 remain. Former President Mauricio Macri (2015-2019) responded to court rulings by scaling back the project. Instead of 11 turbines, there would be eight and the dams\u2019 height would be lowered to reduce its environmental impact. The modifications satisfied the Supreme Court, which finally green-lighted the works in September 2017. Yet there was still scant advance and complaints continued. \u201cWe have been demanding an Environmental Impact Assessment that reliably demonstrates the glaciers won\u2019t be impacted,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Marta Di Paola, research director at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN). She insists that the project\u2019s major problems remain unresolved. You cannot take risks for such delicate jobs Ignacio \u201cKini\u201d Roesler, Patagonia program coordinator for the Argentina Birds Association, said: \u201cThere are no concrete actions or tools for the conservation of the Hooded grebe\u2019s hibernating environment. The Santa Cruz River is fundamental for the conservation of the species.\" Beyond environmental groups, local communities belonging to the Mapuche and Tehuelche peoples also oppose the project. They defend the river and surrounding territory as sacred spaces and have made a formal legal claim for a consultation on the project. The law should protect them. Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, which Argentina has ratified, stipulates that governments \u201cshould consult the people whenever legislative or administrative measures are contemplated that could directly affect them\u201d. Di Paola said: \u201cThe works are moving beyond weaknesses in the environmental impact assessment to [proceeding] without the prior, free and informed consent of indigenous communities.\u201d For their supporters, the dams represent a development opportunity for Santa Cruz. The majority of the workforce is Argentine, although the management and some specialist positions are occupied by Chinese. \"You cannot take risks for such delicate jobs,\" says Fern\u00e1ndez Taboada. By 2022, the project will have created 3,000 jobs and generated further employment for those providing food, medicine and recreational services to the site. The loan for construction will be repaid by sales of power generated by the dams.     The project is part of a \u2018comprehensive strategic partnership\u2019 between China and Argentina, a diplomatic status the Asian country maintains with only a few nations. Political and economic ties between the two countries grew increasingly close over the past decade, especially under Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Argentina obtained Chinese funds for eleven projects covering railroads, solar energy, nuclear energy and dams. Argentina also benefited from a US$19 billion dollar currency swap \u2013 exchanging loans in local currencies in order to get favourable rates \u2013 which helped strengthen the Central Bank's foreign reserves. On winning office, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez publicly expressed his desire for a closer alliance with China and questioned what he saw as Macri\u2019s coolness towards the Asian country. The president affirmed his desire to relaunch curbed projects and even sign an agreement under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, China\u2019s flagship global connectivity programme designed to facilitate trade and other exchanges. That closeness, however, also generates fears. Di Paola described the commercial link as \u201ca struggle of forces between a country [China] that needs to invest, sell supplies, employ its workforce, and exploit natural resources in other parts of the world, and another (Argentina) that needs a lot of what other countries can offer.\u201d Only 9.65% of the electrical energy in Argentine territory comes from renewable sources, including hydropower. This figure is far lower than the Latin American average and from the national goal of 20% by 2025 set out in Law 27,191. The energy matrix largely consists of hydrocarbons, mainly natural gas. According to a recent FARN report, the dams will not be able to operate at 100% capacity, since the project only contemplates a number of high-power lines enough to transport 43% of the energy produced. This, coupled with environmental problems, makes the dams meaningless, FARN argues. A group of former energy secretaries said that political ties, rather than economic costs and benefits, were responsible for the approval of the dams. Instead of pushing ahead with them, Argentina should promote less expensive solar or wind energy, they argued. The former secretaries described the decision to build the dams as \u201cirresponsible\u201d and the contract award as \u201cirregular.\u201d Argentina will not be able to repay the loan for its construction, which is not accounted for in an Argentine strategic national plan for energy development, they said. \u201cGovernment efforts must focus on the generation of renewable and clean energies, towards an energy transition that is fair and inclusive,\u201d said Di Paola. \u201cThe solution is not to build the dams. It is neither a clean nor an economically sustainable project.\u201d\u00a0 Fern\u00e1ndez Taboada, however, said the benefits of the dams outweigh their impacts: \u201cProgress sometimes affects environmental conditions or individuals. The benefits that this work will bring are much greater than the small environmental damages there may be.\u201d \n            You can republish our articles for free under the Creative Commons licence.\n           \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Impacts and innovations in a key sector for China and Latin America  Mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to cleaner economies   Natural resources and responsible extraction   Bridging Latin America's infrastructure gap sustainably   The drivers, actors and institutions behind the billions  A chinadialogue partner site.\nFind out more\n Dialogo Chino uses cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

Located in central Peru, approximately 140km east of Lima in the Morococha mining district, Yauli Province, the Toromocho mine was commissioned in June 2015.\n The project produced 763,500 tons (t) of copper concentrates, including 182,288t of copper and 5.3 million ounces (Moz) of silver, in 2015.\n Construction of the Toromocho copper mine expansion project was started in June 2018, while mining is expected to be commenced in 2020. The estimated $1.35bn expansion project is proposed to be funded through internal working capital and through debt financing. The mine life of the project is expected to be 27 years.\n Minera Chinalco Peru, a subsidiary of Aluminum Corp of China (Chinalco), is developing the porphyry copper project. Chinalco acquired the Toromocho mine from Minera Peru Copper (MPC) in 2007.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Construction of the Toromocho copper mine expansion was started in June 2018.

The expansion is anticipated to increase the daily production capacity of the mine from 117,000 tons per day (tpd) to 170,000tpd. It is expected to produce 75,000 fine metric tons (FMT) of copper a year in addition to creating 3,200 construction and 2,400 operational jobs.\n The Toromocho copper mine in Morococha region is located at an altitude from 14,700ft to 16,400ft.\n The Morococha area is made up of a sequence of folded paleozoic and mesozoic rocks comprising calcareous sediments in addition to smaller volumes of intercalcated volcanic flows. The rock sequence was subject to multiple intrusions, resulting in the formation of hydrothermal mineralization.\n Classified as a copper-moly porphyry system, the copper project features both sediments and contact metamorphic skarns. Secondary enrichment process occurred at the deposit resulted in the formation of a thick zone of mixed chalcocite and chalcopyrite in the upper zones.\n The Toromocho deposit comprises a complex group of mineralized veins, veinlets, and stock works. Most of the mineralization is hosted in Jurassic limestones of the Pucara formation as well as in Tertiary intrusives such as diorites, granodiorites, quartz, monzonites, and quartz porphyries.\n The reserves at Toromocho copper mine are estimated at 1.52 billion tons of ore, grading 0.48% Cu, 0.019% Mo, and 6.88 g/t Ag.\n The Toromocho copper project currently employs conventional open-pit mining method, involving drilling and blasting. Major mining equipment used at the project include four blast hole drills, four cable shovels, 300t haul trucks, six units of DR10 track dozers, four units of 834G wheel dozers, four motor graders, and three Cat 777 frame water trucks.\n Ore is processed at the plant using conventional crushing, grinding, and flotation to produce copper and molybdenum concentrates separately.\n A heap leach facility is being used to process secondary chalcocite with high volumes of soluble copper, which comprises of high volumes of chalcocite-filled arsenic.\n The final concentrate is transported from Ferrov\u00edas Central Andina to the port of Callao in a tubular air-tight conveyer and shipped to customers.\n The processing plant is installed with a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill, ball mill, and flotation equipment to produce 1,838tpd of copper concentrates. It also includes a separate hydrometallurgical plant to extract 25.1tpd of molybdenum.\n Power is currently provided by the National Interconnected Electrical Grid through a 220kV substation at Pachachaca.\n Water supply for the Toromocho mine is collected from the Kingsmill tunnel.\n Fluor was awarded the engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) services contract for the Toromocho expansion project.\n Minera Chinalco Peru has engaged Jacobs Engineering Group for preparing the feasibility study report for the Toromocho copper expansion.\n                                    \nMiningSilverMining Equipment\n \nMining\n \nMining\n \nPowerMiningOil & Gas\n View More Get the latest energy news delivered to your inbox.

            "text": " Home / Top Featured Article / New COVID-19 variants under investigation worldwide Medical professionals around the world are currently trying to determine whether the currently available vaccines will be effective against the new strains of COVID-19 that have surfaced in recent months. At least five new variants of the virus have been reported in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and New York, and California in the United States, and Barbados have recorded at least three cases of the UK strain thus far. President of the Barbados Association of Medical Practitioners (BAMP), Dr Lynda Williams, told COVID Weekly that Barbadian doctors are concerned about strains that are resistant to the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine being offered here, saying that, \u201cIf we get the South African strain or the mutated UK one which is said to be a combination of the original, the +484 variation and the South African one, we may have difficulty controlling the virus. \u201cThe main issue with these new types is that there is not enough information available yet, so investigations are currently taking place to determine whether the vaccines will be effective against them.\u201d Dr Williams stated, \u201cWe have called for genome surveillance on these new strains. That means we are looking for changes in the genomes, or the genetic structure of the virus, in a systematic way. It does not involve testing everyone, but we will be checking their symptoms in such a way that will determine if they indeed have one of these different strains.\u201d She said the Caribbean region had asked for assistance in carrying out the surveillance and several agencies, including the Caribbean Public Health Association (CARPHA) had expressed an interest in doing so, but the Government would make the final determination on that matter.

            "text": " Since the 1970s, drivers of vehicles have been suffering regular delays due to landslides on the El Sillar highway in Bolivia, connecting Santa Cruz with Cochabamba. A section of the route suffers badly from geological instability and it has a difficult topography. A particular problem comes from the stretches with rocky slopes during the rainy season, as there are frequent rockfalls onto the road, which pose a hazard to drivers and block the highway. The section of El Sillar located between kilometres 100 and 128 of the Cochabamba - Santa Cruz route forms part of the East-West Bioceanic Corridor and crosses a number of towns belonging to Chapare Province in Cochabamba Department. Widening the route will contribute to the area\u2019s economy, providing a new transport corridor and boosting trade between Bolivia and its neighbouring countries, Brazil, Peru and Chile. This improved route will also boost connectivity for Bolivia, speeding transport between its eastern and western borders, becoming a main part of the interoceanic corridor. Likewise, it will contribute to the national development, especially to the department of Cochabamba and eastern Bolivia, since it is its main export route and links with the rest of the departments. The dual carriageway will provide better traffic flow at all times of the year, as well as reducing wear and tear on vehicles. It will also help develop the local agricultural sector, producing bananas, citrus fruits, avocado, corn and ginger. The Bolivian road authority, Administrator Bolivia de Carreteras (ABC), called for the El Sillar dual carriageway to be built to a higher standard than the existing route to improve traffic flow and reduce danger and disruptions from rockfalls. The project to upgrade the El Sillar route to a dual carriageway includes building 28 bridges, two tunnels and a number of retaining walls with a total length of 6km. These will be used to pass through the stretches suffering from landslides and rockfalls on a 30km stretch with the worst geological instability. The contract to build the El Sillar was awarded to the Chinese contractor Sinohydro Corporation for US$426 million. Work began in mid-June 2018 and it is expected that the project will be delivered in March 2021. One of the conditions of the package is that the contractor is responsible for all of the work and there are no subcontracts involved in the project. From a financial point of view, 85% of the necessary funding requirement was provided by Eximbank of China. Meanwhile, the remaining 15% has been provided on a counterpart basis by Bolivia\u2019s government. In all, the 28 bridges total 6km in length. The bridges include nine large structures, the San Jacinto, Mayu Crystal, Limatambo, Anchu Mayu, Antahuacana, Thuyu Mayu, Chuamayu and the Holy Spirit I and II bridges. These nine bridges require the installation of more than 190 piles, in difficult conditions due to the rain. The earthmoving work will be carried out in different phases that will last until 2021, and a total of 6 million m3 of earth will be moved.The first phase of the earthmoving work also includes the construction of five major structures to support the roadway. Another key element for this project has been the boring of the two tunnel stretches. One of the tunnels is 1,025m in length while the other is 765m long. The contractor, Sinohydro, started by building the portals, then bored through from the ends. These two underground routes will help boost safety for traffic travelling through the El Sillar area, particularly in the rainy season when the risk of rockfalls and landslides is at its highest. According to the new design developed by the Sinohydro engineers, the dual carriageway is being built with four 7m-wide lanes. This allows for two lanes of traffic in both directions. The design also features a 2m external berm and a central dividing strip 1m-wide. The dual carriageway is being built with both asphalt and concrete surfaces in different stretches, to best suit the conditions. The contractor, Sinohydro, commenced the project by carrying out clearing of vegetation, cutting the slopes and building necessary drainage.\u00a0"

            "text": " \n\n The construction of the new bridge has demonstrated that modernity can come to distant and isolated places while at the same time showing respect for indigenous lands, identity, and the environment.  by Xinhua writers Cui Yuanlei, Yang Chunxue, Pei Jianrong LA PAZ, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Guarani people, an indigenous group living in Bolivia's southern lowlands, have long had the dream of enjoying modern bridges and highways. Now, their dream has become reality. After more than a year of hard work, the 306-meter-long Parapeti Bridge, whose construction was led by the China Railway Group Limited (CREC), was inaugurated on Friday.   Photo taken on Feb. 7, 2020 shows the opening ceremony of the Parapeti Bridge on the under-construction El Espino-Charagua-Boyuibe Highway in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. (Xinhua/Xin Yuewei) IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE Before the construction of the Parapeti Bridge, the locals had to use an old small bridge that connected various Guarani communities in the area. Safety issues had troubled many for decades. Now, running parallel to the old bridge, the new Parapeti Bridge over the Parapeti River boasts wider roads and a sturdier construction, said Mario Perez, an engineer and a bridge specialist. Head Chief of the Guarani communities in the area, Eugenio Vitingay, said that the Parapeti Bridge will replace the old one that had been an essential part of local infrastructure. \"The most dangerous thing was to cross the old bridge, and now we feel safer with the new bridge,\" Vitingay said.  A car runs on the old bridge in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Feb. 6, 2020. (Xinhua/Xin Yuewei) Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the new bridge, Chinese Ambassador to Bolivia Huang Yazhong said that the bridge symbolizes the friendship between the peoples of China and Bolivia. \"With the completion of the bridge, the local people can now cross the Parapeti River at ease and from now on, they no longer have to walk on the unsafe and unsustainable bridges that involve high risks,\" Huang added. The Parapeti Bridge is one of the four longest bridges of the El Espino-Charagua-Boyuibe Highway project, a flagship project within the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Now nearly 50 percent completed, according to the Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC), the 160-km El Espino-Charagua-Boyuibe Highway will directly link the country's eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija with each other and with neighboring Paraguay and Argentina.   Aerial photo taken on Feb. 6, 2020 shows the Parapeti Bridge on the under-construction El Espino-Charagua-Boyuibe Highway in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. (Xinhua/Xin Yuewei) DREAM COMES TRUE \"We have always wished, as an indigenous area, for highways and modern bridges,\" Salomon Torrez, head of the local San Antonio community, told Xinhua. \"We are happy that this project of great magnitude and this modern bridge pass right through our area, because it will help our impoverished people get better,\" said Torrez. For Vitingay, the construction of the new bridge has demonstrated that modernity can come to distant and isolated places while at the same time showing respect for indigenous lands, identity, and the environment. The indigenous coordinator between CREC and the community of Ipitakuape, Juan Pinto, said that the bridge is very important for local inhabitants, not only as a means of transportation, but also because 85 percent of the labor for the project was drawn from the local population. \"The dream has been fulfilled,\" said Pinto.   Local kids pose for a group photo at the opening ceremony of the Parapeti Bridge on the under-construction El Espino-Charagua-Boyuibe Highway in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Feb. 7, 2020. (Xinhua/Xin Yuewei) According to Enrique Concepcion, the ABC's regional manager for Santa Cruz, the highway is a high-impact infrastructure project that has brought benefits to communities along the route by hiring local workers. The CREC will also lead the construction of two other bridges in Saipuru and Cuevo, both in the Santa Cruz department. The bridges will also make up part of the El Espino-Charagua-Boyuibe Highway project.  BENEFITING PEOPLE Juan Pablo Saucedo, an economist and professor at Nur University of Bolivia, said that infrastructure is one of Bolivia's weakest areas and that China is a crucial partner in improving Bolivia's infrastructure. \"The development of infrastructure is very important for Bolivia at all levels,\" he said, adding that the highway is a way of providing access to centers of production and generating direct and indirect employment. Saucedo believed that the BRI allows countries to diversify trade and to increase investment, tourism, and cultural exchanges through infrastructure building. He said the idea is welcomed and shared by cooperation partners under the framework.   Aerial photo taken on Feb. 6, 2020 shows the old bridge (top) and the Parapeti Bridge on the under-construction El Espino-Charagua-Boyuibe Highway in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. (Xinhua/Xin Yuewei) As to CREC's efforts to preserve the environment and the approximately 30 indigenous communities living near the highway zone, Saucedo said that investment partners must take the issue of preservation into account and the preservation efforts by the Chinese company should be commended. According to the ABC, the highway project, which runs through a productive agricultural area, is being carried out using up-to-date environmental standards in order to limit its impact on the environment. As an international public good based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation, the BRI is a welcome formula for Latin America. So far, Chinese companies have undertaken 20 highway projects throughout Bolivia with a total of more than 1,500 kilometers, which can not only improve Bolivia's transportation infrastructure and connectivity in all regions, but also the living standards and economic and social benefits of the people.  \u25a0 (Video reporters: Pei Jianrong, Wu Hao, Kang Wenjun; Video editor: Ma Ruxuan)"

            "text": " MONDAY NEWS HIT - After several months of remote learning only, the Detroit public school district\u00a0is reopening its classrooms for in-person learning.\u00a0 The district used several benchmarks before it gave the green light for students and teachers to return to learning centers. \"When pandemic infection rates in the City climbed beyond the five percent mark in November, we made the proactive decision to suspend in-person learning until rates declined in order to keep our students and employees as safe as possible,\" said DPSCD Superintendent Nikolai Vitti.\u00a0 Students enrolled at Detroit public schools who have been cooped up in their home since November now have the option to return to the classroom Monday when teaching in-person resumes. With positive test rates in the city around 3.5% and the availability of vaccine supplies increasing in the coming weeks, the district is allowing kids to come back for in-class learning. \"A lot of our babies don't learn well virtually, right? Some of them aren't motivated the same, they don't grasp the same information and so hearing their cry out of just needing to be in school and to be educated, we're now able to provide that again,\" said Sakina Bolden, the principal of Detroit International Academy for Young Women. The decision to return to class has the support the teachers union, which was among the biggest opponents to opening learning centers over the previous summer.\u00a0Teachers who work in-person will receive $750 in hazard pay for each quarter they work.\u00a0 While there isn't a current mandate for getting vaccinated, all faculty must test negative for COVID-19 before entering the building. Anyone inside must wear face masks. Virtual learning is also still available.\u00a0 The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services increased vaccine eligibility on March 8 to include anyone age 50 and older with pre-existing conditions and caregivers who assist children with special health needs. Encouraging news about vaccine supplies mixed with progress inoculating elderly residents prompted the expansion. Residents who are homeless are also now eligible for a vaccine. And it won't take long before the goalposts get moved again when residents without comorbidities are also included in two more weeks. So far about 900,000 residents\u00a0or 11% of the state is fully protected from COVID-19. The state wants to vaccinate 70% of its residents over the age of 16 by the end of the year.\u00a0 The constant fear of getting infected, the forced isolation, the effort to avoid face-to-face contact - doctors say we all managed the trauma at the time pretty well. But it's the months afterward that took their toll on people. The first full year of pot sales went through the roof. Comfort food became a pantry norm. And alcohol consumption climbed above average. All these vices and more weighed heavily on public health as the population found ways to mitigate the coronavirus. They're also likely to have far-reaching consequences for our bodies as the number of liver problems identified in people ballooned in younger populations. Drinking and driving numbers also went up. The rate of addictions to drugs and sex also escalated. \"During the trauma,\u00a0we manage pretty well. What is going to happen is 6 months after everything has settled. That is when we will see the problem. That will be the post-traumatic stress,\" said Dan O'Neil, a psychologist. Fox 2s Dave Spencer explores how people coped with COVID in 2020 The community welcomed an ex-convict back into society on Sunday after he spent\u00a0more than two-and-a-half decades for a crime he never should have been convicted of. Larry Smith was released from prison last month after serving 26 years for a murder he was convicted of at age 18. He said the hopelessness he felt behind bars made him want to die due to the pressure.\u00a0 But his family never gave up on his fight for freedom. They used a private investigator to help showcase evidence exonerated Smith. Pastor Terrence Devizen of the United Kingdom Church put on a ceremony for Smith and 30 other exonerees.\u00a0 \"I am saddened to some degree that they lost so much of their lives based on a bunch of lies that were told and wrongfully convicted and then the other reaction is I\u2019m excited all over again because they have a new start,\" says Devezin.\u00a0 Terrence Devezin Pastor of United Kingdom church welcomes home Larry Smith who was exonerated last month after spending 26 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Another round of road closures that will persist for much of the year went into effect Monday on I-75. Northbound I-75 will be limited to a single left lane\u00a0from Big Beaver to Wattles roads at 7 a.m. while all ramps at the Big Beaver interchange will be closed. Several other exit and entrance ramps further south near 9 and 8 Mile are also closed for phase 2 of the I-75 improvement project. It's going to be 58 degrees today - yes, the warmest day of the year. And more of that is on the way with some expected rain later in the week. Near 60 each afternoon through Thursday! In a wide-ranging interview aired Sunday, Harry and Meghan described painful discussions about the color of their son\u2019s skin, losing royal protection and the intense pressures that led the Duchess of Sussex to contemplate suicide. The interview with Oprah Winfrey was the couple\u2019s first since they stepped down from royal duties and the two-hour special included numerous revelations. Harry told Winfrey that he felt trapped by royal life and was surprised that he was cut off financially and lost his security last year. He also said he felt his family did not support Meghan, who acknowledged her naivete about royal life before marrying Harry, as she endured media attacks and false stories. Advertisement Meghan, who is biracial, described that when she was first pregnant with son Archie, there were \"concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he\u2019s born.\" The statement led Winfrey to ask \"What,\" incredulously and sit in silence for a moment.

            "text": " Prince Harry finally cleared the air around speculations on his relationship with his family members in his recent interview with Oprah Winfrey. He revealed that things are not too well between him and his father Prince Charles. The Duke of Sussex said that he will always love his father, but is \"disappointed\" in him. Harry said he had spoken to Prince Charles twice before making the official announcement of his and Meghan Markle's exit as senior members of the British royal family in January last year, but then the heir apparent to the British throne \"stopped taking his calls\" and asked him to put it in \"writing,\" reports CBS. The father-son duo are on better terms since then, but Harry says there is still \"a lot to work through there.\" \"I feel really let down because he's been through something similar and he knows what pain feels like and Archie's his grandson. But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship,\" he said. As for his brother Prince William, Harry reiterated his previous statement that they love each other but are on different paths. He told Oprah: \"As I've said before, I love William to bits \u2014 he's my brother and we've been through hell together and we have a shared experience but we're on different paths. Our relationship is 'space' at the moment. And time heals all things, hopefully.\" When Oprah asked Harry if he would have stepped back from royal duties were it not for Meghan, he said he wouldn't have as he didn't know he was trapped. He also said that he believes his father and brother, future heirs to the throne, are also \"trapped within the system,\" like the rest of their family. The Duke also denied the reports that he left his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, blindsided about his announcement of his exit as a working royal, and revealed he had spoken to her three times. He also said that the Queen is his \"colonel-in-chief\" and she always will be, and in fact, they have spoken more since his exit than they ever did before. \"I've spoken more to my grandmother in the last year than I have done for many, many years. My grandmother and I have a really good relationship. And an understanding. And I have a deep respect for her,\" he said. Harry and Meghan have made some quite shocking revelations in the interview, including that there were concerns in the palace about the skin colour of their son Archie before he was born. \"In the months when I was pregnant, all around the same time, so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born,\" Meghan said, refusing to divulge who were having these discussions with her husband. The former American actress said that the \"idea of the first member of colour in the royal family not being titled\" brought a lot of pain to her, not because of convection but because of safety. She was worried about her son's security especially because of her own interactions with the British media. In fact, the couple said that their immediate departure for Canada after the end of their final round of royal engagements in London was because their security detail was taken away from them on \"short notice\" due to their \"change in status.\" Pictures of their home in Canada then made it to the news, after which they decided to leave for America. Harry added that he was cut off financially by the palace in the first quarter of 2020, even though their exit deal promised them support until they get settled down, and this is why they had to sign lucrative deals with companies including Netflix and Spotify. \"That (deal) was suggested by somebody else by the point of where my family literally cut me off financially, and I had to afford security for us,\" Harry said, adding: \"I've got what my mum left me, and without that, we would not have been able to do this.\" Meghan said that they considered several options for their career, as Harry added, \"from my perspective, all I needed was enough money to be able to pay for security to keep my family safe.\" \"I never thought I would have my security removed, because I was born in to this position,\" he said. \"I inherited the risk. So that was a shock to me,\" Harry said about the situation. Meghan said that she even wrote to her in-laws requesting to keep her \"husband safe\" even if she and her son's security are \"not a priority,\" but was told it isn't possible.  \u201cClosing the gap between the promise of AI and its implementation"

            "text": " \n\tIf 600 million more women were connected to the Internet over the next three years, global GDP would rise between $13 billion and $18 billion, said a new report by Zain Group, a regional leader in the mobile telecom sector.\n\n\tThe report \u201cWomen in Technology - Bridging the Gender Gap in STEM Fields\u201d provides insights on the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), highlighting the impact on socio-economic development across the board.\n\n\tThe release of the report, which coincides with International Women\u2019s Day, explores several important issues regarding the cause, nature, and effects of the challenges faced by women as related to STEM, and the prejudices they face even upon entering professions related to the subject area.\n\n\tBader Al-Kharafi, Zain Vice-Chairman and Group CEO said: \"The role of women in tech needs to be increased. It is that simple. Zain is continually driving equality programs, recognizing the need to push an agenda that is cohesive, inclusive, and fair to all. This thought leadership report is another tool to highlight the extent of the exclusion of women from STEM-related fields, and what is needed to close the gender gap across the region and beyond.\n\n\t\u201cSince the launch of our Gender Diversity initiative, we have invested in certifying over 100 females within Zain on the fundamentals of Data Analytics and Science. These colleagues then went on to take part in our group wide 12-hour datathon in April 2020 at the height of pandemic, and are now part of a talent pool of resources we tap into for tech related projects across our footprint. WE will continue to inspire learning through practice, and the engagement in this datathon has proven the resilience of our talented pool of women in STEM.\u201d\n\n\tJennifer Suleiman, Zain Group\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer said: \u201cZain has a long list of activities aimed at reducing the gender gap. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted glaring inequalities across so many aspects of modern life, and the plight of females in STEM-related fields is one of them. The timing and topic of our latest report that coincides with International Women\u2019s Day couldn\u2019t be more appropriate, and we hope it forces people to recognize the state of play when it comes to gender exclusion and the steps required to rectify it.\u201d\n\n\tThis latest and insightful thought leadership encompasses issues related to gender biases in STEM; innovation in STEM; developing STEM skills to achieve financial inclusion; and Covid-19 and women in technology. Core areas of discussion and highlights in the report include:\n\n\tAspects of Gender Disparity\n\n\tWomen account for half of the world\u2019s population and are fundamental to ensuring a sustainable future and peaceful societies. There has been some progress made towards achieving a more equal society, however, there is still a long way to go and according to the UN, the gender gap is considered \u201cthe unfinished business of our time.\u201d\n\n\tThe Gender Digital Divide \n\tStudies have shown that the gender digital divide is due to the lack of access females have in attaining digital skillsets that can help them advance and develop in the area. Additionally, women are more likely to represent lower income segments, leaving them unable to afford and purchase digital software and hardware.\n\n\tGlaring discrepancies exist with regards females gaining access to digital tools, including:\n\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0165 million fewer women own a mobile phone in comparison to men\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Globally, 433 million women are unconnected\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The global internet user gap is 17%\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If 600 million more women were connected to the internet over the next three years, global GDP would rise between $13 billion and $18 billion\n\n\tLiteracy and STEM Education\n\n\tAs the number of girls gaining an education increases, disparities associated with access to opportunities, quality and topics they choose to study becomes more evident. It is imperative for girls to further develop themselves in STEM education, as careers in these areas are seen as the jobs of the future, driving innovation, social well-being, inclusive growth, and sustainable development.\n\n\tZain Bahrain\u2019s Girls for Tech Camp, for example, was launched in partnership with the Kingdom\u2019s Supreme Council for Women and Clever Play, an organization that aims to inspire children\u2019s curiosity and passion for STEM. Established in October 2019, the program equips girls between ages 8 and 13 years with 10 hours of training in coding, and targets training 1,000 girls. In 2019-2020, 725 girls completed the program.\n\n\tEmployment Equality\n\n\tWomen are underrepresented in the technology sector and even though large strides have been made in STEM education, it has not translated into employment. Studies have shown that even though countries have largely invested in improving girls\u2019 education including STEM education, cultural and societal constraints have hindered this needed transition, impacting societies in a dramatic manner. This gap in STEM employment prevents economies from reaching their full potential as it omits half of the population\u2019s potential and talent to contribute to the economy.\n\n\tGender Biases in STEM\n\n\tGender stereotypes in the context of STEM start at an early age and continue to impact children at later stages in their lives. It has been studied that children\u2019s choices to enter STEM start as early as 3-5 years of age. By the ages of 6-10 years, girls start developing the notion that boys are better in math, which is not the case, as analyses show girls and boys in fact perform the same. Another stereotype that starts to emerge during this time is that males innately succeed in the field of STEM. These stereotypes continue to manifest throughout the course of women\u2019s education and career.\n\n\tInnovation in STEM\n\n\tSTEM plays a key role in creating innovative tools to address global challenges that our world faces. It has been proven that diversity in teams drives transformation as it brings about new ideas and perspectives. As men and women have different life experiences that lead to varied perspectives, such diversity in viewpoints triggers creativity and improves results. Merging STEM and diversity creates phenomenal growth opportunities.\n\n\tDeveloping STEM Skills to Achieve Financial Inclusion\n\n\tTechnology and digital services are seen as tools that can be used to enable development. When used to progress development, technology can be extremely transformational and improve social and economic outcomes. Such tools could also be used to improve distribution in addition to promoting inclusivity, increasing accessibility and allocating resources. With that being said, it is important for marginalized and disadvantaged segments to leverage tools that help elevate their standards of living and increase their access to services.\n\n\tCovid-19 and Women in Technology \n\tA needs assessment conducted by UN agencies highlighted that households led by women had less access to the internet than those led by males during these times of Covid-19. In addition, only 41% of women-led households claimed that their children had access to online websites created by ministries of education that supported the continuation of learning in comparison to 56% of male-led households.\n\n\tIn addition to learning inequalities, the increase of violence during lockdowns is extremely alarming as females are left vulnerable to dire situations. Digital advancements such as instant messaging with geolocation functions, domestic abuse hotlines, and disguised apps that provide discreet information for survivors in case their abusers continue to track them, can play a pivotal role in saving the lives of women. \u2013 TradeArabia News Service  Tags:\n"

What was called in was there was a shoplifter at Cumberland Farms Early Saturday morning, The one on 1st street, But the shoplifting incident turned out to be something much more than that. During the interaction with the male subject, it was learned he had two outstanding warrants for his arrest. Upon hearing this, the male subject took off running. With the quick action of Officer's Coffey and Conklin, the foot pursuit did not last long. In the course of apprehending the male subject, officers observed him throw his belly bag, which was later recovered by the officers. The bag contained 700 individual bags of a powdered substance believed to be heroin. Also inside the bag was approximately 56 grams of crack and powdered cocaine, a scale, and bags commonly used for drug distribution. The subject is currently is being held on bail and is scheduled for arraignment in Berkshire District Court this Monday, March 8th. Some residents of Pittsfield say they should not be open 24/7, the reason being criminal activities in and around Cumberland farms on first street at night and that the Pittsfield Police Department are called there quite often.  Should Their hours be restricted as every other business in Pittsfield is held responsible for the activities in their parking lot.

            "text": " March 8 (UPI) -- On International Women's Day on Monday, if we wish any further evidence of the misogynist lunacy of the Iranian mullahs, then we should look no further than the news that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has ordered that cartoon character women must wear the hijab. Now, in Iran, even animated female characters in cartoons cannot reveal their hair. It would be amusing, if it wasn't so serious. Women's dress codes are under constant scrutiny. They must wear the hijab and \"morality police\" are on relentless patrol to enforce the law. Women, particularly young women, are singled out for brutal attacks for the \"crime\" of mal-veiling.\n  Girls who were deemed to be improperly dressed in the street have suffered horrific acid attacks and stabbings in assaults openly condoned by the mullahs. Teenage girls, arrested for the offense of posting videos of themselves dancing or singing on social media have been publicly flogged. Young female students attending end-of-term parties have been fined and beaten. This is what gender equality looks like in Iran today. The hanging of a 23-year-old woman in Ardabil Prison on Feb. 22 took the toll of women executed by the Iranian regime to at least 113 so far during the presidency of Hassan Rouhani, a supposed moderate. Most of these women were executed for killing an abusive husband or partner.\n  But this is actually another example of how the regime fails women, because they are mostly victims of domestic abuse who kill in defense of themselves or their children, because they have no legal recourse to end a violently cruel marriage. These killings often occur after women have suffered years of humiliation, insults, beatings and even torture by abusive husbands from whom they have no escape...no right to divorce. In other countries, they would be granted leniency based on their circumstances, but not in Iran. And this, of course, does not even touch upon those executed for crimes that are not capital offenses under international law, like drug offenses, or for non-crimes, like political activism. Iran is the world leader in executions per capita, as well as executions of women and juvenile offenders. Over 4,300 people have been executed since Rouhani took power in 2013, with the number of overall executions and those of women actually believed to be much higher because of the fact that most executions take place in secret, without witnesses. There are approximately 40 million women in the Islamic Republic of Iran, over half under the age of 30. Women make up more than 50% of university students, but, because of discrimination and blatant sexism creating obstacles to employment, they accounted for only 19% of Iran's workforce, even before the pandemic brought the economy to a shuddering halt. At a time when women in the West have achieved political, economic, personal and social equality, Iranian women are among the most repressed in the world, ruled by a regime dominated by elderly, bearded misogynists.\n  But young Iranian women are becoming increasingly engaged in the growing opposition to the mullahs' corrupt regime. They are joining the resistance units that are springing up in every town and city in Iran. In the nationwide uprisings that have taken place, tens of thousands of courageous female teachers, medical staff, nurses, students, factory workers and pensioners have taken to the streets to demand an end to corruption, an end to discrimination and repression and an end to the clerical regime's aggressive military adventurism across the Middle East. The mass protests are continuing, even as the coronavirus rages across Iran, killing more than 225,000 so far. Hundreds of women have been among those killed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the regime's Gestapo, and thousands more have been arrested . In the theocratic fascist dictatorship, the Iranian penal code is designed to enable men to discipline women and girls if they fail to conform to strict Islamic codes. The theocratic dictatorship in Iran has a history of targeting women with oppressive laws that would not be tolerated in the West or indeed in most civilized countries in the world. In Iran, women are considered the property of their closest male relative and have no legal rights. Girls of 9 can be married off by their parents. A woman's evidence in court is worth only half that of a man. Women may not seek to have a man charged with rape unless they have four independent witnesses. All family relationships are strictly controlled by Shariah law. Homosexual behavior, adultery, sex outside marriage, are all prohibited. Women accused of such behavior can incur severe punishments, including beatings and death, sometimes by stoning.\n  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the first supreme leader of Iran after the 1979 revolution and the father of Islamic fundamentalism, stated that equality between women and men was \"in fundamental violation of some of the most crucial rulings of Islam and in defiance of some of the explicit commandments of the Koran.\" Immediately following the revolution, Khomeini abolished the \"Family Protection Law\" that gave women family rights. He also cancelled social services for women and abolished the role of female judges in Iran's justice system. Today, only 6% of members of parliament in Iran are women. Today, Iranian women are at the forefront of the resistance to the theocratic dictatorship. Indeed, the main democratic opposition movement, the PMOI/MEK is led by a woman, the charismatic Maryam Rajavi. Brave women are routinely joining their brothers to demand regime change and an end to the misogyny and repression that has terrorized not only the Iranian people for the past four decades, but a vast part of the Middle East as well. Addressing an International Women's Day conference, Malala Yousafzai said: \"We realize the importance of our voice when we are silenced.\" Well the women of Iran are no longer prepared to be silenced. They will be heard and their cry for freedom and democracy will resonate around the world.\n  Struan Stevenson is the coordinator of the Campaign for Iran Change.

A password will be e-mailed to you. \n\n\nFrontPageAfrica - Liberia's Leading News Magazine\n\n Monrovia \u2014 Former Defense Minister Brownie Samukai faced another hurdle in taking his seat as Lofa County\u2019s senator last week when the Supreme Court of Liberia temporarily halted his certification by the National Election Commission (NEC). The nation\u2019s highest court\u2019s decision against Samukai, of the Collaborating Political Parties (CPP), was trigged by a Writ of Prohibition filed March 2,2021, by O\u2019Neil Passewe, chair of the Movement for Progressive Change. Passewe asked the court to halt the certification of Samukai because he has been convicted by the Supreme Court for the crime of money laundering. Associate Justice Joseph N. Nagbe, who issued the writ, has planned a conference in the justice chambers for 2 p.m. Tuesday, March 9, 2021, to discuss the case. Samukai received the most votes in the December 8, 2020 Senatorial election. Of the 11 candidates who vied for the Lofa County senatorial seat, Samukai received 20, 431 votes, followed by Independent candidate Cllr. Joseph Jallah with 13,968 votes. Samukai has experienced mixed rulings with the Supreme Court since he won the senatorial seat in Lofa. On February 24, 2021, the Supreme Court of Liberia ruled in Samukai\u2019s favor in the electoral dispute case filed by three of his rivals, claiming irregularities and fraud in Lofa County District No. 4. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Samukai and mandated to the NEC to proceed with the matter. On February 8, 2021, the Supreme Court upheld a criminal court\u2019s verdict in the corruption case involving Samukai and a former deputy minister and the former Comptroller at the Ministry of Defense. On March 24, 2020, the Criminal Court \u201cC\u2019\u2019 found Samukai, Joseph F. Johnson and former Deputy Minister for Administration and J. Nyumah Dorkor, former Comptroller of the Ministry of Defense guilty of misappropriating US$1.3 million from the Armed Forces compulsory contributing fund that was deposited at Ecobank Liberia. Samukai and his lawyers appealed the case. In his ruling issued last week, Judge Yamie Gbeisay, said the government did not produce sufficient evidence to convict Samukai and his two deputy ministers of money laundering and economic sabotage. But the Supreme Court in its decision upholding the lower court\u2019s guilty verdict said all public officials and employees shall obey all lawful instructions issued to them by their supervisors and they shall be held liable and responsible for acts of commission or omission as in the case of the corruption verdict. The court found: \u2018\u2019That the defendant is guilty of misuse of public fund when he disposes, use, or transfer any interest or property which is entrusted to him as of.\u00a0 That there is unrefuted evidence gathered from the record of this case that the soldiers of the AFL compulsory contributed to the fund in the AFL pension account established at Ecobank Liberia LTD therefore the said account is not a public account intended for the ministry of national defense. That there is evidence from the record showed that defendant Samukai over fiduciary of the soldiers of the AFL pension account. Wherefore in view of the foregoing, the final judgement of the trial court judge is hereby affirmed with modification[MS1]\u00a0. Samukai and his co-defendants are sentenced to serve up to two years in jail or pay the $1.3 million[MS2]\u00a0. The Supreme Court ruled that the sentence will be suspended if the defendants shall restitute the full amount of USD 1,147,456.35 or 50% thereof within the period of six months and plan with the court to pay the remaining portion in one year. Failure to pay will result in the defendants\u2019 incarceration in the common jail and there in until the full amount is paid or liquidated at the rate of 25 USD per month as provided by law, the Supreme Court ruled. The National Election Commission was expected to certify Samukai on last week but put the certification on hold because of the court\u2019s ruling. NEC\u2019s Chair Mrs. Davidetta Browne Lansanah, informed Mr. Samukai, and his lawyers that he would be certificated later.  \nLiberia: Sen. Dillon, Daniel Sando Suspended from Liberty\u2026 \n  \nLiberia: ANC Stalwart Arrested for Allegedly Posting\u2026 \n  \nLiberia: Musa Bility Warns CPP of Revising Framework\u2026 \n Sources at the NEC told FrontPage Africa that Samukai\u2019s certification was postponed because the commissioners could not agree on the letter from Justice Minister Frank Musah Dean ordering the commission to halt the certification based on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the corruption verdict. But the Supreme Court on last week ruled that Samukai should be certificated. On February 24, 2021, the Supreme Court of Liberia ruled in favor of CPP candidate Brownie Samukai in an electoral dispute case where three of his rivals claimed that there were Election irregularities and fraud in Lofa County District #4. But the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Samukai and sent the mandate to the NEC to proceed with the matter. Samukai and his co-defendants represented by Cllr. G. Wiefueh Alfred Saye, Cllrs. J. Augustine Toe and Ruth Jappah pleaded not guilty to the indictment charges. The defendants said they Ministry of Defense authorized the expenditure of funds from the soldiers\u2019 welfare without the requisite consent of the AFL\u2019s highest in command; and that all monies spent on military personnel welfare should not have been handled by and through the government normal budgetary appropriation and not from the AFL account[MS3]\u00a0.\u201d \u2018Victim of political witch hunt\u2019 Residents of Lofa County have denounced the move as the \u201csingle greatest witch hunt of a politician\u201d under the presidency of George Mannah Weah. According to a group of Lofa residents under the banner Movement Lofa Citizens in Solidarity with Samukai, the aim of all this is intended to \u201cdisgrace, intimidate and dehumanize Samukai through a mere propaganda and sensational court case\u201d. \u201cWe are equally very disappointed and frustrated in the ruling handed down against Samukai. We, therefore, term this as politically-driven and a witch hunt against our leader,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said. \u201cDocument showing payment of medical bills for Armed Forces of Liberia Sergeant, Titus, who got wounded in peacekeeping mission in Mali and was flown to India for medical treatment, which cost over US$ 100, 000 was paid and further payments made for his upkeep,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said. \u00a0\u201cTitus was dying and he was a soldier wounded in the process of serving his country. Would you have loved him to die, what if Titus were the Chief Justice\u2019s son or the president\u2019s son? How can the former minister of defense pay such a money, if this is not witch-hunt?\u2019 Addressing reporters, the citizens said the dossier containing the allegations of the misapplication of pension funds of the Armed Forces of Liberia was a hoax which had been dreamt up by the Executive Branch to harm the reputation of Samukai. \u201cBrownie Samukai has never been involved in any act of corruption since 30 years when he started working in public service. We see him as an innocent victim of a politically motivated and selective justice case,\u201d said\u00a0 the group\u2019s statement. The group claimed the ruling against Samukai is more political than legal because of his reported refusal to join the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) of President Weah prior to the December 8 Special Senatorial Election.\u00a0 \u201cBefore the election last year the CDC made several attempts to lure Samukai to the CDC but he refused and that\u2019s why angering the Executive Branch through the Supreme Court to dehumanize our Senator-elect,\u201d the group said. The target of most of the citizens\u2019 anger was Liberia\u2019s Supreme Court, which the group accused of being out to disgrace Samukai.\u00a0 \u201cThe manner in which the Judiciary Branch of our Government has been dispensing Justice in recent years, especially under the Weah-led government, has made Liberians to question the neutrality and integrity of that body,\u201d the group said.\u00a0 \u201cDuring the trial, the Defense argued that they were authorized by the former president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, then Commander-in-Chief of the AFL and presented an authorization letter to the effect. How then the former minister of defense was guilty of executing the order of the Commander-in Chief\u201d? \u201cLet the word go forth that we, the thousands of Lofa citizens who believe in the Senator-elect and voted him overwhelmingly wish to inform the Supreme Court that we are against the ruling\u201d Much of the group\u2019s 900-word rants against President Weah appeared to be resolved around warning the president \u201cnot to temper with the peace being enjoyed by Liberians\u201d. \u00a0[MS1]Is this from the supreme court? Please verify. The way you wrote it, I am not sure if its from criminal court c, the lower court of supreme court. \u00a0[MS2]Please verify. \u00a0[MS3]I do not understand this thing. Can you paraphrase it without the quotes? Please explain, I do not want to say the wrong thing. Is it that the ministry authorized the use of the funds, but did not seek the consent of AFL? So, they were authorized, but what is the explanation of the last sentence. Explain it clearly. You should know this more than me since you been reporting it.

A model that predicts the state will be reporting around 3,000 daily coronavirus cases by March-end was also discussed in another meeting earlier, a Punjab government statement read.Punjab, which has the second highest active cases in the country after Maharashtra, reported over a thousand coronavirus cases last Friday after a lull of over three months.The Centre had rushed high-level multidisciplinary public health teams to Maharashtra and Punjab last week over the surge in coronavirus cases.\"Dr Mandeep Bhandari, Joint Secretary to Government of India, who had recently visited Punjab as head of the Central team along with Dr Lakshmi from PGIMER, shared their observations that the COVID-19 spread in Punjab is not just specific to schools alone as other places are also affected, and the primary reason for surge in cases in the state is because people are not following Covid-appropriate behaviors and not religiously abiding the protocols,\" the statement read.In a similar meeting in which Punjab Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan was also present, a senior official shared data on some super-spreader events like marriages, social gatherings and offices that resulted in greater exposure and increased positivity.The official \"also appraised the Chief Secretary regarding a model which predicts a huge surge in the number of cases starting mid-March to 3000 cases per day by the end of March.\"During the meeting, the possible steps to tackle the surge were also discussed. India on Monday reported 18,599 fresh cases.   The Centre has said that six states - Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu \u2013 account for 86.25 percent of the new cases.

We encourage you to republish China Dialogue articles, online or in print, under the Creative Commons license. Please read our republishing guidelines to get started.    G\u00e9nesis Lozano    August 21, 2019June 22, 2020 Ecuador\u2019s construction of large Chinese-financed hydropower plants over the past decade was expected to rid the country of power shortages and provide surplus power for export to neighbouring countries. But delays, accidents and high costs have left Ecuador struggling to repay its Chinese creditors. Former president Rafael Correa announced that Ecuador would build eight new hydro plants by 2016 at a total cost of some US$6 billion. Jorge Glas, then minister of strategic sectors, was responsible for the master plan. He was\u00a0later jailed\u00a0in 2017 as part of the continent-wide corruption scandal involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. Only the Odebrecht-built Manduriacu plant was inaugurated on schedule, in 2015. The other seven projects due in 2016\u00a0missed deadlines due to engineering and environmental problems. The projects are either partially or wholly owned by Chinese contractors. They\u2019ve been beset with accidents, resulting in the deaths of 26 Ecuadorean and Chinese workers. Today, only four of those seven projects are operational, providing about 2.5 gigawatts of capacity. Ecuador depends mostly on coal-fired power but its commitment to increase the share of hydropower, up 35% with the new hydro projects, will allow the country to significantly reduce its carbon emissions. Coca Codo Sinclair, Ecuador\u2019s largest hydroelectric plant, which was due to begin operations in 2012, has experienced financing problems, strikes by workers demanding better conditions from contractor Sinohydro, and accidents such as the December 2014\u00a0collapse\u00a0of a pressure well that claimed 14 lives. The plant, eventually inaugurated at the beginning of 2016, has visible fissures in its water distributors, owing to the use of unsuitable materials, according to a report by the Comptroller\u2019s Office. According to the Electric Corporation of Ecuador\u00a0(Celec), which will operate the plant, repair work will last approximately one year and the costs will be borne by the contractor. \u201cEcuador will definitively not take over the plant until all the works permitting Coca Codo Sinclair to operate normally have been carried out,\u201d Celec wrote in an email to\u00a0Di\u00e1logo Chino. In the case of the three plants that comprise the Mazar Dudas complex, only Alaz\u00e1n is operating. In 2015, Celec unilaterally terminated the construction contract with China National Electric Engineering Company (CNEEC) for non-compliance. According to the most recent data on Celec\u2019s website, construction of the engine room and the electromechanical assembly of the second San Antonio power plant were planned for 2018. Re-engineering studies for the third Dudas power plant were also scheduled for 2018. The Quijos project also experienced problems due to CNEEC\u2019s non-compliance with technical standards, according to Celec documents. This led Celec to terminate the contract in December 2015. A\u00a0mediation process is currently underway between the state attorney\u2019s office and the Chinese firm. In an emergency declaration, Celec ended up awarding the assigning works to local company Proyaben S.A. in 2016 and 2017.  \u201cThey couldn\u2019t make any progress as there were geological problems. No matter how many studies you do, the studies are merely superficial,\u201d said Marco Valencia, undersecretary for Electricity Generation and Transmission at Ecuador\u2019s energy ministry. \u201cGeophysical and geological analyses may be carried out, but the moment you enter with the drilling machinery in hand, you are hit with the reality of the rock itself. In those two projects [Mazar Dudas and Quijos], we encountered geological problems like these, and the contractor could not fulfil their obligations.\u201d The Toachi Pilat\u00f3n project is also in a state of paralysis. Construction was ahead of schedule, according to Celec\u2019s 2018 stocktake. In this phase, several foreign companies were involved, including Odebrecht, which was later expelled from the country by the government. In 2010, Celec hired China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWEC) for the civil construction and the Russian company Inter RAO UES to supply electromechanical equipment. Faced with constant delays, Correa ordered the termination of the builders\u2019 contract in December 2016. After one-and-a-half years with no progress, on 22 May 2018 Russian contractor Tyazhmash S.A. was awarded the contract to complete works. In 2018, Ecuador produced approximately 23,000 gigawatt hours, most of which powered the country\u2019s homes, industries and public buildings. Hydropower generated 85% of that energy, according to Valencia.  With the new hydroelectric plants in operation, Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s government has provided assurances that greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced, due to the decrease in the consumption of fossil fuels in thermoelectric plants. \u201cSince they began operating, each year we have seen a reduction of three million tonnes of carbon dioxide,\u201d Valencia said. According to the undersecretary, in 2014 and 2015 \u2013 the years with the highest thermoelectric production \u2013 Ecuador emitted an estimated six million tonnes of CO2. In 2016, this fell to five million. This has since dropped to between 1.5 and 2 million tonnes. However, the overall balance may not be so positive since the construction of hydropower plants has considerable environmental impacts, which, as figures for many of the projects show, also have big economic costs. They have also led to\u00a0energy overproduction, which is difficult to correct, according to Paulina Garz\u00f3n of the China-Latin America Sustainable Investment Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s politically and economically non-viable for any Ecuadorean government to undertake genuinely clean energy projects such as wind or solar when it already has excess energy production and an onerous debt to repay,\u201d said Garz\u00f3n, who authored a\u00a0book chapter\u00a0on the projects and the loans that made them possible. \u201cThe construction of Coca Codo Sinclair is an immense obstacle to achieving a truly clean energy matrix in Ecuador,\u201d she added. Following its loan default in 2008, Ecuador has been locked out of international capital markets, leading Correa\u2019s government to agree loan packages with China that are repaid with oil sales. As global crude prices slumped, Ecuador had to pump more oil to meet its repayments, calling into question both the economic and environmental sustainability of the model. For Arturo Villavicencio, professor of ecological economics and energy at the Andean University, hydropower development was the best way to shift Ecuador\u2019s energy mix, but the scale of development was too great. \u201cThe reasonable thing would have been to select smaller projects, where the national contribution could have been greater,\u201d said Villavicencio, who was also a\u00a0former member of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u201cA great opportunity for national technological development was wasted and we would not have had the Chinese making all projects turnkey,\u201d added Villavicencio, in reference to\u00a0contracts that give\u00a0decision-making power\u00a0to the financier. Part of the problem, Villavicencio said, is that many companies were not prepared to sort out the technical problems they found and that the Ecuadorean government has been unable to monitor their work. Furthermore, although there are several construction problems in need of monitoring in the remaining dams, Villavicencio warned that Ecuador will fail to reap the benefits of hydropower if the country does not improve supervision of rivers that feed into the system.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Alexandra Valencia, Brian Ellsworth 7 Min Read QUITO (Reuters) - Conflicts with indigenous communities have stalled operations at Ecuador\u2019s San Carlos Panantza copper mining project, which the government of President Lenin Moreno had long pointed to as an example of mining sector expansion that would generate $40 billion in export revenue over the next decade. Many now view the $3 billion project bankrolled by China\u2019s ExplorCobres S.A. as emblematic of the turmoil impeding Ecuador\u2019s push to become an Andean mining power to rival Peru and Chile. The project had been slated to start exporting copper this year, but a dispute with the Shuar indigenous community led ExplorCobres to halt the project nearly two years ago, according to the country\u2019s mining authority, which says the company does not believe conditions on the ground are suitable to resume work. Unknown assailants in March set fire to mine installations and stole equipment. In a series of complaints, indigenous groups say the government did not adequately consult them about projects. The strife is undermining Ecuador\u2019s ambitious plans to develop large-scale mining as an alternative to its oil industry. \u201cThere is not a consensus on what role mining should play in the development of economy, and communities often feel like they\u2019ve been run over,\u201d said Sergio Guzman, Andean region director for consultancy group Colombia Risk Analysis. \u201cA conciliation is needed between the (government\u2019s) mining objectives, and how this results in (benefits) for the communities.\u201d Of the five projects with $7 billion in investment that form the backbone of the mining effort, two - including San Carlos Panantza - have completely halted. A third is relocating some facilities due to local opposition. Other projects that are less advanced face pushback from local leaders still unconvinced their communities will benefit from an industry plagued by worries about environmental damage and limited job creation. On Wednesday, Ecuador\u2019s electoral court approved a referendum to be held in February that will ask voters if they want to outlaw mining near rivers that run through the city of Cuenca. The results would be binding but not retroactive. Mining industry leaders complain that such referendums change the goal posts on projects that were developed under a different set of guidelines from Ecuador\u2019s government. The resistance could undermine Ecuador\u2019s efforts to generate tax revenue to ensure a return to economic growth and bolster state finances after an IMF-backed debt restructuring plan this year. Ecuador lags Chile and Peru in mining development despite having what are believed to be ample deposits of copper and gold. It has not completed enough exploration to determine total mineral reserves, according to the government. The industry will generate about $4 billion in tax revenue and some $40 billion in export earnings over the next decade, according to the government\u2019s most conservative estimates. Mining Deputy Minister Cesar Vasquez told Reuters in a recent interview that Ecuador is prepared to adjust timeframes so concessions do not expire due to social conflicts. Still, he acknowledged that community resistance was dampening investor enthusiasm. \u201cThere are people who are opposed to mining activity and they are going to (oppose it) with or without the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state will always act within the law to defend the interests of the country.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s mining effort can boast some success stories. The Fruta del Norte gold mine led by Canada\u2019s Lundin Gold Inc is already exporting. The same is true of the Mirador copper mine owned by a subsidiary of Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan Investment, the ultimate parent of ExplorCobres. Canada\u2019s Solaris Resources, in charge of the now-exploratory Warintza copper-molybdenum project, created a strategic alliance with two communities of the Shuar people in September after three years of dialogue. But community opposition has taken its toll - particularly at San Carlos Panantza, which has never been on good terms with the local community. \u201cThe government approved concessions years ago without providing information and without the knowledge of the Shuar-Arutam people,\u201d said Josefina Tunki, president of the Shuar-Arutam. \u201cThe people have said \u2018no\u2019 to having this large-scale extractivist company in our territory.\u201d Indigenous activists said the mine\u2019s first camp in 2016 displaced eight families and eliminated the ancestral village of Nankints, triggering a standoff with the Shuar people that year that left one police officer dead and five wounded. Then-president Rafael Correa described them as a \u201cminuscule group of extremists,\u201d denying the area was ancestral territory and ordering a military occupation. ExplorCobres did not reply to a request for comment. In March, it issued a statement condemning the attack on the project, calling them \u201cdelinquent acts by armed groups that came from outside the zones of influence of the project.\u201d Moreno, elected in 2017, hoped to turn the page on the incident. But by 2018, the mining authority had agreed to indefinitely extend the time frame during which ExplorCobres could carry out exploration, citing social conflict. The Shuar people filed a lawsuit to have the entire project scrapped and demanded damage payments from ExplorCobres for the forced displacement of its people, but the case was thrown out by a provincial court in 2019. The Shuar are now taking the fight beyond Ecuador\u2019s borders, saying in November they will file a complaint with the International Labor Organization against Ecuador. The complaint will argue that granting the mine concessions without the group\u2019s permissions violates ILO statutes on the rights of indigenous peoples. Though an ILO decision alone would not alter the course of the mine, a negative recommendation would pressure authorities by staining Ecuador\u2019s reputation in the diplomatic community. The office of Ecuador\u2019s attorney general, which represents the country in international legal disputes, said it had not been informed about the complaint. \u201cWe will never allow extractivist companies into our territory, we want to live in a territory without pollution,\u201d said Tunki at a press conference.

            "text": " For the teenagers of Jesuit High School, every morning starts with a single-question exam \u2014 COVID-19 positive or not? Twice a week that includes testing. The routine at this all-male Catholic institution goes like this: Head back in the parking lot, swab up the nose, roll into the gym for pingpong  and movies while waiting for test results.  For the record: 1:17 p.m. March 9, 2021An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported how Jesuit students are examined daily for COVID-19. While they are checked for symptoms each day before school starts, students undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week. \u201cIt\u2019s a good model for other schools,\u201d said Michael Wood, Jesuit\u2019s principal. \u201cIf you want to open your campus, you have to do this.\u201d As the debate over reopening California classrooms continues, parochial schools such as Jesuit provide a possible road map for how their public counterparts can do it safely, especially for older grades where the challenges are greater. Studies indicate that teenagers can transmit the coronavirus more easily than younger students, and high school pupils are more difficult to keep in isolated groups because they often switch classrooms during the day.  So far at Jesuit, after two months of full-time campus life with about 800 boys and a semester of half-time before that, students, staff and teachers have rarely tested positive. Since the first day of screening in October, \u201cBlack Monday\u201d as Wood calls it for its chaos, about 40 active COVID-19 cases have been found. But that has dropped to zero in more recent weeks under strict rules for both students and families.  Already, said Wood, about 10 other schools or districts have visited to learn from Jesuit\u2019s experience.  The school\u2019s record so far isn\u2019t an anomaly. In Northern California, many parochial schools run by area dioceses or individual religious orders have been back on campus for months, with few hit by quarantines or outbreaks.  In San Francisco, health officials have linked open schools to fewer than five outbreaks, though about 96 parochial and private schools are operating with on-campus classes. Sacramento health officials said most problems with their county\u2019s open schools have been resolved by cooperation between administrators and health officers, though positive tests have forced some classes and even schools to temporarily close. On March 1, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislative leaders announced an agreement to give $2 billion in incentive funding to encourage public school districts to open in coming weeks, though mostly for students up to second grade, and billions more to help with other costs. For counties that fall from the state\u2019s highest rates of virus transmission to the lower tier under state guidelines, access to that money would include opening all elementary and some upper grades.   Although it\u2019s known that safe spaces, access to protective equipment, mitigation measures, testing and vaccines are needed to reopen schools, some groups engaged in the debate caution that public schools cannot easily replicate the strategies of smaller and less complex private institutions.  Public school leaders point out that with no state guidelines, each district is forced to work out its own reopening rules, often sparking disagreements with teachers unions, staff and parents. In January, six public school superintendents from across the state wrote to Newsom requesting state baselines, but so far, decisions are being hashed out at the local level. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not really a question of whether we can logistically adopt the same measures that private schools have put in place,\u201d said Jorge Aguilar, superintendent of the Sacramento City Unified School District, which serves about 40,000 students. \u201cFor us, that lack of common standards makes it a bit more difficult.\u201d California \nSchools in more affluent areas move faster to reopen than those in low-income communities\n Feb. 11, 2021 Equity is also an issue. Rates of transmission and deaths are higher in Black, Latino and economically disadvantaged communities, often the same areas where schools have smaller budgets, fewer resources, larger classes and problems like old buildings with poor ventilation. At the same time, though coronavirus cases among children have been rarer and less severe than for adults, evidence is mounting that children are not only susceptible but also can suffer long-term health consequences. Authorization for a vaccine for use on children is probably months away.  Claudia Briggs, spokeswoman for the California Teachers Assn., said forcing quick openings with incentive funding may \u201cpenalize\u201d communities where rates of transmission are still high, or where plans have already been put in place for later returns. While the new state funding will help put safety measures in place, she points out that private schools may already be benefiting from wealthier families and neighborhoods where the virus hasn\u2019t hit as hard.  A recent national survey by the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research found parents are starkly divided by race when it comes to reopening schools. While half of white parents preferred their children to receive in-person education, that dropped to 30% for Black parents and 23% for Hispanic parents.  Still, Lincoln Snyder, the superintendent of  schools for the Catholic Diocese of Sacramento, said he believes reopening is difficult but doable. He\u2019s in his ninth version of a protocol packet that spans 85 pages but has been approved by health officers in the multiple counties where his schools are located. Sticking to that plan is the key, he said. Through a combination of testing and mitigation measures, more than 13,000 kids across 44 schools under his control have found themselves sitting at desks, playing  tetherball at recess and \u201cseeing my friends and doing fun activities,\u201d as Kieran Ryan, a kindergartner at Mt. St. Mary\u2019s in Grass Valley, describes it.  Set in the foothills north of Sacramento, Mt. St. Mary\u2019s has been open since August. Buoyed by its success at managing the virus, the school added kids after winter break, many from families frustrated with online school.  On a recent morning, 194 children from transitional kindergarten through eighth grade filled the three-story brick building, once a home of nuns beginning in the 1800s. The playground has been divided so that kids can use it in small groups. A hand sanitizer station greeted students in the drop-off line. Intercom messages have replaced a morning assembly.  But other than kids in masks and one in a face shield, the Pledge of Allegiance in Megan Hood\u2019s kindergarten room looks the same as it has for years. On her kids\u2019 desks are plastic dinosaurs and green play dough to build a habitat for them. When a boy in the front row decides to visit the girl sitting behind him, Hood gives him a gentle reproof.  \u201cMiles, have a seat, little man,\u201d Hood says, and he quickly does.  It is that type of direct contact that Hood says makes her feel \u201cblessed\u201d to be teaching in person.  \u201cHow do you teach interacting with your peers on a Zoom call?\u201d she asked.   Though Hood\u2019s school also tests regularly, it has scaled back to once a month for teachers as case numbers in the community have fallen and no outbreaks have occurred within its walls.  Though tests have found some positive cases, so far they\u2019ve been traced to sources outside the classroom, such as three kids infected at a slumber party. As parents have realized the potential consequences of their outside actions, Principal Edee Wood (no relation to Jesuit\u2019s Michael Wood) said she has seen behavior change. No one testing positive wants to be forced to admit taking a secret vacation and being \u201cthe reason the school closed,\u201d she said.  Jesuit\u2019s Wood said that he\u2019s seen a similar change in families\u2019 behavior as they have realized that testing and tracing work.  At his school, within 25 minutes of the students getting their noses swiped, the dozen-strong staff of teachers and technicians from an urgent care center, working in a science lab down the hall, will process the rapid tests of and notify the lounging teens of results on their cellphones. In all, the morning regime takes about two hours. The all-clear means a semi-normal day of in-person instruction, though one in which masks and social distancing are still required.  If a test comes back positive for the coronavirus, it means quarantine, contact tracing and possibly weeks of online classes.  The extra work and the extra staff needed are among the biggest challenges of this testing program, Jesuit\u2019s principal said. The first weeks came with tough lessons \u2014 including a slew of false positives caused by tests that grew too warm when placed under a window. But now, he said, the regime is so smooth that the school has become a vaccination site for the wider community, using its system to get the shots to thousands of people each weekend.  \u201cThere were moments of incredible pride and incredible doubt,\u201d Michael Wood said. \u201cNow it\u2019s all pride and being grateful that we didn\u2019t let the initial doubt stop us.\u201d California \nReopening high schools gets ugly, divisive in Bay Area district where rich and poor mix\n Feb. 27, 2021 Reopening also requires money, Snyder said. His elementary schools have tuition that averages  about $6,000 annually and can drop as low as $3,000 per student in disadvantaged communities, where philanthropy helps cover costs. Jesuit, which Snyder does not oversee, charges about $16,000 annually.  When Snyder first began a districtwide testing program in the fall, the tests initially cost $25 per student \u2014 amounting to about $50,000 every time all students were tested. He was able to partly cover that bill with Paycheck Protection Program funds, but his diocese spent about $6,000 per student annually before the pandemic, leaving many facilities operating under a loss this year.   But recently, Snyder said a change in California regulation will allow him to purchase the tests directly from the manufacturer for $5 each and train school staffers on their use, a \u201cgame changer\u201d for schools that invest in testing, he said.  Recent availability of vaccines is also helping. Snyder said it has been a morale booster by allowing teachers and staff \u201cthe freedom to be able to reunite with family and loved ones.\u201d But not all teachers have opted to take the vaccine. About half the staff at Mt. St. Mary\u2019s have so far been inoculated, but math and language arts teacher Dave Pistone said he\u2019s waiting a bit, in part because he believes his risk of exposure is offset by the school\u2019s safety measures.  As his middle school students readied for a debate on the death penalty, Pistone stood near a bottle of 3% chlorine spray resting on a shelf filled with copies of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d He said when the school opened in the fall, \u201cI swore that first week if we could make it to Friday I would thank God.\u201d Now, he thinks that the protocols are working \u201csplendidly\u201d and that kids and teachers are motivated to stick to the rules because they much prefer the in-person experience. Taylor Brewer, a seventh-grader who came to Mt. St. Mary\u2019s after winter break, said that he was stressed out at his previous school because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t comprehend things as well\u201d over Zoom.  Sitting in the front row of Pistone\u2019s math room, filled with about 20 other kids, Taylor said being on campus offers \u201ca sense of stability we like.\u201d Wood, the Jesuit principal, said the importance of healing from the pandemic \u2014 not just keeping safe from it \u2014 is one of the most crucial lessons he\u2019s learned. The second semester, though partially back on campus, \u201clacked the joy and the fun and that\u2019s what kids need to be having,\u201d he said.  Wood said he realized that asking teenage boys for five straight days of strict rules was too much, especially after months of isolation. So Wednesdays are free from instruction, he said.  Last week, that meant a  cornhole tournament on a lawn, and a food truck serving fat burgers dripping with cheese. The White Stripes and Outkast played on a tinny sound system, while about 100 boys tossed beanbags and hung out in the winter sunshine.  \u201cJust knowing you are safe and able to be with your friends and brothers, you are at peace,\u201d said senior Carlo Pedroncelli, a lacrosse player headed to the University of Nevada, Reno. \u201cAt the end of last year, I didn\u2019t think any of this would be possible.

Th project will be handled on behalf of the Jamaican government by the Housing Agency of Jamaica (HAJ) and is being fully financed by CHEC. The deal was inked by Prime Minister Andrew Holness;\u00a0President of CHEC Americas Division, DR Zhimin Hu; and HAJ Board Chairman Norman Brown at the Office of the Prime Minister in St Andrew. Holness said Catherine Estates will provide an affordable and safe housing option for Jamaicans from the lower income bracket. \u201cThe project will be done in six phases in 14 clusters and will have sidewalks, corner shops, potable water supply, road networks, storm water drainage, nine open spaces, buffer zones and two large neighbourhood parks,\u201d Holness said. He said there would be nine acres of land reserved for the construction of a primary and secondary school in addition to a church, a police station and a health centre.

(Theresa Edwards/ First published in Bolivian Express) Indigenous protesters at Chepete/ El Bala dam site, November 2016. (Theresa Edwards/ First published in Bolivian Express) Last November, representatives of 17 indigenous communities held a vigil at the site of two megadams\u2014El Chepete and El Bala\u2014that President Evo Morales plans to build in Bolivia\u2019s Amazonian region. The protesters blocked access to the site by Geodata, the Italian firm hired by the government to study the dams\u2019 feasibility. Twelve days later, Geodata\u2019s engineers withdrew their equipment, announcing, \u201cIf there\u2019s no [community] consensus, the conditions don\u2019t exist for us to work.\u201d The episode represents a small but important victory for indigenous groups, environmental activists, and civil society organizations that have resisted construction of the dams for several years. \u00a0It also poses at least a symbolic challenge to Morales\u2019s stated goal of converting Bolivia into South America\u2019s leading energy powerhouse, primarily through the production and export of hydroelectricity\u2014with potentially devastating social, environmental, and economic consequences for Bolivia. The two dams, proposed to be completed over next 10-15 years, will be located north of the capital city of La Paz on the Beni River, which divides the La Paz and Beni departments. With the combined capacity to generate 3700 mw (megawatts) of electricity, Chepete/ El Bala will be Bolivia\u2019s largest hydropower source, and one of most significant megadam projects in the region. Since Bolivia already has the capacity to produce the electricity it needs for domestic use, the energy generated by the new dams will be used almost exclusively for export, primarily to neighboring Brazil and Argentina. In fact, Chepete/ El Bala is the centerpiece of the Morales government\u2019s ambitious $27 billion program to develop 35 hydroelectric plants (including 23 megadams) throughout the country by 2025, that will generate 11,000 mw of electricity, including at least 8,000 for export. According to Vice President Alvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, this strategy is the key to diversifying Bolivia\u2019s economy, which historically has been heavily reliant on natural gas exports. With its gas reserves dwindling and hydrocarbons prices plummeting, Garc\u00eda Linera argues, Bolivia must shift its energy matrix not only to generate cleaner energy sources but to develop alternative export products to secure its economic future. Underscoring this new focus, the Morales government has created a new cabinet-level Energy Ministry to oversee the generation and export of electricity, as well as the development of lithium and, potentially, nuclear energy. The Morales government revivied the long-dormant plan for Chepete/El Bala in 2007, with a Supreme Decree declaring the project a national priority. Geodata completed a preliminary feasibility study in 2015. In July 2016, a second contract for more detailed design feasibility was awarded to same firm, to be completed in 15 months, leading to the exploratory testing that has now been suspended. While no formal environmental impact study has yet been commissioned, critics say the project will have devastating social and environmental consequences. Pablo Sol\u00f3n, former UN Ambassador and climate change negotiator for the Morales government, and a leading opponent of the project, says the dams will inundate an area larger than the city of La Paz, creating the second biggest lake in Bolivia after Lake Titicaca (now that Lake Poop\u00f3 has dried up). Some 4,000 inhabitants of indigenous Amazonian communities (including Tsimanes, Tacanas, Mosetenes, and Uchupiamonas), who have relied on the river and forest for subsistence for generations, will be directly or indirectly displaced. The affected zone includes portions of the Pil\u00f3n Largas and Madidi National Parks, home to thousands of rare plant and animal species and one of the world\u2019s most biodiverse regions. Critics say deforestation caused by the dams will release enormous quantities of greenhouse and toxic methane gas, accelerating environmental disequilibriums and the negative impacts of climate change, not only in Bolivia, but throughout the region. The environmental damage will also stifle tourism in the two parks, which receive some 30,000 visitors (domestic and foreign) annually. Much of this ecotourist industry is run by indigenous communities, generating up to $15 million in yearly revenues for community economic development initiatives. What\u2019s more, according to Sol\u00f3n and Pablo Villegas, a principal economic investigator with CEDIB (the Bolivian Center for Information and Documentation), it\u2019s not at all clear that the Chepete/ El Bala project is economically beneficial or feasible. The Morales government\u2019s projected costs for the dams ($6.3 billion), they note, do not include the necessary transmission pipelines to Brazil, which will add another $3 billion according to CEDIB's calculations. Even without these additional costs, the project represents the largest single energy-related investment in Bolivian history, amounting to 1.5 times the current external debt, with financing sources still undetermined. While the government argues that the sale of electricity from Chepete/ El Bala will generate $1.25 billion annually, allowing it to recover its investment in five to seven years, Sol\u00f3n and Villegas say these claims are purely speculative. No contracts have yet been signed with Brazil or Argentina. Leaked data from the preliminary feasibility studies--which have not been fully disclosed to the public--suggest that the projected price of electricity needed to amortize the high cost of the dams will far exceed the price currently paid by Brazil for domesticaly generated electricity in the regions closest to Bolivia. Not only Brazil, but also Chile, Paraguay, and Peru already have or are developing extensive renewable energy systems based on hydro, thermal, and solar power, that can satisfy domestic needs more cheaply than imported energy. In effect, Sol\u00f3n argues, the Chepete/ El Bala megadams reflect an obsolete, 20th century energy development and export model that is no longer economically viable in the region. Most recently, the Morales government has sought to promote Chepete/ \u00a0El Bala as a solution to the water emergency in La Paz, where rationing has been in place since November. \u201cWe must build more dams to prevent water shortages,\u201d Morales asserted in December. Chepete/ El Bala is not designed to collect water for domestic consumption, but only to create energy for export.\u00a0Environmentalist Silvia Molina, among others, has been quick to point out that Chepete/ El Bala is not designed to collect water for domestic consumption, but only to create energy for export.\u00a0Moreover, further disruption of Bolivia\u2019s rain cycles due to dam-related deforestation will only exacerbate the water crisis in a country that is now experiencing its worst drought in 30 years. A major concern of groups opposed to the dams has been the government\u2019s failure to seek the prior, informed consent of affected indigenous communities, in good faith, as required by the Bolivian Constitution and international conventions to which Bolivia subscribes. Initially, ENDE, the state energy company, took the position that a consulta was required only for proposed hydrocarbons projects. Last year, Bolivia's national energy company, ENDE, has promised to carry out a formal consulta in the affected zone, but only after the design of the dams has been elaborated and the environmental impact study completed. At the same time, Garc\u00eda Linera has vowed that the government will ignore opponents of the project, whom he dismisses as externally-funded agents \u201cpaid to impede Bolivia\u2019s development and foment water shortages.\u201d If local opposition to the dams persists, Morales says he will seek a department-wide referendum in La Paz, which he is confident will support the project. La Paz Governor F\u00e9lix Patzi\u2014a somewhat unpredicatable indigenous former Minister of Education in the first Morales government, who was elected on a rival center-left party ticket\u2014has endorsed the project, hoping to capture a significant share of hydropower profits for his department\u2019s use. As a further incentive to Patzi, Garc\u00eda Linera has openly warned that La Paz\u2019s economic and political leadership will be \u201cat risk\u201d if Chepete/ El Bala does not proceed. For their part, indigenous groups in the affected zone, represented by the Amazon Defense Coordinating Committee (the \u201cCoordinadora\u201d), reject the newly-promised consulta as \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d They are planning a popular initiative to challenge the project legally before Bolivia\u2019s Constitutional Court. How strategic is this project when the world is going in another direction?At the same time, the Coordinadora has proposed a national referendum on the Chepete/ El Bala megadams. \u201cThe problem of the dams is not only ours, but a problem for all Bolivians because these national resources belong to all of us,\u201d says leader Valentin Luna. \u201cAnd who will pay this multi-million dollar debt?\u00a0How strategic is this project when the world is going in another direction?\u201d For many, the current struggle over Chepete/ El Bala evokes bitter memories of the\u00a0 2011-12 TIPNIS conflict, when indigenous, environmental, and other popular sectors broke with Morales over his plan to build a highway through protected indigenous lands elsewhere in the Amazon. It was a watershed moment in Bolivia\u2019s contemporary political history, bringing into public focus for the first time the costs of Morales\u2019s extractivist development model, and marking a realignment of popular forces into pro- and anti- government factions which persists to this day.

(Photo by Theresa Edwards) While the government appears to have learned few lessons from the TIPNIS controversy, activists like Pablo Sol\u00f3n are encouraged by the new and growing resistance to megadams. In contrast to the TIPNIS case, he notes, Chepete/ El Bala has provoked widespread debate about alternative economic models\u2014in this case, for alternative energy\u2014in academic, political, and social movement circles. \u201cEl Bala will be the funeral of the megaprojects\u201d that have preoccupied the Morales government, he predicts. Bolivia is already investing in decentralized and truly environmentally-friendly energy solutions, such as a new $100 million, 50 mw\u00a0solar plant in Oruro that will cover half of the department\u2019s energy needs. Sol\u00f3n envisions a massive government-funded solar program (along with small-scale wind, thermal, and micro-hydropower initiatives) that could make Bolivia not a regional energy powerhouse, but a regional model for decentralized, locally-based, and government-supported alternative energy. Similar networks of government-assisted, community-based agroecology, agroforestry, and ecotourism projects also exist and are ripe for expansion. \u00a0 Groups in the forefront of the current resistance to megadams, such as the Coordinadora, appear to have a broad structural perspective that goes well beyond local concerns. A recent youth mobilization in defense of earth and water, organized simultaneously in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz, focused on the relationship between extractivism, water shortages, and the proposed megadams, and emphasized the need for alternative development strategies. In the words of the ever-optimistic Sol\u00f3n, \u201cAnother Bolivia is possible.\u201d Watch the documentary by Theresa Edwards on the indigenous resistance to Chepete/El Bala below:  Emily Achtenberg is an urban planner, a member of NACLA's Editorial Board, and the author of NACLA\u2019s\u00a0Rebel Currents\u00a0blog\u00a0covering Latin American social movements and progressive governments. \u00a0  Like this article?

            "text": " Earlier this month we learned that some of President Joe Biden\u2019s attempts at backroom diplomacy with Iran were rebuffed, with the Iranians essentially telling the White House that we would need to \u201cgo first.\u201d What they wanted was the lifting of at least some of the sanctions on them before they would consider any direct negotiations with the United States over their nuclear program. This weekend saw some news bubbling up in Arabic outlets suggesting that the Biden administration may have taken that request to heart. Our colleague Nick Arama at RedState dug up some chatter from Iranian sources suggesting that Biden had unfrozen some of the billions of dollars of Iranian assets currently locked up in the Trade Bank of Iraq and that some \u201ctransactions\u201d had already taken place. If so, this would be a major shift in policy without any notification to the public. An Iranian trade official said Friday the US green-lit the release of Iranian funds that have been frozen in Iraq due to US sanctions. Citing Iraqi sources, Hamid Hosseini, board member of the Iran-Iraq Joint Chamber of Commerce, said Washington has approved the release of frozen Iranian assets at the Trade Bank of Iraq. \u201cSeveral transactions have [already] been made,\u201d Hosseini wrote on Twitter, without mentioning the value of the assets. Before we get too excited, we should note that these reports are coming from Iran International and Al Arabiya, not exactly the most reliable of sources. It\u2019s still entirely possible that this is just some gossip being spread around by the Iranians to influence public opinion. An Iranian trade official says the #US has approved the release of frozen Iranian assets at the Trade Bank of #Iraq, after sanctions imposed by Washington prevented #Iran from accessing tens of billions of its assets in foreign banks. Read more:https://t.co/VLDNXxvZ24 \u2014 Al Arabiya English (@AlArabiya_Eng) March 7, 2021  While it seems unlikely, I wouldn\u2019t write this off entirely. Afer all, some of our allies have already made similar moves. Last month, South Korea unfroze some of Iran\u2019s assets, reportedly as a goodwill gesture toward North Korea. But would Joe Biden really agree to do this on the down-low (as the kids like to say) without informing the press corps? After all, the smoke still hasn\u2019t entirely cleared from the last missile attack that Iranian insurgents launched at our airbase in Iraq from Syria. Attacks by those militias were the primary reason Biden cited for launching the first military action of his presidency last month, annoying congressional leaders who were not informed of the decision in advance. There\u2019s been no confirmation from the White House that this unfreezing of Iran\u2019s assets has taken place. But then again, I haven\u2019t heard them denying it yet either. If this is happening and it\u2019s an attempt at some sort of carrot and stick diplomacy, we\u2019re sending some extremely mixed messages to our allies. We would essentially be lobbing missiles at Iran with one hand and tossing bundles of cash to them with the other. We need to either be holding Iran accountable and demanding they open up their nuclear facilities fully for IAEA inspectors or basically just admit that they\u2019ve outfoxed us and let them start (or continue) enriching weapons-grade fuel.  \nCopyright \u00a92021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

            "text": " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With President Joe Biden on the verge of his first big legislative victory, a key moderate Democrat says he\u2019s open to changing Senate rules that could allow for more party-line votes to push through other parts of the White House\u2019s agenda such as voting rights. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin stressed Sunday that he wants to keep the procedural hurdle known as the filibuster, saying major legislation should always have significant input from the minority party. But he noted there are other ways to change the rules that now effectively require 60 votes for most legislation. One example: the \u201ctalking filibuster,\u201d which requires senators to slow a bill by holding the floor, but then grants an \u201cup or down\u201d simple majority vote if they give up. Advertisement \u201cThe filibuster should be painful, it really should be painful and we\u2019ve made it more comfortable over the years,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cMaybe it has to be more painful.\u201d \u201cIf you want to make it a little bit more painful, make him stand there and talk,\u201d Manchin added. \u201cI\u2019m willing to look at any way we can, but I\u2019m not willing to take away the involvement of the minority.\u201d Democrats are beginning to look to their next legislative priorities after an early signature win for Biden on Saturday, with the\u00a0Senate approving\u00a0a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan on a party-line 50-49 vote. Final passage is expected Tuesday in the House if leaders can hold the support of progressives frustrated that the Senate narrowed unemployment benefits and stripped out an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Over the weekend, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, representing around 100 House liberals, called the Senate\u2019s weakening of some provisions \u201cbad policy and bad politics.\u201d But Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also characterized the changes as \u201crelatively minor concessions\u201d and emphasized the bill retained its \u201ccore bold, progressive elements.\u201d Biden says he would sign the measure immediately if the House passed it. The legislation would allow many Americans to receive $1,400 in direct checks from the government this month. \u201cLessons learned: If we have unity, we can do big things,\u201d a jubilant Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,\u00a0told The Associated Press\u00a0in an interview after Saturday\u2019s vote. Still, the Democrats\u2019 approach required a last-minute call from Biden to Manchin to secure his vote after he raised late resistance to the breadth of unemployment benefits. That immediately raised questions about the path ahead in a partisan environment where few, if any, Republicans are expected to back planks of the president\u2019s agenda. Democrats used a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation to approve Biden\u2019s top priority without Republican support, a strategy that succeeded despite the reservations of some moderates. But work in the coming months on other issues such as voting rights and immigration could prove more difficult. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pledged that Senate Republicans would block passage of a sweeping House-passed bill on voting rights. The measure, known as HR 1, would restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to the campaign finance system. It would serve as a counterweight to voting rights restrictions advancing in Republican-controlled statehouses across the country in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s repeated false claims about a \u201cstolen\u201d election. \u201cNot one Republican is going to vote for HR 1 because it\u2019s a federal takeover of elections, it sets up a system where there is no real voter security or verification,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt is a liberal wish list in terms of how you vote.\u201d The Senate is divided 50-50, but Democrats control the chamber because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast the tie-breaking vote. With 60 votes effectively needed on most legislation, Democrats must win the support of at least some Republicans to pass Biden\u2019s agenda. When asked about the voting rights bill, Manchin on Sunday left the door open to supporting some kind of a workaround to allow for passage based on a simple majority, suggesting he could support \u201creconciliation\u201d if he was satisfied that Republicans had the ability to provide input. But it was unclear how that would work as voting rights are not budget-related and would not qualify for the reconciliation process. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go there until my Republican friends have the ability to have their say also,\u201d Manchin said. On Sunday, the anti-filibuster advocacy group \u201cFix Our Senate\u201d praised Manchin\u2019s comments as a viable way to get past \u201cpure partisan obstruction\u201d in the Senate. \u201cSen. Manchin just saw Senate Republicans unanimously oppose a wildly popular and desperately-needed COVID relief bill that only passed because it couldn\u2019t be filibustered, so it\u2019s encouraging to hear him express openness to reforms to ensure that voting rights and other critical bills can\u2019t be blocked by a purely obstructionist minority,\u201d the group said in a statement. Manchin spoke on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d and Graham appeared on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Alan Fram and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report."

Concrete Earthworks installed capacity tunnels Hydroelectric power plant El Tambolar Energ\u00eda Provincial Sociedad del Estado (E.P.S.E.)\u00a0, Provincia de San Juan The El Tambolar Hydropower plant, is to be built on the San Juan River near the town of Pachaco, 145 km from the city of San Juan and 20 km upstream of the Los Caracoles dam. The works involve an access road from the Los Caracoles power plant, the diversion channels for the San Juan River, a gravel concrete-faced dam with flood spillway and an open-air channel. \u00a0Generation is pressure-driven and there is an external power plant. The diversion of the river for the construction of the dam was undertaken by building two parallel tunnels lined with a reinforced concrete trunk section on the right bank of the river. Both tunnels are 6 meters in diameter and have a length of 492 meters. One of the two tunnels will later function as a bottom outlet, so a sluice gate will be built inside it with an access tunnel leading to it. The dam will have a height of 88 m above the river and 113 m from its foundation on the rock. The crown is 450 m long with a filling of a volume of 5,100,000 cubic meters of alluvial materials. The concrete face will be 76,000 m2, while the spillway located on the right bank will be free with a weir of 250 m in length able to take as much as 3,200 m\u00b3/s. Tunnels take the water to the powerhouse through the rock mass with a circular section of 5.70 meters in diameter and 2,600 meters in length, with a surge chamber and pressure steel pipe in the final stretch before reaching the powerhouse. < VOLVER A OBRAS HIDROEL\u00c9CTRICAS OBRA SIGUIENTE >"

            "text": " Home / Local News / Dr Clyde Cave steady under strain By Geralyn Edward He is the doctor who manages to elicit smiles from babies and children, even in the sometimes tension-filled environment of a hospital or his medical office. He is known for taking calls from frantic newbie parents at 2 in the morning, as calmly as he would at 2 in the afternoon.\u00a0 Today, though, Dr Clyde Cave carries a different burden of responsibility that has thrust him into the spotlight during this COVID-19 pandemic, as Director of Medical Services at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH). As has been the case over his four decades as a medical practitioner, Dr Cave is solidly calm. He answers the questions shot his way at COVID-19 Press conferences in a straightforward manner, accepting that the facts remain the facts, even when others may disagree. The signature on Cave\u2019s emails offers a snapshot of his many roles. They are long and impressive. He is the hospital\u2019s Senior Consultant Paediatrician and Neonatologist, Programme Director of the Shaw Centre for Paediatric Excellence at the QEH, a senior Associate Lecturer in Child Health at the Cave Hill Campus of the University of the West Indies, and a consultant to the Eastern Caribbean Neonatal Network.\u00a0 Hospital administration\u00a0 He also operates a limited private practice and still finds time for philanthropic pursuits. While navigating the responsibilities that have come with his transition from hands-on medical care, to hospital administration, and the mentoring of young doctors, Cave told COVID Weekly, his desire is also to influence the direction of the QEH; to be part of the solutions, and not simply complain about the problems. He is proud of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), in which he played a key role in establishing. He also admits that a non-negotiable part of his contract for his senior administrative role a year ago was an insistence that he be allowed to have at least a limited private practice. He loves the fact that he is now attending to children, whose parents he cared for when they too were toddlers. He admits delight in the role he plays helping children to grow healthy and happy. Cave said of his elevation at the QEH: \u201cIt came out of the realisation that in order to do the doctoring, you must have the support of all the other things that enable us to do the doctoring. If we don\u2019t have the supplies, or the finances, or the appropriate nurses, or the long-term plan for integration into where the hospital is going as an organisation, then our ability to look after an individual is impacted.\u201d Lightheartedly blaming his late mother for his decision to seek a senior management role at the hospital, he quipped: \u201cAll I could hear was her voice saying, \u2018If you are not part of the solution then you are part of the problem\u2019.\u201d The hospital administrator\u2019s drive to improve the institution\u2019s efficiency has been stalled somewhat by the pandemic. He admits the deadly disease is consuming the human and other resources at an alarming rate. \u201cWhile part of the COVID-19 response is my primary responsibility . . . I am reminding people that even though COVID-19 is on our minds, we still have a lot of sick people in this country. Arguably, even more so, since COVID has interrupted our regular practice of health care. And my responsibilities are to make sure that they are not neglected and sidelined while rising to this additional challenge.\u201d MIS-C case\u00a0 Those multiple roles of hospital administrator, consultant pediatrician, and educator, intersected last month in a most dramatic and public way, when a nine-year-old child died of COVID-19. The tragic death of the pediatric patient from COVID-19 was the first of its kind this side of the Caribbean. It became a point of discussion among regional health specialists because of its uniqueness, and the implications it had for management of the disease in the region. The little girl\u2019s passing profoundly impacted him and his colleagues, he admitted to COVID Weekly.\u00a0 He was also equally disturbed by suggestions that this child did not receive the best care.\u00a0 And when information about her death was published in Trinidad and Tobago media before it was shared in Barbados, Cave faced a backlash, with suggestions that confidential information might have been shared in another country about the young patient. \u201cThere was no leak of confidential information. What there was, was a discussion among doctors within the region of a case. There was no identification of the child. But that generic information was disclosed in another country before it was disclosed here. \u201cTo speak in general, public health information terms . . .\u00a0 very personal individual and confidential information is always a challenge.\u201d Furthermore, the senior medical practitioner felt much of the discussion was \u201ca diversion\u201d from what should have been the focus of attention.\u00a0 \u201cThat concern is this disease that so many people have been viewing as only affecting the old and those with comorbidities . . . reached and affected a child.\u201d According to Cave: \u201cChildren are always among our most protected and vulnerable members of our society and to see COVID-19 harm one, was a moment of national awakening.\u201d The child\u2019s passing also impacted the medical team because they worked tirelessly to save her life. \u201cThere is the assumption you could do something to prevent it. There is always the assumption that if a child dies, the care was not as good as it should have been. Both of those things are simplistic and downright wrong. The pediatric complications of COVID-19, Multi-symptom Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C), as we understand it now, is something that is unpredictable. We cannot tell which child infected with COVID-19 will develop this. \u201cWe do know that some children will. And there is a spectrum of severity ranging from those who die to those who are critically ill and require intensive care. \u201cI am certainly confident that in the case of our country, a very high level of intensive medical care was provided in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit by both doctors and nurses. And I certainly dispute that an unfortunate outcome, was an indication there was sub-optimal care. \u201cThe care that children receive in Barbados, just because of our having both a new-born and a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, is something that couldn\u2019t possibly happen in many of our neighbouring countries, much less in some other parts of the world, because they don\u2019t have the privilege of having those facilities.\u201d Emotional toll Of the emotional toll the child\u2019s death took on the medical team, Dr Cave remarked: \u201cThose of us who have the responsibility for providing care always second-guess ourselves. Should we, could we, might we, what happens if it happens again, and is any part of it our fault? \u201cOftentimes in medicine, even when intellectually you answer all those questions, and you know there is nothing different that we could have done . . .\u00a0 you are still left with that emotional charge where your mind knows one thing, but your heart may feel differently.\u00a0 \u201cYes, dealing with the death, being on the receiving end of the calls when everybody was so shocked at how fast there was a turn and the eventual outcome. Yes, it does take a toll.\u201d \u00a0 Stresses of the pandemic\u00a0 Addressing the general concerns of staff at the hospital and the stresses attendant with the pandemic, the Director of Medical Services shared that at times, it can be emotional and overwhelming. The long hours on the job, the fears of medical teams that they could become infected and spread the disease to family members, have added to the stress of the situation. But with the pandemic, he said, has also emerged a determination by hospital staff to remain steadfast to their jobs and commitment to high-quality patient care. Cave, who has been a mentor to scores of young doctors at the QEH, noted: \u201cI am convinced that a lot of the very hard work that is being done, extra work being performed, and the risk to personal safety and family security, is done because the doctors and nurses believe our profession is a higher calling. Yes, you will obviously get people who are in it for other reasons. \u201c. . . We have not been faced with massive sickouts because . . . people have generally tried to pull together to address the situations, in the best way we can as doctors.\u201d With 21 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among QEH employees this year, Cave said all precautions are being taken to ensure that those numbers do not rise. But he said, if it does, it will be a reflection of increases generally on the island.\u00a0 \u201cThe only real tools we have in prevention, is the vaccine, social distancing, protecting with face masks and facial shields, and good hand hygiene,\u201d he said. Cave noted that if everyone does not employ these precautions and the viral illness continues to spread, then more infections in the hospital will follow.\u00a0 Asked whether the QEH had reached the point of being overwhelmed, the senior administrator put it this way: \u201cWe are not overwhelmed yet. When you look at the news from other places, you are very aware of how quickly this situation can change from people who think they are doing okay, to suddenly, every resource is in use.\u00a0 \u201cThere are parts of the system that seemed to be at bursting point. There have certainly been times when our Accident and Emergency Department has had more patients than we would want to be comfortably coping with. But then they move on to other parts of the system, whether that is into the Isolation Facility, if their disease is COVID-19-related, or into the hospital if it is not and their illness requires hospitalisation. \u201cAt the moment, we are relatively lucky in that the large number of people being identified with COVID-19 are at the milder end of the illness spectrum. However, there are the special cases where due to comorbidities or bad luck, are on the more severe end of it.\u201d Cave\u2019s message to Barbadians is simple. \u201cWe have to do what is needed to get through this, in the best way we can.\u201d He is not keen to look back and \u201cfight phantom enemies\u201d. He observed: \u201cWe are an intelligent and caring country, and we have put a lot of our resources toward the tools we need to fight this.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a vaccine, and we should use it to the maximum. We have a system of identification, isolation, and containment of infected persons, and we should do our best to support that, rather than trying to find ways around it.\u00a0 \u201cWe have plans, guidelines and protocols, curfews and population density measures, that have been shown to work and we should try, in the spirit of these, to make them work as best they can and not find ways to beat the system and make exceptions.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a disease that can\u2019t be fought by a single person or doctor, this requires a community effort because the health of individuals also impacts on the health of us all.\u201d This article appears in the March 1 edition of COVID Weekly.

            "text": " A 2.67-mile (4.3 kilometers) breakwater, the longest in Latin America, has been finished in the New Port of Veracruz, hence a new terminal facility is almost ready to begin operations adding capacity to the 116-year old harbor. Such expansion is part of a US$ 3.69 billion (MXN$ 70 billion) project to be executed in two phases, with the first one set to begin operations at the end of June. Once the whole development is completed, cargo capacity in Veracruz will more than triple from 28 million to 95 million tons per year. According to the local authority, Administracion Portuaria Integral de Veracruz (API Veracruz), the breakwater alone required a US$ 158 million investment to build the wall made out of eight million tons of basalt rock and 27,000 pieces of concrete (known as core-locs) of 20, 12, 9 and 3 tons, which will protect the large vessels arriving in Veracruz.  With a width of six meters, this breakwater will resist 26.1-feet (8 meters) high waves and winds of more than 124 miles per hour (200 kph). This engineering work carried out by the Spanish company Copasa is larger than those of ports such as San Antonio in Chile (3.9 kilometers), Panama (3.3 kilometers) and Sao Joao de Barra in Brazil (2 kilometers). The project initiated in 2014 will increase the transit of ships from 2,200 to 3,200 per year, with the potential to receive vessels up to 400 meters long and 58 meters wide. In the first phase of the construction almost half of the budget was invested, but the government through the port authority only contributed US$ 368.4 million (MXN$ 7,000 million) while the rest came from the private sector.  The new port will have five terminal buildings and 35 berths. Terminal operator Hutchison Ports will be the first tenant to handle traffic. Its US$ 450 million facility is expected to receive the new port\u2019s first ship on June 30 Another two operators, IEnova and Pinfra, have already started building their facilities. The first one will handle liquid fuels while the latter will focus on mixed cargo. Grupo Gramosa and Grupo Logra will begin construction work in May, the first to handle agricultural goods and the latter will manage bulk minerals.\u00a0 Environmental measures The New Port of Veracruz is built next to the Veracruz Reef National Park, a major protected natural area formed by coral reefs. For the construction of the new infrastructure, the Port Administration was obliged to rescue and relocate said reefs. Such task was undertaken two years ago by about 153 fishermen, who were trained in diving and rescue of coral colonies. In total, 48,000 marine organisms were relocated 25 kilometers from their original site. Two years after their transfer, a survival rate of 85% was achieved, while environmental authorities demanded 70%. For this task, the fishermen made about 3,000 trips, certified by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the National Polytechnic Institute and the Universidad Veracruzana. These activities are already a global example of reef rescue.

            "text": "   From March 18-22, with the help of the U.S. State Department, I had the opportunity to travel to Trinidad and Tobago to speak with businessmen, academics and others regarding Chinese activities in Trinidad and Tobago.\u00a0 My visit coincided with an important meeting on Venezuela between President Trump and Caribbean leaders working to bring a peaceful end to the repressive Maduro regime. Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Prime Minister Keith Rowley, who strongly objects to international efforts to ensure a democratic outcome in Venezuela\u2019s spiraling crisis, was notably not on the guest list.\u00a0 The increasingly negative tone of the once-close relationship between the U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago coincides with an expansion of the Caribbean country\u2019s economic, political, and security relationship with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), including numerous ongoing Chinese works projects. These include a $500 million Chinese-built drydock and $102 million industrial park in La Brea, significant Chinese positions in the telecommunications sector, gifts of hundreds of police motorcycles, purchases of Chinese buses, and rumors of the PRC acquiring the defunct Petrotrin refinery in Trinidad and Tobago. While the nation is still a functioning democracy, the Rowley regime\u2019s embrace of easy Chinese money, as well as the increasingly dangerous and unpredictable regime in neighboring Venezuela, raises concerns about oil-rich Trinidad and Tobago, strategically located at the entrance of the lesser Antilles. If unchecked, China\u2019s expanding engagement in the country risks leaving a series of economic white elephants and leaving the country under a heavy debt burden. But there are steps the U.S. can take to help. The PRC-Trinidad and Tobago relationship For more than half a century, Trinidad and Tobago has been a center of Chinese attention in the Caribbean. In June 1974, it became one of the first nations of the region to diplomatically recognize the PRC. It was also one of the first to embrace multiple Chinese construction projects, including the Brian Lara cricket stadium (built by Shanghai Construction Group, initially for the 2007 cricket world cup, but not fully completed until a decade later, in May 2017), the refurbishment of the St. James police station, the landmark National Academy of the Performing Arts in Port of Spain, the accompanying Southern Academy of the Performing Arts in San Fernando, the Shanghai Construction-built velodrome and aquatics center, the South terminal of the Piarco International Airport (renovated for the Summit of the Americas, which Trinidad and Tobago hosted in 2009), and the Couva Children\u2019s Hospital (whose completed shell remains unused).\u00a0 In the energy sector, in 2011, China Investment Corporation (the PRC sovereign wealth fund), invested $850 million to acquire a 10 percent interest in Atlantic LNG.\u00a0 Beyond business dealings, the PRC established its second Confucius institute in the region at the University of the West Indies St. Augustine campus. Such institutes, of which there are currently six in the Caribbean, are the official PRC vehicle for the teaching of the Chinese language and the promotion of Chinese culture, employing PRC professors funded by the Chinese government. Trinidad and Tobago was also the first government in the region to buy a major China-built military ship. Its capital, Port of Spain, was chosen by the Chinese government to host bilateral meetings with nine Caribbean leaders, including the country\u2019s Prime Minister, when then newly-elected President Xi Jinping traveled to the region in June 2013. Building on this strong base, PRC political and business ties with Trinidad and Tobago have continued to expand over the past two decades, even with alternation in power between the country\u2019s two major political parties. Today\u2019s numerous PRC-built public buildings and other infrastructure projects are generally considered to have started with Prime Minister Patrick Manning and his People\u2019s National Movement (PNM) government (2001-2010). They continued to expand when the PNM was replaced by the United National Congress (UNC) coalition of Kamla Persad-Bissessar in 2010, and grew even more when the PNM returned to power under current Prime Minister Keith Rowley. Although far removed from trade routes to Asia, in May 2018, Trinidad and Tobago became one of the first nations in the Caribbean to join the PRC \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d signing a memorandum of understanding whose content and commitments were never made known, presumably to strengthen the nation\u2019s tenuous ties to Chinese markets, loans, and investments. During Prime Minister Rowley\u2019s May 2018 trip to the PRC, where he signed the agreement, he secured a commitment from the Chinese to purchase a symbolically important albeit unspecified quantity of paving material from the local Lake Asphalt corporation to pave the runways of the new Beijing airport. Since late 2018, the pressures on the Rowley government to work with Chinese firms have grown through the closure of the Petrotrin refinery. The closure put approximately 5,200 people directly employed by the facility out of work in the vicinity of country\u2019s third major city, San Fernando, and indirectly affected thousands of others. In the context of the government\u2019s scramble to find jobs for the thousands put out of work by the closure of Petrotrin, it has made a commitment to China Harbour Engineering Corporation to build a $500 million dry-dock facility in La Brea, part of the area affected by the Petrotrin closure. Although China Harbour already has a major presence throughout the Caribbean and representatives in Port of Spain, the drydock would be its first major project and opportunity to establish a foothold in the country. Expanding engagement and dangerous precedent As has occurred with other governments which have hastily agreed to incur debt in contracting Chinese firms to build public works projects\u2014most famously the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota\u2014it is not clear whether the location and other characteristics of the drydock will be sufficiently attractive for shipping companies to do major repairs at the new facility. On the other hand, the China Harbour commitment to fund 30 percent of the project with its own resources raises the prospect whether it has a plan in coordination with the Chinese shipping line COSCO or others to do their work there. Beyond the drydock, the Rowley government is also discussing work with Beijing Construction and Engineering Group (BCEG) (already involved in the Curepe highway interchange project), to build an industrial park, \u201cPhoenix Park Industrial Estate,\u201d at nearby Point Lisas. In exchange for the government\u2019s payment of approximately $104 million to BCEG to develop the site, financed by China\u2019s Import-Export Bank, BCEG has suggested that it could attract 10 major PRC-based companies to set up operations at the site, and possibly bring as many as 60 Chinese firms to the site over the long term, generating up to 4,500 jobs. It is not clear, however, that after BCEG completes the work and the Trinidad and Tobago government incurs the debt, the promised Chinese investors will materialize, or whether they will require the government to grant them special tax incentives and exemptions from labor and other laws to come to the country. The Trinidad and Tobago government has previously tried to attract Chinese industrial investments, and such attempts have ended badly. In 2008, it secured a $400 million financing commitment from China Ex-Im bank for the $600 million project to establish an aluminum smelting operation, Alutrint, and the Chinese brought on 200 workers to advance the operation. The project was cancelled in 2010, however, when the incoming UNC government did not find that the project complied with environmental requirements. While the Rowley government has suggested that some kind of Chinese aluminum operation may still be possible, the Chinese have a $100 million possible claim for damages arising from the prior ill-fated project. If the proposed Phoenix Park industrial park does succeed in attracting the hoped-for Chinese companies, they would likely use the nearby port of Point Lisas to import factor inputs and export products. The expanded volume of port throughput, and its use by Chinese firms, in turn, could tempt the Chinese state-owned shipping company COSCO to consider expanding the service it currently offers to Port of Spain to also make a stop in Point Lisas, competing for the new business with CMA-CGM and smaller shipping companies currently servicing the port. Beyond these two key projects, the Rowley government has also committed to contract Shanghai Construction Group (responsible for many of the previously mentioned buildings and infrastructure projects), to build a new 540-bed wing for the Port of Spain General Hospital, to replace one damaged by a recent earthquake. Work on the new wing is scheduled to begin in September 2019. Shanghai Construction is currently in the midst of constructing its new regional headquarters in Port of Spain, conveniently located next door to a U.S. Embassy residence. As has occurred elsewhere in the Caribbean, the Trinidad and Tobago government also hoped to contract the Chinese firm HNA, or other Chinese companies, to build a 5-star, 750-bed resort in the Golden Grove area of Tobago. The project was seen as particularly important to attract tourism in the less-developed island of Tobago, where one government-built hotel, the Magdalena, has languished for years after losing its brand-sponsor, Hilton. While the Trinidad and Tobago government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the luxury hotel brand Sandals to guide development of the hotel, the latter decided in early 2019 to withdraw from the project, citing negative publicity. With respect to the petroleum sector, the shutdown of the Petrotrin refinery has also created the possibility that the government may reach out to Chinese banks to help secure $1.4 billion in loans to refinance looming bond payments for the refinery, including an $850 million bond coming due in 2019, and a $750 million bond coming due in 2021. There have also been rumors of Chinese interest in acquiring the refinery itself, which has some sophisticated capabilities, important for fully refining the heavy, high-sulfur oil produced in neighboring Venezuela. Senior oil industry executives consulted for this work could not, however, confirm that the Chinese were exploring that possibility. In the telecommunications sector, the Chinese firm Huawei, as well as its Chinese rival ZTE, has established a strong position in the Trinidad and Tobago market. Huawei performs infrastructure work for the Irish telecommunications provider Digicel, as well as for TSTT, in which the Trinidad and Tobago government is the majority (51 percent) partner. Huawei has also been successful in selling its smartphones and other telecommunications devices in the local market. Thus, in terms of both phones and the lines that carry their data, virtually all sensitive, proprietary and personal data transmitted by Trinidad and Tobago government personnel, local and foreign businessmen, and others in the country, passes through Huawei hardware at some point in its journey. In the transportation sector, beyond the COSCO shipping service to Port of Spain, and the 2009 modernization of the Piarco airport, the government and Caribbean Airlines have signed a cooperation agreement with China\u2019s Hainan Airlines, which would make Trinidad and Tobago more accessible from the PRC for Chinese officials, businessmen, and tourists. With respect to consumer products, the Chinese automobile and truck company Great Wall has long had a presence in the country, while auto and truck makers Foton and JAC have, more recently, established very large facilities south of Port of Spain. Despite such advances, however, Chinese cars and trucks have not yet begun appearing on the streets of the country in significant numbers. In parallel, the Chinese bus manufacturer Higer has sold a limited number of vehicles to Trinidad and Tobago, with an order for 300 more Higer buses reportedly in the works. In the defense and security sector, the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force was the first in all of the Western Hemisphere to purchase a Chinese-made military ship, an Offshore Patrol Vessel. In November 2018, the Trinidad and Tobago Police Force received a gift of 250 Chinese motorcycles, although it is unclear where or how they are being used. Growing PRC-Trinidad and Tobago state-to-state and business ties are affected by the sizeable ethnic Chinese community whose roots in the country go back more than a century. As with elsewhere in the Caribbean, that community is generally respected, but has limited engagement with other components of Trinidad and Tobago society beyond the contact with the non-Chinese community through its restaurants and shops, known for their long operating hours and reasonable prices. Indeed, a public event that I attended in San Fernando, sponsored by the local Chamber of Commerce, was not attended by a single businessman of Chinese descent, even though Chinese Trinidadians reportedly make up approximately 20 percent of the greater San Fernando population. As has occurred elsewhere in the Caribbean, the importation of Chinese workers by PRC-based construction companies on temporary work visas to support their projects appears to have contributed to a substantial increase in the number of Chinese in the country, with many incorporated into relatively enclosed Chinese communities into which the Trinidad and Tobago authorities have almost no visibility. Trinidad and Tobago-based analysts with whom I spoke during this and prior visits expressed concern over gambling and other illicit activities that occur in some Chinese establishments. Illicit activities within the Trinidad and Tobago Chinese community also include extra-official versions of the national lottery draw game Play Whe (with money collected by, and paid out of Chinese shops without paying the associated national taxes), as well as the character-based Chinese game-of-chance \u201cWei Wei.\u201d Some consulted for this work suggest that such gambling plays an important role in laundering money (particularly U.S. dollars). Perhaps even more troubling, the February 2019 discovery of a prostitution ring involving 19 Venezuelan women run out of a high-end Chinese establishment suggests that Chinese criminal groups, previously isolated from non-Chinese Trinidadian society, may be entering new areas of illicit business, such as the exploitation of the estimated 60,000 Venezuelan refugees currently in the country, through prostitution and other activities. Implications for the U.S.  Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s deepening engagement with the PRC needs to be on the radar of U.S. policymakers in Washington, particularly as the incumbent Rowley government engages in increasingly bombastic rhetoric and positions increasingly unhelpful to the maintenance of security and rule of law in the region\u2014particularly the Maduro regime and its associated criminal actors and armed groups in Venezuela.\u00a0 It would be fruitless and counterproductive for the U.S. to prevent Trinidad and Tobago or other countries from doing business with the PRC. The U.S. can, however, expand the attention given to this strategically important Caribbean country. The U.S. can also help strengthen the country\u2019s capacity to negotiate effectively with the Chinese (and others), and to make smart and financially well-grounded decisions that help the Trinidad and Tobago government leverage the opportunities that loans and investment from and China and others can provide, to ensure that the projects contracted most effectively advance national development objectives.\u00a0 U.S. help, if respectfully offered and accepted by the Rowley government, could include expanded support for programs to help the country most rationally plan a logical series of investments, grounded in sound business cases and objective value analysis. The U.S. government can also expand programs to help the Trinidad and Tobago government more effectively conduct open competitive procurement, including the evaluation of the legal and technical aspects of proposals and contracts by Chinese and other companies. Beyond such initiatives, the U.S. should continue to encourage the Trinidad and Tobago government to maintain transparency in its negotiations, to ensure that the terms of the deals that it makes reflect the best interests of the people of the country, without side benefits to persons affiliated with the negotiators. The U.S. can strengthen the capabilities of the Trinidad and Tobago government to monitor compliance with the agreements achieved, including the greatest possible number of jobs for residents of the country, adherence to national labor laws, and compliance with environmental regulations and the technical terms of agreements to ensure that the performance of the contract produces the expected benefits to the country. Finally, at the political level, the U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago may wish to consider a reset of their increasingly tense relationship.\u00a0 A visit to the country by senior U.S. officials such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, or U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, accompanied by respectful, but frank dialogue, could be an effective way to start. The U.S. is not only strongly connected to Trinidad and Tobago by ties of geography, commerce and family; it has been a close partner to the country for far too long for the relationship to degenerate through escalating populist rhetoric and recriminations that might push Trinidad and Tobago to deepen its embrace of the PRC in ways that would neither be beneficial to the United States, nor for the people of Trinidad and Tobago.

            "text": " Beijing's new Five-Year Plan (2021-25), presented before the ongoing National People's Congress, has given the nod for the first dam on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. It will be the first instance of hydroelectric power dam construction activity on the stretch of the river that lies close to the Indian border in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). The Indian daily The Hindu reported that the draft of the 14th Five-Year Plan clearly states the construction of the project as being among the long-range objectives of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). According to the daily, the Five-Year Plan\u00a0will be approved at the conclusion of the National People's Congress on Thursday. The 4,696-km-long river (commonly known in India as the Brahmaputra River) enters India from China in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, then goes through\u00a0Assam\u00a0before it enters Bangladesh and joins the Ganges. The joint rivers ultimately end their course by emptying into the Bay of Bengal. While Beijing has built dams on the upper and middle stretches of the river, reports about a proposed \"Super Dam\" on the lower reaches of the river first appeared in Chinese state media in December of last year. According to a Global Times report in December, the \"massive\" 60 GW (gigawatt) capacity dam on the lower stream of the Yarlung Tsangpo, described as having \"no parallel\" in history by Yan Zhiyong, the chair of the Power Construction Corp of China, will help Beijin in meeting its Paris Climate Accord goals of achieving zero carbon emissions by 2030. The report about the \"super dam\" raised alarm bells in India, with the federal Water Resources Ministry telling Reuters in December that New Delhi was mulling another 10 GW dam to offset the impact of the Chinese Super Dam upstream. The proposed Chinese dam on the lowest stream of the Yarlung Tsangpo River will have little impact on the amount of water flowing into India. But it will have significant bearing on the flow pattern of the river, environmentalist\u00a0Himanshu Thakkar, the coordinator of New Delhi-based South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, and People (SANDRP), told Sputnik. He said the Chinese dam was proposed on the lowest of the three streams of Yarlung Tsangpo, which accounts for only 20-25 percent of the overall volume of water getting into India. \"Since the river is known for carrying one of the highest volumes of water among all the rivers, there would be hardly any impact on lower riparian states such as India and Bangladesh on the front\", explained Thakkar. He, however, added with caution that the \"change in flow pattern\" could have major bearing for India, China's immediate neighbour. \"The project will have little to no impact on Bangladesh on any parameter\", said Thakkar. He explained that the flow pattern refers to the rate of water flow, which \"could vary unpredictably\" once the Chinese dam comes up upstream. Thakkar further cautioned that the \"amount of silt\" flowing in the river once it enters Indian territory could be significantly reduced by the upcoming Chinese dam. \"Silt is known for its benefits to farmers. On the Indian side, many (people) around the river depend upon the fertile lands around the river for their livelihoods\". On the back of New Delhi's concerns about the new dam, Chinese Embassy\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Ji Rong said that Beijing would \"take the interests\" of other riparian states into consideration before planning any hydro projects on the Himalayan river.

            "text": " Significant Asian investments into South America\u2019s hydro market continue with the purchase of Peru\u2019s 456-MW Chaglla plant by a consortium led by the China Three Gorges Corp. The deal, which also includes China\u2019s Hubei Energy Group Co. Ltd., comes as Chaglla\u2018s current owner, Odebrecht SA, is embroiled in a massive corruption scandal that includes more than US$2.6 billion in penalties and outright bans from bidding in some South American markets. Chaglla was developed by a subsidiary of the Brazilian Odebrecht called Empresa de Generacion Huallaga SA. The Chinese consortium is reported to be paying $1.39 billion for the facility, which is located on the Huallaga River in the Chaglla and Chinchao districts. HydroWorld.com previously reported Chaglla was built in part with $150 million in funding from the Inter-American Development Bank\u00a0and Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. The deal must still be approved by Peruvian and Chinese authorities, but should be approved given the sale will help Odebrecht pay off its debts. Increasing interest from China Already, China Three Gorges has, through a number of subsidiaries, broken into the Brazilian market, with ventures including operating concessions for the\u00a0700-MW Sao Manoel project via the CWE Investment Corp., and the 3,444-MW Ilha Solteira and 1,550-MW Jupia\u00a0through CTG Brasil. But, China Three Gorges is not alone in taking an active interest in South America\u2019s hydro sector by financing, constructing, outfitting and operating projects. Earlier this week, China\u2019s Sinohydro announced it had been awarded a contract to construct Bolivia\u2019s 280-MW Iviriu plant, and the conglomerate completed Ecuador\u2019s 1,500-MW Coca Coda Sinclair last November. The company is also part of a consortium building the 240-MW Chicoasen 2 plant in Mexico and 124-MW San Jose in Bolivia. Also in Peru this week Developer RC Hydro has received approval from the Minsitry of Mines and Energy for the 40-MW Churo plant, which would draw waters from the Canete and Huantan rivers in Yauyos province. If constructed, the run-of-river plant will cost more than $60 million, with work to take about two years to complete. RC Hydro must still secure other approvals, however, before it can begin building. Copyright \u00a9 2019 - 2021"

EDT Aug 11, 2021 | 2:24 PM EDT Aug 9, 2021 | 5:29 PM EDT Aug 9, 2021 | 1:29 PM EDT Back in February, Google announced it would roll out a new \u2018Fit Mobile Vitals\u2019 feature to Google Fit on Pixel phones. The feature would allow users to monitor their heart and respiratory rate using just the camera on their phone. Now, it looks like that feature could roll out starting March 8th. According to Android Police, the heart and respiratory monitoring will arrive first for Pixel phones, and later for other Android devices. However, the publication notes that Google didn\u2019t provide any schedule or details about hardware or software requirements, so it\u2019s not clear how much longer it\u2019ll be until the feature arrives for non-Pixel users. On top of that, Android Police was reportedly told that the feature would come to \u201call supported Pixels,\u201d but it\u2019s not clear if that means the Pixel 2 line. Considering that the Pixel 2 and 2 XL no longer receive software updates, I\u2019d guess they won\u2019t get the feature, but I could be wrong. If you\u2019re curious how Google Fit will be able to monitor your heart rate and breathing rate with just your phone camera, it\u2019s actually a pretty neat system.  For heart rate, users just need to cover the camera sensor on their phone and apply light pressure. The phone will shine the LED flash to light up your finger while the camera picks up on subtle colour changes called \u201cpulsatile photoplethysmographic signals.\u201d If you\u2019ve ever held a flashlight up your finger to make it glow red, this is basically what the Google Fit app does, except it checks for slight changes in the colour to measure your pulse. It\u2019s worth noting this feature isn\u2019t exactly new \u2014 the Withings (which was previously bought by Nokia but is now back to being Withings) Health Mate app lets you measure your pulse in the same way.  Measuring your respiratory rate is a bit different. That measurement requires propping up your phone so you can see your head and chest with the selfie camera. Google Fit records your breathing and measures the movements of your chest to calculate your breaths per minute. Google says it processes all this on-device, so users shouldn\u2019t have to worry about random recordings of them breathing ending up on a Google server somewhere. Pixel owners should keep an eye out for these features to arrive in the coming days.

Everyone has access to rapid Covid tests and they are easy to do from the comfort of your own home, giving a result between 15 and 30 minutes. The public have been advised to take the tests twice a week to detect those carrying the virus. The tests are key to keeping society moving by helping drive down spread of the disease, the Government says. While they are not 100 per cent accurate, they catch the most infectious cases, even if you don't feel ill. That means you can then stay at home and not infect anyone else. Places of work and businesses across the country now require employees to take these tests, to make sure they can keep operating. Using the lateral flow tests is also one way you can secure a Covid passport to events. Many places now require proof of a negative lateral flow test 48 hours before an event, or two coronavirus vaccines. \ud83d\udd35 Read our coronavirus live blog\u00a0for the latest updates  A Covid lateral flow test uses a swab from a patient's nose or throat to quickly determine if they are infected with coronavirus.  They are being used to check if people have the virus but are not showing symptoms. By catching these people it means they can isolate at home and not spread the virus. Around one in three people with coronavirus don\u2019t have symptoms, which means they could be spreading the virus without knowing. Head online to this website - where you can request a pack of tests to use at home. The testing kit comes with instructions and is fairly simple to use. It first involves taking a swab of the throat and nose and dipping it into a solution. This is then placed onto a paper pad on the device - that looks like a pregnancy stick. Inside the device is a strip of test paper that changes colour if coronavirus proteins are in the sample.  Usually, one line next to the \"C\" means negative, two lines next to \"C\" and \"T\" means positive, and no lines or one next to \"T\" means the test is void. Use this service to report your result to the NHS after using a rapid lateral flow test kit to check if you\u2019re infectious with coronavirus (COVID-19). Report the result every time you use a rapid lateral flow test kit and as soon as possible after you get the result. You cannot report a result after more than 24 hours. You can only report one result at a time. You need to have the barcode on the test strip or the ID number printed under it and a mobile phone number to get a test confirming the result. It is the same for reporting your children's results. You can also report results to NHS Test and Trace on the same day they take it, either by inputting their results online or by calling 119. Lateral flow tests are not as reliable as the PCR tests used by the NHS. The Department of Health says the tests have been rigorously assessed by scientists. This means they are \"accurate, reliable and successfully identify those with Covid-19 who don\u2019t show symptoms\". But the tests were not designed to look for Covid in people without symptoms, but for people who did have symptoms.  It means the results are not 100 per cent correct. The Government website states that \"when a person has low levels of virus in their system, lateral flow tests are less sensitive than some of the other tests we use, such as PCR tests\". Yes, you can buy Covid lateral flow tests online.  However, the accuracy of an online test kit that has not been approved by a regulator cannot be guaranteed and a test result could be incorrect. There are plenty of free kits available through the Government site or even possibly through your employer, so you shouldn't have to buy your own.

            "text": " DETROIT - It was March 11 last year when Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced that the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade was canceled because a virus that had already sickened tens of thousands worldwide had reached Michigan. On March 11, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced the St. Patrick's Day parade would be canceled. It was fast action, but it may have saved thousands.  (Photo courtesy of Amber Ainsworth) \"All those folks standing shoulder to shoulder for hours, it was a recipe for the spread of the problem,\" Duggan told reporters at the time. He said it would be \"a matter of days\" before a city resident was infected. He was right. COVID-19 hit Detroit hard. But fast action by city leaders early in the pandemic may have slowed the rampant advance of the virus among Detroit\u2019s largely Black population. Detroit recorded 431 confirmed COVID cases on March 30, 2020, and another 387 two days later, according to the city\u2019s Health Department. There were 49 confirmed deaths on April 1, another 51 on April 9 and 52 on April 16. \"We know Detroit was one of the first in the nation to be hit by COVID,\" said Renuka Tipirneni, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. \"People live in more crowded housing, need public transportation to get to work in essential jobs.\" But Detroit fought to get its residents tested for the virus early on, and had \"a very targeted and robust messaging campaign,\" said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan\u2019s chief medical executive. Duggan appeared on Facebook, YouTube and TV, urging residents to mask up, social distance and stay home. He made Detroit among the first cities in the U.S. to deploy Abbott Laboratories tests that provide results in minutes, allowing police and firefighters to avoid quarantine if they tested negative after possible exposure. Detroit also instituted free, mass drive-thru testing at the former state fairgrounds. Virus testing was conducted at homeless shelters, too. \"The actions of the city of Detroit did save lives,\" Khaldun told The Associated Press. \"People who needed a test, got a test. People had the right information about the virus and how to protect themselves against the virus. That\u2019s where you are going to see virus numbers come down.\" But Detroit hasn\u2019t escaped tragedy. More than 30,000 cases have been confirmed in the city, and close to 1,900 residents have died. In late August, Belle Isle \u2014 a state park in the Detroit River \u2014 was transformed into a memorial for grieving families who slowly drove past hundreds of photos of loved ones who had succumbed to the virus. People of color nationwide have been disproportionately infected and killed by the virus, and most of the faces in the photos on Belle Isle were Black. Nearly eight out of 10 of Detroit\u2019s 670,000 residents are African American. The elderly and poor are also susceptible. About 20% of Detroiters are age 60 and older. Detroit\u2019s poverty rate is among the nation\u2019s highest. By the second week in April, Duggan said the \"center of the battle\" was in Detroit nursing homes after 11 deaths and 141 confirmed infections. The city launched daily rapid testing of nursing home residents and staff. This \"was a good strategy,\" said 60-year-old Sherry Evans, whose 81-year-old mother, Ilene Hegler, suffered from dementia and was then living in a nursing home outside Detroit. \"The nursing home contacted me around April 18-19 saying she had a fever,\" said Evans, of Dearborn Heights. \"They called me back and said she tested positive. They called me back again and said they couldn\u2019t beat the fever.\" Her mother died April 21. \"They were more sensitive in Detroit that the virus was killing older people and Blacks,\" Evans said. The city reported around 149 new COVID-19 cases and about 20 deaths on April 23. Newly confirmed cases on July 1 numbered around 39, and health officials started seeing fewer daily deaths. But cases began trending up in late fall. On Nov. 30 \u2014 following the Thanksgiving holiday \u2014 about 329 new cases were confirmed. The numbers have since dropped. \"I think (Duggan\u2019s) leadership, along with that of the Black church, both played major roles,\" said the Rev. Kenneth Flowers, who lives outside Detroit, but whose Greater New Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church is in the heart of the city. The city worked with churches and other organizations to preach the importance of masking up, said Flowers, who along with his wife, two daughters, sisters and 90-year-old mother have all recovered from the virus. \"We did testing in our church,\" Flowers said. \"It saddens and angers me when I see a lot of people in certain areas not wearing their masks and not taking it seriously.\" When the city began receiving vaccine doses in December, it opened up a downtown convention center garage for drive-thru vaccinations for people ages 75 and older, before dropping the age limit. The city is \"realizing the importance of meeting people where they are,\" said Rashawn Ray, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in Governance Studies at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, who co-authored a report on COVID-19 in Detroit. \"Drive-thrus are exactly what should be happening.\" An Associated Press analysis of vaccination data from 17 states and two cities that released racial breakdowns through Jan. 25 shows fewer Black people being inoculated than the rest of the population. Duggan said he has received a commitment from President Joe Biden\u2019s White House for 15,000 weekly doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The city has administered more than 100,000 vaccination doses. Duggan also said the city will make the Johnson & Johnson vaccine available. For those reporting their race, about 82% of those who have received at least one shot are Black. Robert Huguley, a 74-year-old Black man who lives in Detroit, was vaccinated last month at the TCF Center. Advertisement \"I think they\u2019re doing the best they can,\" he said of the city\u2019s efforts to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible. \"We need more vaccine. Without the vaccine there\u2019s not a lot you can do.\" This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92021 FOX Television Stations"

The deal, which also includes China\u2019s Hubei Energy Group Co. Ltd., comes as Chaglla\u2018s current owner, Odebrecht SA, is embroiled in a massive corruption scandal that includes more than US$2.6 billion in penalties and outright bans from bidding in some South American markets. Chaglla was developed by a subsidiary of the Brazilian Odebrecht called Empresa de Generacion Huallaga SA. The Chinese consortium is reported to be paying $1.39 billion for the facility, which is located on the Huallaga River in the Chaglla and Chinchao districts. HydroWorld.com previously reported Chaglla was built in part with $150 million in funding from the Inter-American Development Bank\u00a0and Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. The deal must still be approved by Peruvian and Chinese authorities, but should be approved given the sale will help Odebrecht pay off its debts. Increasing interest from China Already, China Three Gorges has, through a number of subsidiaries, broken into the Brazilian market, with ventures including operating concessions for the\u00a0700-MW Sao Manoel project via the CWE Investment Corp., and the 3,444-MW Ilha Solteira and 1,550-MW Jupia\u00a0through CTG Brasil. But, China Three Gorges is not alone in taking an active interest in South America\u2019s hydro sector by financing, constructing, outfitting and operating projects. Earlier this week, China\u2019s Sinohydro announced it had been awarded a contract to construct Bolivia\u2019s 280-MW Iviriu plant, and the conglomerate completed Ecuador\u2019s 1,500-MW Coca Coda Sinclair last November. The company is also part of a consortium building the 240-MW Chicoasen 2 plant in Mexico and 124-MW San Jose in Bolivia. Also in Peru this week Developer RC Hydro has received approval from the Minsitry of Mines and Energy for the 40-MW Churo plant, which would draw waters from the Canete and Huantan rivers in Yauyos province. If constructed, the run-of-river plant will cost more than $60 million, with work to take about two years to complete. RC Hydro must still secure other approvals, however, before it can begin building. Copyright \u00a9 2019 - 2021"

The Daule-Vinces water transfer scheme in Guayas and Los Rios provinces is one of Ecuador\u2019s national water projects to control irrigation and floodwaters. Photo by C\u00e9sar Mu\u00f1oz / ANDES via Flickr Creative Commons. A localized El Ni\u00f1o continues to batter countries along South America\u2019s Pacific Coast, but communities in Ecuador have been relatively unscathed compared to those in neighboring Peru. When asked why, government officials, including President Rafael Correa, point to a series of dams, reservoirs, dikes, and break walls installed in the Ca\u00f1ar, Guayas, and Naranjal river basins that divert water away from towns and farmland. Still, emergencies caused by floods and landslides spiked in Quito  following record rainfall, and the government declared disaster areas in four provinces this month.   \u201cLook how much it\u2019s impacting Peru, the same storm that we are suffering ourselves. This isn\u2019t about luck, it\u2019s about planning, hard work, and good investment, which provides the best savings.  This is saving us hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d \u2014 Rafael Correa, president of Ecuador, praising his country\u2019s flood defense systems during a visit this month to El Triunfo in Guayas province. Ecuador built the infrastructure in response to a strong, global El Ni\u00f1o in 1997 and 1998 that inundated vast areas of Guayas and Ca\u00f1ar provinces. A coastal El Ni\u00f1o this year has rained destruction on Peru, but there is comparatively little damage in Ecuador. 45,000 hectares flooded in Ca\u00f1ar province and the Naranjal River Basin during a 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o. The event killed 286 people in Ecuador.  349 kilometers of protective dikes are part of six major flood control projects designed in response to the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o. The projects include a 23-kilometer bypass canal that can divert 1,500 cubic meters of water per second into the Gulf of Guayaquil. Together with the dikes and a series of pumping stations and reservoirs, the canal protects 655,000 people and 285,000 hectares in the Ca\u00f1ar, Guayas, and Narangal river basins, according to Ecuador\u2019s Public Water Company.  18 people killed by floods and related disasters during Ecuador\u2019s rainy season this year. The rains also injured more than 1,200 people, affected more than 8,500 families, and destroyed 144 homes and seven bridges.    4 provinces declared disaster areas by the Ecuador government this month. They are Esmeraldas, Guayas, Manabi, and Santa Elena. An \u201corange alert\u201d was issued for the provinces of El Oro, Loja, and Los Rios, activating local emergency operation committees to prepare for potential disasters.   493 emergency incidents reported in Quito this rainy season, including floods, collapsed houses, and fallen trees, according to the city\u2019s Emergency Operations Center.   30 to 40 percent reduction in productivity at several public work projects in Quito due to delays caused by heavy rains. The rains also forced contractors to use drainage and pumping systems to reduce water accumulation in the Quito Metro, which is under construction.  More than double the normal amount of rain fell in March across Azuay, Cotopaxi, and Pichincha provinces, and rainfall reached 73 percent above normal in Guayas province, according to data released this week by the Secretary of Risk Management. Several stations in Quito, located in Pichincha province, registered record levels of rainfall this month. By comparison, the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o dropped nearly 10 times the average amount of rain on Ecuador and Peru.  Under long-term climate change scenarios, scientists expect rainfall extremes to become more common along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru, raising the risk of floods and landslides. At the same time, shrinking glaciers in the Andes could harm Ecuador\u2019s p\u00e1ramos grasslands, which help store and regulate water flows. Glaciers in the tropical Andes shrank an average of 30 to 50 percent over the past four decades.   Heavy rains and storms are expected to continue through the end of the month, particularly along Ecuador\u2019s central and southern coast. The national committee that tracks El Ni\u00f1o conditions will meet again to update forecasts on March 30.

(CASA) has signed a concession contract with\u00a0the Peruvian Ministry of Transport and Communications for the\u00a0Amazon waterway (Hidrov\u00eda Amaz\u00f3nica) PPP project. As we reported,\u00a0Peru's private investment promotion agency\u00a0ProInversi\u00f3n\u00a0awarded the project\u00a0to the\u00a0Hidrov\u00edas II consortium in July 2017. The consortium will be responsible for the\u00a0design, build, finance, operation and maintenance (DBFOM)\u00a0of the waterway for a period of\u00a020 years. The total project investment is\u00a0estimated at US$95 million. Jan De Nul Group\u00a0and\u00a0China Communications Construction Company\u00a0Limited (CCCC)\u00a0also submitted\u00a0proposals for the project. The project\u00a0comprises the implementation of\u00a0works and actions to\u00a0improve the navigability\u00a0and transit of\u00a0passenger and cargo traffic through the\u00a0Amazonas, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Huallaga\u00a0and Ucayali rivers. The project\u00a0involves dredging on critical areas and on the access\u00a0to the Port of Iquitos, implementation of a GPS information system on the navigation\u00a0channel, installation of level measuring stations with transmission\u00a0of information, implementation of a system of monitoring of navigability conditions and a cleaning system. The\u00a0Amazon River System\u00a0provides the main transportation means in the Amazon region of Peru, due to its natural characteristics and to the lack of technical and financial opportunities to implement other means of transportation. Comprising more than 6,000 kilometers of waterways, the River System embraces more than 90% of the passengers and cargo transportation in the region, thus becoming one of the principal means of development for trade and generation of wealth.

            "text": " Today is International Women\u2019s Day - a day when we celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. The Bishop\u2019s Appeal this year is partnering the Anglican Communion's microfinance charity Five Talents to support communities in our link diocese of Marsabit in Northern Kenya. Over the next year, the appeal will be empowering women in Marsabit as they continue to challenge the prevailing gender norms by training and equipping local people in savings schemes, literacy, numeracy and business skills to enable them to live more abundant lives. Did you know that\u00a080% of those who Five Talent\u2019s reach with their transformational work in East Africa are women? Thanks to the work of education and savings groups\u00a073% of female members now able to cope during emergencies and 97% of members reported being able to afford three meals a day.\u00a0 The stories below illustrate how these local training and saving schemes are transforming the lives of women in Kenya. Please celebrate international women\u2019s day with us by donating to the Bishop\u2019s Appeal to empower more women. Make a donation\u00a0 \u00a0 This is one of the gatherings of a savings group in East Africa. Meetings usually happen outside under a tree or in the local church. Often the groups open meetings with a song, prayer, or Bible reading - each group decides together! This group began with the chairlady reading a passage from the Bible in the local language. Next, the local trainers discuss the day\u2019s lesson with the group. This will vary with each group we work with, and by how far along into the curriculum they are. Some days business training may be delivered on diversifying products, while other days groups may be learning how to budget and save or practise literacy and numeracy. In Marsabit only 26% of women are literate. Women rely on the men in their communities for the simplest of things like shopping and paying school fees.\u00a0 Sadly, many men are out for long stretches grazing cattle and sourcing income. The women left behind are suffering. These savings groups give access to education, basic skills and eventually a cohort of other likeminded women in their community who they can borrow, save and share with. The group members take part in the lesson using a chalkboard and practice books. The trainers guide them through the lesson. Sometimes they will create problem trees, recite the alphabet or even learn how to hold a pencil! After the lesson concludes, it\u2019s time to start saving and borrowing. Each member will bring their monthly savings contribution to the group\u2019s leadership, who will record it in their passbooks. Every member has their own passbook to log their total savings, loans and repayments. The group\u2019s treasurer and secretary count and confirms the amount and (if necessary) our local trainers will also assist group members with this process. As savings are being recorded, members with loans will also make repayments. Then the group turns to issuing new loans. This always happens in front of the group so that all members are aware and each member with a loan can be held accountable. The group makes decisions together on who receives a loan and what happens if a member cannot repay.\u00a0 Most groups have an \u2018emergency fund\u2019 too - at each meeting, members contribute a small amount which can be used to make emergency grants or loans to any member facing a sudden crisis such as a hospital bill. Some groups extend this support to those in need in the wider community too. Any fines levied by the group (eg for arriving late at the meeting) often go into the emergency fund too, or are sometimes used to buy sodas or other treats at Christmas or when guests are visiting. In very rural areas, where there is no bank within reach, all of the money collected is put in a lockbox along with the passbooks. The box has three padlocks and three members take home a key each whilst a fourth keeps the box. The box is not opened again until the next meeting. But if there is a bank, bank agent or mobile money agent nearby, two of the group will go together to deposit the funds in the group\u2019s bank account. For some groups, a secure bank van comes to collect the money so our trainers and group leaders do not have to carry the money themselves, reducing the risks of harm, such as robbery.\u00a0 After savings & loans have been accounted for, the group will discuss any further issues - the group provides a safe place for members to talk about business ideas, problems at home, or simply have fellowship. Our members always say how much they value this solidarity aspect of the group. When the group finishes they often conclude with a song. You can see the immense impact social support, training and financial services has on an entire community! \u00a0 Carol is the secretary of a Savings Group in her village in Kenya. She has received the largest loan of the Group, worth 400,000 Ksh (\u00a32,700). Carol decided to use the loan to build a kindergarten in her community. The school was opened in January 2018 and has 43 students and employs 10 staff members from the local community. Carol was delighted to share her school with us; she is incredibly grateful. Without the support of her Savings Group and the training she received through our programme, Carol would not have been able to build the school and help the community. Carol told our team that she hopes that Five Talents continues to grow and serve the other members of her community. In the future she would like to take out a loan to expand the kindergarten for primary (and even secondary one day!) age children to attend school and also to buy a bus, making commutes easier for children and their families. The school is covered in bright colours, and radiates joy from the students and staff, though there are heavy, secure gates around the outside. Microfinance made the school possible, but Carol\u2019s bright idea and creative eye makes the school a beacon to the community. \u00a0 This blog post was written by Creative Communications & Events Officer from Five\u00a0Talents, Megan Henderson, with photos taken by Jean Bizimana from Taking Pictures, Changing Lives.

            "text": " \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Engineers and indigenous people call for proper studies on Cohidro navigability project that could impact fish populations and local livelihoods \nDan Collyns September 13, 2019\n  Share Communities in Peru that depend on the river for fish and transport say the Amazon Waterway project could affect their livelihoods (image: Anna & Michal) The world\u2019s mightiest river, the Amazon, originates in Peru and now the country has a plan to transform it, along with the major tributaries within its borders, into a hub for permanent, faster and more modern transport. The Amazon Waterway is a multimillion-dollar project to dredge the four most important rivers in Peru\u2019s rainforest region and use satellite navigation and GPS to make transport more secure. However, the US$95 million government-backed project, known in Spanish as the\u00a0Hidrov\u00eda Amaz\u00f3nica,\u00a0depends on the approval of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before it can begin opening up 2,687 kilometres of the Mara\u00f1on, Ucayali, Huallaga and Amazon rivers. The Cohidro consortium, a 50/50 partnership between Chinese engineering firm Sinohydro Corp Ltd and Peruvian construction firm Casa S.A, was contracted to engineer the project in 2017. If it gets the green light in a decision expected at the end of this year, a 20-year concession would likely begin in 2022 when the waterway would become operational. The Amazon Waterway has been declared of national interest. Peru\u2019s transport and communications ministry earmarked it as one of 52 key infrastructure projects to plug what the finance ministry estimates is a US$108 billion infrastructure shortfall, equivalent to\u00a0around half the country's GDP. However, the path to the final approval of this project may not be plain sailing. The plan, which purports to make the Amazon region more navigable, has raised environmental concerns and unanswered questions about its objectives. First proposed in 2014 as part of the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (IIRSA), the waterway attracted its first Chinese and Peruvian investors, El Consorcio Hidrovias II, in 2017. The river is an integrated, living structure and whatever happens upstream will impact downstream - and vice versa Since then, the initial proposal to dredge 13\u00a0malos pasos, or \u2018difficult spots\u2019 on key passages of each of the four rivers, has raised a series of questions. Engineers claim these are not fully addressed in the Amazon Waterway\u2019s \u201cfar too general\u201d EIA. \u201cIf you are going to dredge, which is removing sediments, you should at least study how much sediment is moving along the bottom of the river,\u201d says Jorge Abad, an engineer who specialises in ecohydraulics. \u201cNo one has done this.\u201d Abad says dredging from the streambed requires modelling to determine its effectiveness and possible side-effects. \u201cIf we are signing for 20 years we should see more quantitative predictions of what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 and that\u2019s not coming from the company,\u201d he told Di\u00e1logo Chino. \u201cThe river is an integrated, living structure and whatever happens upstream will impact downstream and vice versa. They don\u2019t seem to understand this,\u201d says Abad, who has been studying of the Amazon river system for a decade. The involvement of a Chinese firm in the project is significant, according to Rosario Santa Gadea, director of the Centre for China and Asia Pacific Studies at Lima\u2019s Pacific University. \u201cChina is interested in investing in infrastructure abroad and opportunities in Peru are big,\u201d she says, adding the waterway project \u201ccould be beneficial for increasing connectivity between China and Peru in terms of international trade\u201d. In April, Peru formally endorsed China's major overseas connectivity project the Belt and Road Initiative.     The initial idea was to connect Peru\u2019s northern seaport of Paita to the Amazon region, Santa Gadea explained. Iquitos, the regional capital of Loreto, is the world\u2019s largest city that cannot be reached by road. The Amazon state is larger in size than Peru\u2019s neighbouring country Ecuador. The fish will flee and there won\u2019t be food for the children \u201cThere is the need to produce connectivity with Brazil in the Amazon part of our country,\u201d she added. But even Chinese observers have said the environmental cost might be too high. Zhang Jingjing, of the Transnational Environmental Accountability Project, told Di\u00e1logo Chino the \u201cindigenous people have deep concerns about any project which would affect their way of life.\u201d \u201cChina should comply with international norms to make sure China\u2019s international investment is green and clean,\u201d she added. Sinohydro is a Chinese state-owned firm and the world\u2019s largest\u00a0hydropower construction company. It has a chequered record on environmental standards and human rights. The firm has been involved in controversial hydropower projects around the world from the Kamchay-Cambodia dam in Asia, the\u00a0Kajbar-Sudan Dam\u00a0in Africa, and in South America, the Coca Coda Sinclair Dam in Ecuador, which was part of a\u00a0national scandal over its poor construction and alleged corruption. The EIA for the Amazon Waterway project has been drafted and re-drafted since the beginning of 2018 after initial rejections by Peru\u2019s environmental certification service SENACE for not including citizen participation workshops or consulting indigenous organisations. In May, SENACE accepted the EIA for evaluation, incorporating two indigenous federations (ORAU and CORPI) as interested third parties. At the same time, AIDESEP, the umbrella federation for native Amazonians, filed a compliance appeal with Lima\u2019s superior court to force Peru\u2019s transport and communications ministry to implement the project\u2019s prior consultation agreements, which it says were not carried out properly. Indigenous communities worry that dredging will impact piscine populations, along with other plans to remove tree trunks stuck in the river, known as\u00a0quirumas, which are havens for fish reproduction. \u00a0Dredging could also disrupt fish migration, impacting food security for the whole rainforest region, according to a report by the\u00a0Wildlife Conservation Society\u00a0in Peru. However, Peru\u2019s Transport and Communications ministry said in a series of\u00a0public meetings in the region\u00a0last month that it would implement a plan so that fish migration would not be affected. It would be ecologically and economically disastrous Prior to that, Loreto\u2019s main indigenous federation ORPIO, along with CORPI, ORAU and AIDESEP made a public announcement in May demanding that the project be declared non-viable. \u201cWe\u2019ll be affected because the [dredging] will mean the river banks get washed away and our [riverside] communities will start disappearing,\u201d said Zoila Merino, an indigenous Bora leader with ORPIO. \u201cThe fish will flee and there won\u2019t be food for the children. We\u2019ve been the owners of the forest for a long time. It\u2019s our market. For us, the water is health, life and food, it\u2019s everything. This connection won\u2019t benefit us,\u201d Merino added. Last month, Peru\u2019s national parks service\u00a0SERNANP\u00a0said the project\u2019s EIA would impact two endangered mammal species, the Amazon River Dolphin and the Giant River Otter. Flagging up\u00a031 observations on the impact study,\u00a0SERNANP highlighted particular concerns about three dredging points near the buffer zone of the Pacaya Samiria national reserve, Peru\u2019s largest,\u00a0and another in the Cordillera Azul national park\u2019s buffer zone. \u201cIt would be ecologically and economically disastrous,\u201d Richard Bodmer, president of NGO\u00a0FundAmazonia, told Di\u00e1logo Chino. \u201cOne third of Loreto is flooded forest which is a fish reproduction site and that\u2019s all going to be impacted by that kind of intensive dredging,\u201d Bodmer said, adding that dredging underwater mounds would cause the water to flow faster, meaning more droughts. A proposed new levy on transport is also unpopular. The local river shipping union rejects a fee that Cohidro would introduce for passage on the rivers. If the project goes ahead, any medium-to-large vessel would pay the concessionaire US$1.69, plus VAT of 18%, per unit of gross tonnage. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than a toll booth, which will make shipping 30% more expensive as well as the average family basket for food,\u201d said Carmen Nu\u00f1ez, general manager of Loreto\u2019s river shipping freight association, speaking to Di\u00e1logo Chino from Lima ahead of planned protests. \u201cI want the world to know that they have \u2018concessioned off\u2019 our Amazon, because the Amazon doesn\u2019t just belong to this government and to Peru, it belongs to the world. That\u2019s why we must conserve it, not send in dredgers.\u201d Peru\u2019s transport and communications ministry did not respond to requests for comment. \n            You can republish our articles for free under the Creative Commons licence.\n           \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Impacts and innovations in a key sector for China and Latin America  Mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to cleaner economies   Natural resources and responsible extraction   Bridging Latin America's infrastructure gap sustainably   The drivers, actors and institutions behind the billions  A chinadialogue partner site.\nFind out more\n Dialogo Chino uses cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

            "text": " \n\tTo mark International Women\u2019s Day (March 8), the Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange (DGCX) joined dozens of exchange houses around the globe to celebrate the 7th annual \u2018Ring the Bell for Gender Equality\u2019 ceremony.\n\n\tThe 2021 theme is \u201cWomen in leadership, achieving an equal future in a COVID- 19 world\u201d.\n\n\tThe initiative is a partnership between the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative, UN Women, UN Global Compact, Women in ETFs and International Finance Corporation and highlights the significant role of the private sector in advancing and empowering women in the workplace, marketplace and wider community.\n\n\tLes Male, CEO of DGCX, said: \u201cEquality and diversity are core pillars of our business at the DGCX and we strongly believe it is vital to continue empowering women in the marketplace and the wider national community. Various studies have exhibited the benefits that greater gender diversity brings to organizations, such as more effective decision-making, better service for customers and strong operational performance. The importance of women\u2019s leadership at the DGCX and indeed, across the UAE has also been starkly highlighted this year by Covid-19 pandemic and will continue to be a key part of the country\u2019s efforts to recover and come back better than ever before.\u201d\n\n\tDr Mouza Al Shehhi, Director, UN Women UAE Liaison Office for the GCC, said: \u201cWe are delighted to see UAE-based companies join \u2018Ring the Bell for Gender Equality\u2019 campaign, show their commitment to gender equality and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 5) and actively promote women\u2019s leadership in business. Women\u2019s leadership is, more than ever, a pressing priority as the world emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and they must be at the centre of global recovery and reconstruction efforts.\u201d\n\n\tMore than 86 exchanges around the world registered for the event, many of whom have made an internal commitment to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve gender equality and empower women at all levels. This includes a pledge to encourage listed companies to publicly report on relevant gender metrics while further promoting gender diversity among their own workforces.\n\n\tMaggie Mansour, Compliance Director of DGCX, added: \u201cWe are proud to join the WFE, UN organizations and exchange houses around the globe to recognize women for their contributions. As the region\u2019s leading exchange, it is our responsibility to help facilitate the global conversation to support women\u2019s empowerment and we are thrilled to be a part of such an important initiative while working towards diminishing the gender equality gaps.\u201d\n\n\tIn early 2020, DGCX announced that it became a signatory of the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), another initiative by the UN Women and UN Global Compact dedicated to promoting women\u2019s empowerment and advancing gender equality.\n\n\tAs part of its commitment to the UN WEPs, the DGCX has pledged to further foster an inclusive work environment by assessing and evaluating its gender equality performance. Through the WEP\u2019s Gender Gap Analysis Tools, the Exchange reviewed its policies and procedures, and reported significant progress by the end of the year, with working females increasing from 19% to 24% - as well as plans to increase this percentage even further this year. \u2013 TradeArabia News Service\n\n\n\t\u00a0  Tags:\n"

It is the first industrial-scale copper project to be developed in the Andean country.\n The project is owned and operated by Ecuacorriente, a subsidiary of state-owned Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan that comprises the Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group and the China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC). The Chinese consortium has a 30-year mining concession at Mirador.\n The Mirador project was previously undertaken by Corriente Resources which completed a feasibility study for a 25,000 tonnes per day (tpd) mining operation in 2005 and got the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the project approved in May 2006. A feasibility study for 30,000tpd operation was completed in 2008.\n The CRCC-Tongguan consortium acquired the Mirador project from Corriente Resources in May 2010 and commenced construction in 2012. The company invested approximately \u00a31.12bn ($1.4bn) on the project that commenced copper production in June 2019. The first shipment of 22,000t of copper from the mine was exported to China in January 2020.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The Mirador project is located in the in the C\u00f3ndor mountain range in the Ecuadorean Amazon.  The Mirador project is estimated to hold 3.2Mt of copper, 3.4Moz of gold and 27.1Moz of silver in proven and probable reserves. The Mirador open-pit mine commenced production in June 2019. The Mirador project is located in the in the C\u00f3ndor mountain range in the Ecuadorean Amazon.  The Mirador project is estimated to hold 3.2Mt of copper, 3.4Moz of gold and 27.1Moz of silver in proven and probable reserves. The Mirador open-pit mine commenced production in June 2019. The Mirador project is located in the in the C\u00f3ndor mountain range in the Ecuadorean Amazon.  Although Ecuacorriente planned to ramp up the copper production capacity at Mirador to 94,000 tonnes per year, it had to scale back the operations to a minimum due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n The Mirador copper-gold project is located in the El Pangui Canton, in the Zamora-Chinchipe Province of Ecuador, near the Peruvian border, approximately 340km to the south of Quito and approximately 70km east-southeast of the city of Cuenca.\n The mine covers approximately 2,995ha in the C\u00f3ndor mountain range in the Ecuadorean Amazon.\n Matador is a porphyry copper-gold-silver deposit with mineralisation hosted by the Late Jurassic granite and porphyries of the Zamora Batholith. The mineralisation at the Mirador deposit is found to be disseminated and fine-fracture controlled chalcopyrite with supergene chalcocite increasing copper graded inside an enrichment blanket of varying thickness.\n The Mirador open-pit mine is estimated to contain 3.2 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 3.4 million ounces (Moz) of gold, and 27.1Moz of silver in proven and probable reserves.\n Mirador is a conventional open-pit mine involving a drill, blast, load, and haul operations.\n The run-of-the-mine (ROM) ore is trucked to the nearby processing plant where it passes through a gyratory crusher, two-stage grinding in a semi-autogenous (SAG) mill and a ball mill, before entering the flotation circuit for the production of concentrate.\n The obtained concentrate undergoes dewatering, thickening, and filtration, and the final concentrates containing 29.5% copper, 4.9 g/t gold and 58 g/t silver are transported to the port of Guayaquil for shipment to copper refining plants in China.\n The current milling capacity of the processing plant is 30,000tpd which is planned to be increased to 60,000tpd eventually.\n The water requirement for the processing plant is sourced from the Rio Wawayme. \u00a0\u00a0\n AMEC and SNC-Lavalin were engaged in preparing the feasibility study reports for the project in 2005 and 2007.\n Knight Piesold and Merit Consultants International provided design services for the tailing facility of the project.\n Moose Mountain Technical Services (MMTS) provided mine plan, production schedule, mine operating costs and mine capital costs for the Mirador copper-gold project.\n                                    \nMiningSilverMining Equipment\n \nMining\n \nMining\n \nPowerMiningOil & Gas\n View More Get the latest energy news delivered to your inbox.

EXCLUSIVE: Lady Colin Campbell isn\u2019t surprised Buckingham Palace announced it was launching an investigation after a newspaper reported that a former aide had made a bullying allegation against Meghan Markle. On March 2, The Times London alleged that the 39-year-old drove out two personal assistants and left staff feeling \"humiliated.\" Markle\u2019s team strongly refuted the allegations.\u00a0 Then on March 3, Buckingham Palace said it was \"clearly very concerned\" about the allegations, and that the palace human resources team \"will look into the circumstances outlined in the article\" and would seek to speak to current and former staff. The allegations came days before the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s televised interview with Oprah Winfrey aired on Sunday. They were also made public less than two weeks after the palace announced that the couple\u2019s split from official duties would be final. PRINCE HARRY DISCUSSES PRINCE WILLIAM RELATIONSHIP STATUS DURING OPRAH WINFREY INTERVIEW \n      Just days before Meghan Markle's interview with Oprah Winfrey aired, palace aides accused the Duchess of Sussex of bullying during her time as a working royal. The 39-year-old's team strongly refuted the claims and said the expecting mother is 'saddened' by the allegations.\n      (Getty) \"The staff went to Prince William and said, \u2018This situation is untenable,\u2019\" the British aristocrat claimed to Fox News. \"\u2018We need justice to prevail. He said, \u2018We will follow the correct procedure.\u2019\" \"When it became apparent that Meghan\u2019s narrative was most likely going to be that she was mistreated by the palace aides, at that point, several of the staff demanded that the complaints that they had made some two years ago be reactivated,\" she continued. \"Those who said they were bullied wanted their case to be acted upon because they were worried that Meghan\u2019s complaints about them would jeopardize their future professional prospects. While some of them had already left the palace, they were still very much concerned about how Meghan\u2019s complaints would impact their futures. It was Prince William who said, \u2018Proceed.'\" Before the bombshell book \"Finding Freedom\" written by royal reporters Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand was released in summer 2020, Campbell published \"Meghan and Harry: The Real Story.\" Her book\u00a0aimed\u00a0to provide a \"behind-the-scenes authoritative account\" on Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s whirlwind romance, high-profile marriage as well as their decision to step back as senior members of the British royal family. PRINCE WILLIAM \u2018WAS VERY UNHAPPY\u2019 MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY 'USED PRINCESS DIANA'S IMAGERY,' SOURCE ALLEGES \n      British aristocrat Lady Colin Campbell has recently written a book titled \"Meghan and Harry: The Real Story\" about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n      (Photo by David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images)) Campbell, who previously published a book on Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, said she spoke to royals, past and present courtiers, fellow aristocrats, as well as mutual well-connected friends for her latest release. \"The palace aides are bringing up these complaints now because they suspected Meghan was not going to speak kindly about them in the interview,\" the 71-year-old shared. \"They wanted the opportunity to defend themselves. They wanted justice to prevail.\" \"And this is not a smear campaign that the palace somehow cooked up in the last few days because it started two years ago,\" she alleged. \"None of this is new. Meghan keeps on saying she has a voice and she wants to be heard. Well, these courtiers also have a voice and they want to be heard, too. Her accusations could potentially make them lose their jobs.\" In a statement, the palace said: \"The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace.\" PRINCE WILLIAM IS \u2018SAD AND SHOCKED\u2019 BY PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S RESPONSE TO QUEEN ELIZABETH: REPORT \n      Royal insiders have long claimed Prince William (right) told his younger brother Prince Harry (left) that he was allegedly concerned about his relationship with Meghan Markle (center), a former Hollywood actress.\n      (Getty) A rep for Willliam, 38, did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. According to The Times, the complaint was first made in October 2018, by Jason Knauf, the couple\u2019s former communication\u2019s secretary. The outlet reported that Knauf submitted the complaint in an effort to protect staffers who alleged they were being bullied by Markle. Some claimed they were reduced to tears. One royal aide allegedly told a colleague: \"I can\u2019t stop shaking.\" Knauf allegedly sent an email to Simon Case, who served as William\u2019s private secretary at the time. The email was then forwarded to Samantha Carruthers, head of human resources. In the email, Knauf claimed Carruthers \"agreed with me on all counts that the situation was very serious,\" adding, \"I remain concerned that nothing will be done.\" Knauf now works for William who is second in line to the throne. MEGHAN MARKLE \u2018IS SADDENED\u2019 BY ALLEGATION OF BULLYING PALACE STAFF: CLAIMS ARE AN \u2018ATTACK ON HER CHARACTER\u2019 \n      Prince William (seen here with his wife Kate Middleton) is second in line to the British throne.\n      (Getty Images) \u00a0A spokesperson for the Duchess of Sussex told Fox News she was \"saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma.\" Campbell claimed that several senior members of the royal family are disappointed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s tell-all with Winfrey, 67. \"My understanding is that there is absolutely not one member of the royal family that is not incensed by what has happened,\" she alleged. \"Harry absolutely has no support. Every single member is bemused, suffering from disbelief that Harry can allow Meghan to mount an attack upon the family. Because she used the term \u2018The Firm,\u2019 which means the family. The Firm does not mean the palace. The palace is entirely different from The Firm, which represents the family itself.\" \"Some of [the palace aides] even went on to seek medical treatment for post-traumatic stress,\" Campbell also alleged. During the sit-down, Harry, 36, acknowledged he does not have a close relationship presently with his brother William. His relationship with their father\u00a0Prince Charles, 72, has also been impacted. BUCKINGHAM PALACE RESPONDS TO MEGHAN MARKLE BULLYING ALLEGATIONS REPORT: \u2018WE ARE CLEARLY VERY CONCERNED\u2019 \n      During the interview with Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry weighed in on his relationship with his father Prince Charles (pictured here). At one point, the Duke of Sussex said the Prince of Wales stopped picking up his calls.\n      (Getty Images) \"There is a lot to work through there,\" Harry said about his relationship with the Prince of Wales.\u00a0\"I feel really let down. He\u2019s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like. And Archie is his grandson. I will always love him, but there is a lot of hurt that has happened.\" When asked about the Duke of Cambridge, Harry told the media mogul\u00a0about his brother:\u00a0 \"You know, as I've said before, I love William to bits. He's my brother. We've been through hell together. I mean, we have a shared experience. But, you know, we're on different paths. The relationship is space, at the moment. And, you know, time heals all things, hopefully.\" Markle married Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s grandson at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son Archie was born a year later. On Valentine\u2019s Day, the couple confirmed to Fox News that they are expecting their second child. MEGHAN MARKLE SAYS ROYAL FAMILY 'PERPETUATING FALSEHOODS ABOUT' PRINCE HARRY, HERSELF \n      Meghan Markle is expecting her second child, a girl.\n      (Photo by Getty) Markle and Harry stepped away from full-time royal life in March 2020, unhappy at media scrutiny and the strictures of their roles. They cited what they described as the intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media toward the duchess, who is African American. It was agreed the situation would be reviewed after a year. On Feb. 19, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the couple will not be returning to royal duties and Harry will give up his honorary military titles \u2014 a decision that makes formal, and final, the couple\u2019s split from the royal family. The pair verified \"they will not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. \" A spokesperson for the couple hit back at suggestions that Markle and Harry were not devoted to duty. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \n      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex currently reside in California with their son Archie.\n      (Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images) \"As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the U.K. and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organizations they have represented regardless of official role,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Both the governments signed an agreement, which draws Chinas promise to invest US$ 11 million for the development of houses through Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s affordable housing project. For the formation of a multimedia centre at the University of the West Indies Five Islands Campus a supplementary US$250,000 has been allotted. PM Gatson Browne, said the investment in housing on the island by China stimulates attempts to accomplish their goal of more climate-resilient homes for the people of Antigua and Barbuda. \u00a0 \u201cNormally, governments don\u2019t give money for that type of purpose. The fact that the People\u2019s Republic of China has carved out an opportunity for us to provide our people with affordable, free homes, it is really to their credit that they have created that type of flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThe grants are meant to aid in the islands development,\u201d said Chinese Ambassador to Antigua and Barbuda, Sun Ang. \u201cThe multimedia centre is a welcome addition to the resources available to students and educators and will assure that it is widely regarded as an institution of superiority,\u201d said Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of the West Indies, Five Islands Campus Professor Stafford Griffith. For the initiation of the 2020-2021 academic year the multimedia centre should be built in time.  Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.  \n\n"

Members of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), on Sunday, razed a Fulani settlement at Kajola, in Ibarapa area of Oyo State, in an attempt to arrest an elderly blind man, called Wakili Fulani, who they alleged to be a kidnap gang leader. In the process, Daily Trust gathered, a woman, suspected to be Wakilin Fulani\u2019s wife, was killed in the inferno. The police later confirmed the attack and the murder of the woman. Chairman of the Oyo State chapter of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji Abubakar Jijji, who confirmed the attack to Daily Trust, said the action was a setback to the association\u2019s search for peace and harmony. The Oyo State Police Command, in a statement by its spokesperson, CSP Fadeyi Olugbenga, said at around 9 am on Sunday, it was alerted that some unidentified persons, who were later found to be members of the OPC, had invaded Kajola community. \u201cThe invasion was reportedly aimed at arresting one Wakili, a Fulani by tribe, who is alleged to be the sponsor and mastermind of various criminal attacks against the people/farmers of Yoruba origin in the community. \u201cThe State Commissioner of Police has quickly moved into action and preliminary findings revealed that some OPC members went to Kajola community in Ibarapa North Local government Area of Oyo State.\u201d The police confirmed that the house of the wakili was set ablaze, while an unidentified female was burnt in the fire. The wakili, who the police said is about 75-years-old and blind, and two other persons were apprehended by the OPC gang. Arrests blind Fulani leader \u201cThe three of them are presently in the custody of the Police. The Commissioner of Police has directed that Wakili (due to his frail appearance and state of health), be moved to the Hospital, while others are being interrogated. Others being interrogated are the OPC members, involved in arson and murder.\u201d The chairman of Miyetti Allah in Oyo state, described the attack as unjust and unfortunate, saying his association has been working closely with the state government on ways to find a lasting solution to insecurity bedevilling the state. He bemoaned what he described as incessant attacks by members of the OPC and Amotekun on members of the Fulani ethnic groups and their settlements. \u201cThey recently went to Bode Musa market and shot our people that went to transact their legal businesses.\u00a0 They killed our people over a very minor altercation. \u201cJust two days ago, they killed two old men, and five other persons sustained gunshots. We have their pictures and all pieces of evidence that the authorities may require. In Agware, Amotekun went there and killed people. They went to seize machetes from the Fulani which they resisted and they killed them. \u201cThey should understand that herdsmen cannot go without a knife and machetes because they use it to slaughter their sick animals.\u201d Jijji said MACBAN will hand over anybody suspected to have committed an offence to security operatives for investigation. Surprisingly, they don\u2019t differentiate between criminals and innocent citizens. They visit markets and shot indiscriminately at people who come to transact businesses.\u201d Jijji said the attack on Kajola came as Fulani leaders were working with security and community leaders to investigate allegations labelled against the Wakili. \u201cWe advised security operatives to form a committee that will investigate his case and come up with a fair report of whether he committed the said offence they accused of or not.\u201d"

Both parties will meet again Tuesday. \n\t\u201cWhile we remain hopeful that a strike can be avoided, Manitoba Hydro has developed and implemented contingency plans to help ensure emergency and essential services, as well as public safety, are maintained throughout any labour disruption,\u201d the spokesperson said.

Similar polling numbers show most other Americans agree with them. Are these real disputes or confusion over what the other side thinks? Research by the think tank Populace suggests it\u2019s confusion. This creates collective illusions, or gaps between an individual\u2019s personal opinions and that same individual\u2019s perception of what others think. It leads to Donald TrumpDonald TrumpMcCabe wins back full FBI pension after being fired under Trump Biden's Supreme Court reform study panel notes 'considerable' risks to court expansion Bennie Thompson not ruling out subpoenaing Trump MORE\u2019s and Joe BidenJoe BidenMcAuliffe holds slim lead over Youngkin in Fox News poll Biden signs bill to raise debt ceiling On The Money \u2014 Progressives play hard ball on Biden budget plan MORE\u2019s voters misjudging each other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Populace report on The American Aspiration Index interviewed 2,010 Americans from Jan 21-28, the first week of the Biden administration. It asked for views on the country\u2019s future and included small group talks with voters from both sides. The main finding was that division comes from intense disagreement on a small number of issues, not disputes on many issues.\u00a0 Trump and Biden voters agree on a greater number of high-level goals. Out of each group\u2019s top 15 of 55 personally-held priorities for the country, Trump and Biden voters hold nine in common. The top personal priority for both groups is an overwhelming commitment to the belief that \u201cPeople have individual rights.\u201d And that\u2019s the top priority they believe \u201cmost people\u201d want to protect for future generations. Both groups express a bipartisan sense of urgency on five policy goals: access to quality health care; safety in communities and neighborhoods; criminal justice reforms; help for the middle class; and modernized infrastructure. At least 50 percent of both groups say they\u2019d be personally \u201cupset\u201d if America didn\u2019t make significant progress on these issues over the next few years. Remarkably, this agreement holds across almost all races, genders, education levels and generations.\u00a0 In its research, Populace used a choice-based conjoint (CBC) survey to distinguish between an individual\u2019s personal opinion and the person\u2019s perceived opinion of what society thinks. It also simulates real-world tradeoffs for respondents, rather than directly asking what goals they hold. With CBC, a typical margin of error doesn\u2019t apply. Root likelihood is used, with certainty scores of 85.3 percent for personal responses and 84.5 percent for perceived societal responses.\u00a0 No issue shows more partisan disagreement than immigration. For Trump voters, \u201cseverely restricts immigration\u201d was third out of 55 most important personally-held national aspirations, versus 46th for Biden voters. Trump voters\u2019 personal views also stressed that the country would \u201c[have] secure national borders.\u201d It was second in the top five personally-held national aspirations for them, versus 31st for Biden voters. Two other differences stand out. Biden voters place a much higher personal priority on the importance of a \u201cquality education\u201d to the country\u2019s future than do Trump voters, ranking it ninth versus 26th out of 55. The voter groups also have different attitudes on what should be expected of work, though both place it in the top 15 personal aspirations. Biden voters prioritize jobs and careers as a way to have material security (10th, versus 29th out of 55). Trump voters emphasize the intangible \u2014 i.e., \u201cjobs they enjoy\u201d (12th, versus 21st out of 55).\u00a0 Finally, in combining some of the top 15 of 55 goals for the country\u2019s future, both groups want equal treatment and opportunity, but not necessarily equal outcomes. The values ranked toward the top include that people \u201chave individual rights\u201d (first); \u201care treated equally, regardless of background, in all aspects of society\u201d (sixth); \u201care able to go as far in life as their abilities and aspirations will take them\u201d (12th); and \u201ctreat one another with respect\u201d (14th). On the other hand, an America that \u201chas very little income inequality\u201d was 41st of 55.\u00a0 The bottom line: Biden and Trump voters hold collective illusions about each other. What\u2019s mistaken for vast partisan, political disagreement instead is intense but narrow differences on a limited number of issues. There is a bipartisan center with a sense of urgency that expects progress to be made on at least five issues. And this should occur in a context that values equal treatment and opportunity, rather than equal results. Bruno V. Manno is senior adviser to the Walton Family Foundation\u2019s K-12 Program.

The company expects to produce an additional 10 million mt/year at its existing Marcona mine. Currently, Shougang produces 11 million mt of iron ore per year. The Peruvian iron ore producer should complete the expansion of the Marcona mine by H2 2018, when it should reach over 20 million mt/year in capacity. Earlier this year, in June, Shougang Hierro Peru obtained $500 million in financing from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to fund the second phase of its proposed Marcona mine expansion project. The $500 million in financing from ICBC will be combined with another loan of $200 million from DBS Bank, Hong Kong branch, to expand the Marcona mine.

            "text": " Some Mashpee Wampanoag tribal citizens are traveling from other states to receive their COVID-19 vaccines from the tribe. Rob Maxim, of Washington, D.C., plans to get his first dose of the vaccine through the tribal health office on Tuesday, along with his fiance, who has asthma. \u201cFor us to know that both of us are vaccinated is going to be a huge thing,\u201d he said. They probably couldn\u2019t get vaccinated for several months if they stayed in Washington, he said. He said the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe\u2019s ability to offer the vaccine to its citizens and other members of their households is a testament to the tribe\u2019s ability to work with the federal government \u2014 and to the government\u2019s interest in making sure Native Americans get vaccinated. And he feels lucky that the tribe has allocated its doses quickly, with a simplified phasing system, he said. \u201cThere are probably lessons that other government entities could learn from tribes, and from indigenous people,\u201d because a number of tribes have done similar things, he said. Tribal health offices in the eastern United States have received about 36,000 doses total, according to the Indian Health Service. That\u2019s in an area that runs from Maine to Texas. Maxim said the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe has been fortunate to have relatively fewer cases of COVID-19 than some tribes in the West. \u201cBut there is a long history of diseases \u2014 and COVID is another example of that \u2014 disproportionately affecting Native communities,\u201d he said. The couple plans to stay with Maxim\u2019s parents, in Sandwich, until they can get their second dose."

A murder investigation continues today in Troon Avenue in Ardler after a man was charged over the disappearance of a woman and her daughter. Bennylyn Burke, 25, and her two-year-old daughter Jellica were reported missing from South Gloucestershire at the start of the month. After a major police investigation on Friday in Troon Avenue, a 50-year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with the deaths of Bennylyn and Jellica as inquiries are continuing to establish their whereabouts. Officers remain stationed at the detached, five-bedroom house on Troon Avenue, both outside and inside the property. A large white tent now covers a skip in the driveway, which was the centre of much forensic activity on Saturday. Other than the police vehicles and cordons blocking every entrance to Troon Avenue during the investigation, the scene is currently much quieter than it has been in recent days. One neighbour said: \u201cThe police were here all night and there was quite a bit of activity later on. \u201cI could see around five forensic officers going into the house. \u201cAfterwards a large white tent was put up around the skip. \u201cPolice have also continued to do door to door inquires and have been speaking to neighbours. \u201cThis is a really disturbing situation and my thoughts are with the missing woman\u2019s family.\u201d Another Ardler resident said: \u201cI\u2019ve passed the road end a few times over the past few days and I am concerned that there is still a large police presence here. \u201cEveryone is talking about it and everyone just wants it to have a happy ending but we are beginning to obviously fear the worst.\u201d The man who was charged is due to appear in court on Monday. \u00a9 DC Thomson Co Ltd 2021.

Kendal 11\u00b0c Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, with his daughter Gabriella during a protest outside the Iranian Embassy in London Hopes have been raised that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s ordeal is reaching the \u201cendgame\u201d as the British-Iranian woman was released from house arrest after serving a five-year sentence in Iran. A former top civil servant at the Foreign Office welcomed \u201cgood\u201d progress in her case, as her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said he hopes it may be reaching the final stages but cautioned \u201cwe might have many more months to go\u201d. The 42-year-old mother, who was detained in 2016 as Tehran made widely refuted spying allegations, finished the latter part of her sentence under house arrest due to Covid-19 and had her ankle tag removed on Sunday. But her future remains uncertain as she must appear before an Iranian court in a week\u2019s time to face new charges. Former Foreign Office permanent secretary Lord McDonald told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe\u2019re in the endgame, the Iranian system is behaving in a typical way. \u201cNazanin has completed her sentence, something good yesterday happened with the removal of the ankle tag but the final moves have still to take place \u2013 this case has not yet ended.\u201d Mr Ratcliffe, who was preparing to protest outside Iran\u2019s London embassy with their six-year-old daughter on Monday, expressed cautious optimism over the prospects of his wife\u2019s return to the UK after speaking last week with Dominic Raab. \u201cI spoke last week to the Foreign Secretary who said, listen, I can\u2019t promise you it\u2019s going to be this weekend but it feels like we\u2019re close,\u201d said Mr Ratcliffe, who has long campaigned for her freedom. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to other former hostages and they say yes at the end it gets quite bumpy and this, to them, feels like the endgame. So fingers crossed it is but also we might have many more months to go.\u201d Many have linked a long-standing debt running into hundreds of millions of pounds as central to the case, which has been dubbed \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d by former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. The UK is thought to owe Iran as much as \u00a3400 million over the non-delivery of tanks in 1979, with the shipment stopped because of the Islamic revolution. Lord McDonald insisted it was a \u201cseparate case\u201d but said work is under way to pay back what he said is accepted is owed to Tehran. \u201cWe acknowledge it is Iranian money and does have to go back to Tehran, problems in that case cannot complicate Nazanin\u2019s release from Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cA huge amount of imagination has gone into that. One of the key complications is that Iran is subject to very comprehensive sanctions so how this money is repaid is a part of the story. But we are dealing with that.\u201d Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker who was employed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has strongly denied the widely refuted allegations that she was plotting to overthrow the Islamic Republic\u2019s government. The mother, of north London, was arrested at Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini Airport while taking their daughter Gabriella to see her parents in April 2016. The fresh charges she is expected to face were unclear, but the Guardian reported that they include alleged involvement in propaganda activity against Iran, including attending a 2009 demonstration outside its embassy in London, and speaking to BBC Persian. Mr Ratcliffe, Gabriella and his wife\u2019s brother Mohamed will demonstrate outside the Iranian embassy in Knightsbridge from around midday on Monday. They will deliver a 60,000-signature Amnesty International petition to the embassy calling for his wife\u2019s immediate release. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Iran to release her \u201cpermanently\u201d, adding her \u201ccontinued confinement remains totally unacceptable\u201d. The UK has been locked in a high-profile diplomatic tussle over her detention, during which she suffered time in solitary confinement and took part in hunger strikes. The Government has afforded her diplomatic protection, arguing she is innocent and that her treatment by Iran failed to meet obligations under international law.

            "text": " Maputo \u2014 The Mozambican Minister of Health, Armindo Tiago, has become the first health professional to be vaccinated against the Covid-19 respiratory pandemic, marking the start of a nationwide roll-out, under which the country's 65,000 health professionals will receive two doses of the vaccine, donated by the Chinese government and produced by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm. The central ceremony was held on Monday at Maputo Central Hospital (HCM), the country's largest health unit. At the start of the roll-out, other citizens such as the director general of the hospital, Mouzinho Saide, a nurse, two elderly people and two grave-diggers were also vaccinated. Addressing the ceremony, Armindo Tiago said the roll out will move on in full compliance with the safety and efficacy patterns internationally recommended. \"This gesture may seem symbolic but it is of great importance for us, because through it we want to show the reliability of the vaccination drive, headed by the government, so that everyone, health workers and civil society at large, can trust the process,\" Tiago said. The vaccine, he said, will be administered through an intramuscular injection on the upper arm in two doses, with an interval of 21 days. The efficacy level is estimated to be 79.3 per cent against Covid-19, but 100 per cent against the most serious forms of the disease, which require hospitalisation. For the success of the programme, Tiago said several preparatory measures have taken place among them the passing of regulatory instruments; the provision of logistical conditions for keeping the vaccines in compliance with the recommendations of the manufacturer; the training of health staff; and Friday's launch of the National Vaccination Plan which includes communication and social mobilization components.

However, the minister pointed out that the vaccination of the health workers should not be allowed to interfere with normal service at the health units. The director general of the HCM, Mouzinho Saide, encouraged all other health workers to take the vaccine free from any form of hesitation, because it is safe and protects against the serious forms of the respiratory disease. \"We are the first health workers to be vaccinated and in this ceremony the Minister of Health has also been vaccinated to serve as an example,\" he said, adding that after taking the vaccine he did not feel any adverse reaction. On Monday, Mozambique received a further 485,000 doses of vaccine. 385,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been provided under the Covax initiative, sponsored by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to ensure that all low and middle income countries receive the vaccines they need. The Indian government donated 100,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India. Eventually, the Covax initiative is expected to provide Mozambique with over 12.3 million doses of vaccine, enough to vaccine ate over six million people.

            "text": " The Chinese-owned mining company Ecuagoldmining has notified the government of Ecuador its intention to begin an arbitration process if the two sides cannot negotiate a solution on the status of a major mining operation that has been halted for almost two years due to local protests and local judicial decisions. At first glance, this appears to be a standard investor-state dispute, particularly as protests against mining operations in developing states are quite common. Nevertheless, there are several factors at play that make this case worthy of greater analysis, including the size of the award that Ecuagoldmining is requesting, as well as Ecuador\u2019s complex situation in international arbitration nowadays after leaving the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and terminating most of its Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). \u00a0 The case: Ecuagoldmining v Ecuador The Chinese companies Junefield Mineral Resources Limited and Hunan Gold Group created Ecuagoldmining South America S.A. to exploit and mine gold and silver of the Rio Blanco project in Ecuador. The area of the project covers 4,979 hectares and the estimated reserves are 605 thousand ounces of gold and 4.3 million ounces of silver. Mining operations commenced in 2016, but they were soon affected by protests carried out by environmental activists and the inhabitants of the Cuenca region. Protesters argued that they had not been consulted about the mine, and that this project would have catastrophic environmental consequences on their homeland as it would pollute their sources of water. Some of the protesters\u2019 tactics included\u00a0 blocking a road that leads out of the mine, and some mining equipment was also destroyed. In 2018, two major judicial decisions sided with the protesters. First, a local judge revoked the company\u2019s mining license because the local population was not consulted. This ruling was ratified by another court which \u201crecognized that the people of Molleturo had not been properly consulted.\u201d The Ecuadorian government and the company argue that Rio Blanco is a strategic mining project, necessary to improve the country\u2019s economy and local development. According to the Ecuadorian media, mining at Rio Blanco has been paralyzed since May 2018. \u00a0 The scope of the potential award In February, Ecuagoldmining opened a dispute against Ecuador over the halted project. We are now in the middle of a six-month period in which the two parties can negotiate an end to their dispute or initiate an arbitration procedure. The Chinese company has already invested around $20 million USD in the project and planned to invest another $69 million, the Ecuadorian media reports. According to NASDAQ, \u201cIf it does go to arbitration, the Ecuagoldmining will seek the full value of the gold that it expected to produce during the 11-year concession.\u201d This would amount to $469 million. \u00a0 Similar precedents  In order to properly understand this case, there are many precedents and legal issues to take into account. First of all, other arbitral tribunals have accepted the investor\u2019s loss of profits claims by taking into account the entire period of the license agreements signed with the state. One great example is P&ID v Nigeria, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, which invested $40 million in a project in the African nation. The company was subsequently awarded $6.6 billion via an arbitration decision for the loss of profit that P&ID expected to earn over 20 years, according to the period of agreement. In this case, the Nigerian government was found to have breached its obligation to construct pipelines and to supply natural gas to P&ID\u2019s production facility, under a Build and Operate Agreement. An accumulated 7% interest was added to the $6.6 billion award, rendering the total sum of $9.5 billion. This constitutes \u00a020% of Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves. \u00a0 The legal basis of the compensation The dispute of the PD&I v Nigeria case was subject to Nigerian law, which is a mixed legal system consisting of English law, common law, customary law, and Sharia (Islamic) law. Under common law, if the contract has been repudiated, the aggrieved party may also become entitled to an award for loss of profits. To put it simply: the measure of damages is the sum required to put party \u201cA\u201d in the position in which it would have been if party \u201cB\u201d had performed its obligation under the contract. Thus, the Tribunal held that: \u2018if the contract had been performed, P&ID would have received for 20 years an income from the sale of natural gas. The loss is therefore the value of the stream of net profit which P&ID would have made if the government had performed the contract according to its terms.\u2019 Although this dispute was governed under Nigerian law, a breach of a bilateral investment treaty may also lead to a similar remedy. In investment arbitration, the most common remedy is monetary compensation. Moreover, under the International State Responsibility Act, other available remedies for the reparation of a wrongful act consists of restitution in kind or specific performance such as interim measure or interim injunction and satisfaction. The possibility of compensation for lost profits has been recognized by the International Law Commission, specifically in the commentary to Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Article 36, which stipulates that \u2018The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\u2019 Case in point, an ICSID tribunal in Amco v Indonesia held that in case the state\u2019s illegal act destitutes the investor of income, damages will also consist of lost profits. Therefore, in principle, an investor\u2019s compensation will reflect gains it would have made and restore the situation that would have existed had the state\u2019s unlawful act not been committed. If found unlawful, measures such as cancelling and terminating the license agreements, may lead to investors claiming the compensation for the loss of profit for the same period as the period of the contract. This is what occurred in Nigeria, where the tribunal took into account the period of the agreement concluded with the state. Hence in a potential claim against Ecuador, the tribunal may award damages which could consist of 11 years lost profits. Therefore, when providing investors with licenses and certificates for the extraction of natural resources, such as mining in case of Ecuador, and supply and processing of natural gas in case of Nigeria, states must be aware of the consequences of terminating license agreements. Instead of concluding a long-term agreement, the state may consider concluding a contract for a shorter initial period with the possibility of extending the contract. Especially when the object of the contract concerns the environment and may trigger protests by the local population. \u00a0 Limited grounds for appeal It is worth noting that the awards concerning Investor-State disputes under ICSID Rules enjoy automatic enforcement and can only be annulled on limited grounds, while non-ICSID awards, i.e under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are capable of being challenged and refused recognition and enforcement under the grounds set out in Article V of the New York Convention, which applies to foreign arbitral awards in international commercial arbitration. Nevertheless, in the aforementioned P&ID v Nigeria case, under the dispute resolution clause, the applicable rules were the rules of the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the seat of the arbitration was London. Hence, the investor had initiated proceedings in the English courts and sought to enforce the arbitral award as a judgment or order of the English court pursuant to Section 66 of the arbitration Act of 1996. After the Commercial Court issued a decision in favor of the investor that allowed the enforcement of the arbitral award, the Nigerian government then turned to a London Court to appeal the enforcement decision of the arbitral award and requested a stay-of-enforcement during the appeal proceeding. However, this tactic is costly as well. Pursuant to the English Arbitration Act of 1996, Section 70 (7), the court may order the payment of security pending the appeal. Therefore, the Nigerian government had to make a payment of USD$ 200 million pending the appeal. In its appeal, the Nigerian government argued that the award is \u2018manifestly excessive\u2019. However, the grounds via which an arbitral award can be challenged, or appealed, under the aforementioned Arbitration Act are narrow and limited to challenging an award due to issues with \u201csubstantive jurisdiction\u201d of the arbitral tribunal under Section 67, serious irregularities causing substantial injustice under Section 68, which is subject to a high threshold, and finally appeal on a question of law under Section 69. Generally, the courts where the enforcement of arbitral awards will be sought will not give consideration and weight as to whether an award is manifestly \u201cexcessive\u201d and will only be bound by the options set forth in the relevant Arbitration Act. Usually, the grounds of refusal of recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards are similar to those stated in Article V of the New York Convention, but due to the word \u2018may\u2019 in the Article, the grounds may differ. In this regard, the relevant arbitration law of the country where the enforcement of an arbitral award will be sought plays an ultimate role. Should the Ecuagoldmining v Ecuador turn to an arbitration case, and if the verdict is subsequently challenged, it will be important to monitor where the legal proceedings will take place, as the seat of arbitration may heavily influence whether one party or the other emerges victorious. \u00a0 Can Ecuador pay USD469 million? It is necessary to stress the amount that Ecuagodmining could potentially receive if the case goes to arbitration: $469 million USD. This is no pocket change, particularly as Ecuador is suffering the devastating effects of COVID-19. At time of writing, the government has put the state-run airline company Tame in liquidation, another casualty of the pandemic on the commercial aviation industry. In other words, Quito cannot afford to pay USD469 million, not to mention legal fees on an arbitration trial. While it is true that the events that halted Ecuagoldmining\u2019s operations preceded the pandemic, the current global situation is an event of force majeure, which could postpone certain legal processes. \u00a0 Ecuador\u2019s previous stance re BITs and global arbitration Apart from Ecuador\u2019s complicated financial situation, the South American country is also in an awkward situation when it comes to global arbitration. During the administration of President Rafael Correa (2007-2017), an outspoken critic of Washington, Ecuador was one of three South American countries that withdrew from ICSID in the first decade of the new century \u2013 the other two were Bolivia and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Moreover, Quito also terminated 16 of its bilateral investment treaties (BITs) in 2017, including ones with the capital exporting countries like Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States and even with its neighboring countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela. Interestingly, Quito also terminated its BIT with the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u00a0 signed in 1994. The Correa administration\u2019s dislike of BITs and arbitration was arguably caused by the massive financial losses the country suffered in previous investment arbitration disputes. Case in point, Quito lost a memorable case against the US oil company Occidental Petroleum Corp, and was ordered to pay a compensation of $2.3 billion USD, having incurred additional legal expenses worth $94 million (the award was later reduced to under a billion dollars). Following this defeat, a national investment treaties audit commission was established (CAITISA) which, unsurprisingly, recommended to terminate all of Ecuador\u2019s BITs. \u00a0 The sunset clause in the Ecuador \u2013 China BIT When the negotiation period between Ecuagoldmining and Ecuador was announced, Deputy Mining Minister Enrique Gallegos-Anda stated that \u201cthe six-month process is the first step in a potential arbitration as laid out in an investment treaty between Ecuador and China. This statement deserves a little more analysis. As we mentioned in the previous section, Ecuador has unilaterally terminated its BIT with China. However, this does not prevent Ecuagoldmining from filing a claim against Ecuador by virtue of the BIT\u2019s Art.13.4, which stipulates that the treaty will continue to be effective for a period of 10 years from the date of the termination in respect of investments made before that date. Such a provision is called a sunset clause and it is applied in case of a unilateral termination of a treaty. The clause\u2019s objective is to provide for a survival period which ensures that the investor\u2019s rights will be protected despite the termination of the treaty. Since Ecuagoldmining began its operations in 2016, before the BITs termination took place in 2017, the Chinese consortium is able to file the arbitration claim pursuant to the sunset clause. \u00a0 Change of leadership, change of attitude Since coming to power, President Lenin Moreno (2017-present) has maintained a positive disposition towards US and European governments and financial institutions. In other words, the current presidential administration has essentially carried out a 180 degree turn in its foreign policy, and this will affect the country\u2019s relations with foreign investors and international arbitration institutions. The Ecuadorian daily El Comercio reported in February that the Moreno administration is negotiating new BITs to replace the cancelled ones, but the process has been paralyzed for the past three years (since Moreno came to power) due to some decrees passed by the country\u2019s Constitutional Court. The report explained that \u201cduring the visit to China by the first president, Len\u00edn Moreno, at the end of 2018, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the intention of resuming negotiations, leading to a possible new investment treaty.\u201d However, a new BIT has yet to be signed. The article goes on to explain that: \u201cIn order to partially solve the vacuum generated by the lack of BIT, the government included in the Law for the Productive Promotion and Attraction of Investments, in force since August 2018, an article that allows investment contracts that exceed the $10 million, the State agrees national or international arbitration.\u201d It is unclear when these legal obstacles will be surmounted so that the country can sign new BITs, but at the very least, it is important to stress that the current administration is focused on attracting investors and promoting trade. In April, the congress ratified a trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association. Similarly, there is no information about whether the current administration will attempt to rejoin ICSID. \u00a0 Conclusions Ecuagoldmining v Ecuador is an example of why states must be aware that if they conclude long-term contracts, a breach of them could lead to massive financial penalties. After all, the period of the agreement influences the amount of the compensation, under the umbrella of loss of profit. This is demonstrated by PD&I v Nigeria, in which a $40 million investment turned into a $6.6 billion award plus interest rates. Similarly, Ecuagoldmining\u2019s estimated $20 million investment so far could turn into a $469 million award, should it emerge victorious in an arbitration proceeding. For a country that will economically suffer from COVID-19 for the foreseeable future, and a Moreno administration that just last year had to flee from Quito to Guayaquil to escape angry protests, this potential award would be devastatingly crippling. \u00a0 \u00a0 Wilder Alejandro Sanchez is an analyst who focuses on geopolitical, military, and cybersecurity issues.

            "text": " \n  \nMore than 480 team members at Transact, the leader in innovative payment solutions for a connected campus, celebrated International Women's Day today as the company reinforced its commitment to equality and inclusion. In a company-wide memorandum, CEO David Marr and VP of Human Resources Jill Clark called on team members to renew their commitment as One Transact.\n \n\"As One Transact, each of us plays a critical role in creating an environment where all team members can achieve their potential, without prejudice,\" said David Marr, CEO. \"Although today is a day we join the celebration of women's achievements and raise awareness about women's equality, doing our part to create and nurture an inclusive world is a priority for us every day.\"\n \nInternational Women's Day celebrations date back to 1911 and mark the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. Transact encouraged team members to participate in this year's conversation by wearing purple, green, and white, colors of the Day signifying justice, dignity, hope, and purity. In addition, Transact invited team members to join the \"Choose to Challenge\" conversation on social media and posted advice from senior women leaders around the organization.\n \nThe company's executive women shared with team members their reflections about the day, their inspirations, and their advice, including:\n \n\"When I think of Choose to Challenge, I think of challenging ourselves to support women around us,\" said Transact Vice President of Human Resources Jill Clark. \"I'm inspired by the women leaders in my network who are dynamic leaders in their organizations and find time for family and giving back in their community, as well. They are driven to make all they touch better.\"\n \n\"My advice to my former professional self? If an opportunity is available, and you think you're not ready, do it anyway,\" said Transact Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis Maria Aguirre. \"You'll learn more from the stretch than you imagine.\"\n \n\"We still need greater awareness of opportunities for young women in STEM fields,\" said Transact Vice President of Product Management Erica Bass \"Getting girls interested in technology at an early age is key. Young girls need to see - and believe - it is possible to succeed in this arena.\"\n \n\"There are many people who inspire me. My mom had a career in banking and also had the overwhelming majority of all the household responsibilities, but in her day, that was the price a woman often paid to have a career,\" said Transact Chief Marketing Officer Kelly Christiano. \"I am also inspired by people like actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who now refuses to sign on to a project unless his female costar is paid the same.\"\n \n\"My advice to my younger professional self would be to compromise less, respectfully vocalize opinions, and challenge those who present adversity,\" said Transact Chief of Staff Laura Newell-McLaughlin. \"I am inspired by many things, particularly the everyday acts of friends and colleagues who give their time to assist others.\"\n \n\"The #ChooseToChallenge theme for International Women's Day this year reminds me, 'If you don't challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can become,'\" said Senior Developer Sunitha Muthurajan. \"COVID-19 has had a big impact on women not only economically, but also broadly in all aspects of life from managing work, family, taking care of kids with no day care facilities, supporting them for their on-line classes, playing role of teachers, etc. Hoping that this year is going to be bit smoother, let's challenge ourselves to regain the purpose of our life and achieve the levels we truly deserve. From now on, let's challenge ourselves to march steadfastly to reach our goals. And most of all, let's challenge ourselves to be brave and express our thoughts.\"\n \n\"I'm really excited about the theme this year because it reminds us all that we are responsible for our own thoughts and actions,\" said Senior Product Owner Eithne O'Grady. \"It's important to remind ourselves that change can only be implemented by a culture of willingness to embrace challenges and make a difference.\"\n \n\"One of the ways men can do their part for women's equality in the workplace is to be a sponsor,\" said Transact Vice President Rachael Sepcic. \"A sponsor is different than a mentor. A sponsor has faith in your potential, is willing to take a bet on you, recognizes your abilities and contributions as an individual, actively advocates for your next position, encourages you to take risks, and always has your back. I've been blessed with amazing male sponsors in my career.\"\n \nFollow Transact on Twitter and LinkedIn and join the conversation.

More info Ms Le Pen, leader of the populist National Rally, is coming within reach of beating President Macron in next year\u2019s French election, a new poll suggests. The Harris survey, published today, predicts a replay of the final-round run-off between the pair in the 2017 election. The study suggests French voters could be moving towards backing what is considered a far-right candidate for the first time. If elected, Ms Le Pen would break the so-called \u201cglass ceiling\u201d of French politics for the first time with the country\u2019s electorate casting aside longstanding assumptions that they would never back an extreme contender in the ballot. If the May 2020 election were to be staged now, Ms Le Pen would have 47 percent of the vote, with Mr Macron on 53 percent, according to the poll. In their 2017 showdown, Mr Macron secured 66 percent of the vote, compared to Ms Le Pen\u2019s 34 percent. The latest poll has been met with glee by her National Rally colleagues, who believe they are edging closer to victory as support for their leader soars.       French MEP Helene Laporte said: \u201cA new poll puts Marine Le Pen neck and neck in the second round against Emmanuel Macron, with 47 percent voting intentions. \u201cVictory is at hand!\u201d Fellow MEP Dominique Bilde added: \u201cMarine Le Pen in the second round against Emmanuel Macron with 47 percent of voting intentions. \u201cVictory is approaching!\u201d    Analysts believe Ms Le Pen\u2019s move to the centre ground has helped her secure fresh support from the French electorate. The National Rally leader has adopted a much softer approach on controversial issues such as migration, and no longer is campaigning to leave the European Union. And even if she doesn\u2019t succeed in next year\u2019s presidential election, some experts believe she could push Mr Macron as close as 52-48 percent \u2013 the same margin as Britain\u2019s Brexit referendum. MUST READ:\u00a0EU tipped for catastrophic breakup as Brexit hits German exports to UK    BFMTV\u2019s political columnist Matthieu said: \u201cAnother thing that worries the Elysee is the new posture of Marine Le Pen. \u201cWe no longer wants to leave Europe, she wants to repay the debt, she is much softer on Islam and security than she was in the past. \u201cAnd then there was the debate between Gerald Darmanin and Marine Le Pen, where we had the impression that they were in agreement on certain element.

Join Riverfront Times Press Club. \n\nMarch 08, 2021\n\nNews\n        \n        \n          \u00bb Hartmann\n THEO WELLING The St. Louis County Board of Police Commissioners' bungling doesn't get enough attention. The best defense for beleaguered St. Louis County Police Chief Mary Barton is that she had nothing to do with hiring Police Chief Mary Barton. \nOn the job for slightly more than ten months, Barton\u2019s tenure can charitably be described as a no-good, dirty-rotten experience for all concerned. But it\u2019s the St. Louis County Board of Police Commissioners \u2014 not Barton \u2014 that owns the curious decision to miscast her in a role for which she\u2019s so obviously ill suited. \nLast spring, the board inexplicably passed over an obviously more qualified candidate in Lt. Col. Troy Doyle, widely viewed within the department (and on the outside) as the likely successor to retiring Chief Jon Belmar. Doyle is suing the county for race discrimination over having been snubbed for a white candidate with less rank and experience in Barton. \nMost of the fallout of the police board\u2019s curious move landed upon County Executive Sam Page, whose taped voice made the news \u2014 courtesy of Doyle\u2019s lawyer Jerry Dobson \u2014 proclaiming to Doyle \u201cthe police board will do what I tell it to do\u201d by hiring him. Page could only have wished that he might have dictated \u201cthe media will do what I tell it do\u201d in not airing the tape. Sadly for him, the tape aired. \nFor police board members the publicity wasn\u2019t such a bad break at the time, because it deflected attention from their own dubious actions. Now, however, some spotlight might return to the unacceptably reclusive board with the sudden resignation of its chairman, former Judge William Ray Price Jr., halfway through his three-year term. \nPrice was not only appointed by Page, but apparently has been offered a starring role in Doyle\u2019s lawsuit. Price and fellow Page appointee Michelle Schwerin, a local attorney, were put on the board in November 2019 after taking a meeting with Doyle \u2014 at Page\u2019s request \u2014 to pre-screen his candidacy for chief, the lawsuit suggests. \nIf that\u2019s true, it was both inappropriate for Page to arrange such a private meeting and for the two of them to take it. Aside from the obvious unfairness to other chief candidates, it suggests a fundamental lack of understanding \u2014 or perhaps acceptance \u2014 of the police board\u2019s public mission and public accountability.\nSetting up meetings with business leaders or other allies is one thing; arranging them with incoming members of the official governing board is quite another. \nHerein lies the problem that is much larger than Barton\u2019s performance, or lack thereof. At a time when there\u2019s no greater need than regaining public trust and providing a sense of accountability to the conduct of the police department, the board is collectively trapped in a loop of secrecy and deflection. \nThe operative word is \u201ccollectively\u201d because there\u2019s no evidence that, individually, the police board members are anything less than qualified and honorable good citizens giving of their time for the greater good. But as anyone who understands the dynamics of governing boards can relate, it\u2019s not uncommon for the whole to be far less than the sum of its parts. \nThe good intentions of the commissioners are not in question, but if there\u2019s any commitment to transparency and accountability, not even the shrewdest police detective could uncover it. The most recent example came from Price himself about a month ago in an encounter with Christine Byers, KSDK\u2019s star reporter, over why the board had inexplicably given Barton a $12,000 raise just seven months into a stormy tenure. \n\u201cPrice was unwilling to discuss the board\u2019s reasons for giving Barton a raise with a reporter, or comment on the board\u2019s opinion of her performance as chief,\u201d Byers reported. \u201c\u2018That\u2019s personnel, and I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss it publicly, and that\u2019s something we can\u2019t comment on so thank you very much,\u2019 Price said before hanging up on a reporter.\u201d \nThat\u2019s right: Price hung up on Byers for asking an obvious and proper question. In a nutshell, that tells you all you need to know about the arrogance of this guy, and by extension, a board that would select him as his chairman. \nNo, the reasons behind hiring a police chief are not \u201cpersonnel\u201d and somehow off limits to the public. Nor are decisions to grant that person a whopping 8 percent raise less than a year after hiring her, in stark contrast to the 2 to 3 percent raises (or none) given to members of her department. \nIn case the good judge forgot, the salaries of police officers are a matter of public record, just like those of all county employees, and decisions regarding raises are very much the public\u2019s business. Just like the people of St. Louis County are entitled to an explanation better than \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d for the chairman of its police board resigning abruptly for no stated reason halfway through his term in office. \nOh, and by the way, multiple sources are telling us that Price\u2019s decision to resign was very related to the department\u2019s ongoing soap-opera drama over \u201cpersonnel\u201d issues that the public doesn\u2019t get to know about. We\u2019ll get back to you on that one. \nAt least give the police board credit for consistency. This is very much in keeping with its decision to outsource accountability to the business community, and in particular Centene, a company that is far and away Page\u2019s largest campaign contributor. It\u2019s also a company that hired as its security chief former County Police Chief Jon Belmar, widely known in police circles to have had a mutual non-admiration society with Doyle.  \nWhat could go wrong with any of that? \nPerhaps the remaining members of the board should take to heart the top-line findings of the report that the business interests had delivered to the county by the private consultants at Teneo Group:\n\u201cIn terms of immediate areas of opportunity for improvement, Teneo Risk has identified three major findings:  \n1. The department must improve its crime-fighting methods, and it must better coordinate with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department to collaboratively reduce violent crime. \n2. There is a racial divide among the department\u2019s employees. While deeply troubling, this divide provides the chief with an opportunity to lead positive organizational and cultural change. \n3. The department must improve its engagement with the community it serves, the government entities it works with, its own employees, and the many and varied media that portray what the department does day-to-day to serve the public.\u201d \nOf particular interest here are items 2 and 3. Of course, Barton made her infamous public debut in June by making the jaw-dropping statement that there was no systemic racism in the county police department. Even setting aside the detail that she was empirically wrong \u2014 and that her statement came at the height of racial tensions and protests over the murder of George Floyd \u2014 Barton\u2019s self-unaware whiffing on an empty net was breathtaking. \nRather than own up to the unforced error, Barton responded by largely hiding from the media, pretty much the opposite of \u201ccommunity engagement,\u201d to borrow Teneo\u2019s phrase. But in fairness to her, she is following the lead in this regard of the commissioners who appointed her. \nBarton achieved the near impossible by making matters worse in a clumsy, belated St. Louis Post-Dispatch interview last week in which she acknowledged that the community was unreceptive since she uttered her never-retracted initial gaffe. \nStill, Barton isn\u2019t the real problem, long term. Far more consequentially, St. Louis County has a runaway board of police commissioners that doesn\u2019t know or care about who\u2019s the boss. It isn\u2019t Page or his administration.

            "text": " The term \"global warming\" was changed to, \"global climate change\" a few decades ago because of the fact that the atmosphere is not warming at the same rate all over. In fact, changing weather patterns actually have some locations cooling. One rather conspicuous spot of cooling is in the northern Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland. The air there is cooling because the ocean there is cooling due to an increase in melt water from the Greenland glacier. This is fresh water (not salty) which is disrupting the flow of the saltier, heavier water of the Gulf Stream, which carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico toward the British Isles. A recent study in Nature Geoscience used ocean sediments to construct a history of the Gulf Stream and determined that the current has weakened 15% since the mid-20th Century. Potential impacts include an enhancement of European summer droughts. "

According to a Michigan State Police press release, at approximately 7:30 p.m. troopers from the Cadillac Post along with deputies from the Wexford County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to a two-vehicle crash on M-115 at the intersection of Mackinaw Trail in Clam Lake Township. The investigation resulted in the arrest of a 44-year-old Westmont, Illinois man for operating while intoxicated. The initial investigation revealed the at-fault driver from Illinois was in a 2020 GMC Sierra with a 53-year- old man from LeRoy. They were traveling southbound on Mackinaw Trail at the intersection of M-115 when he failed to yield the right of way of a Ford F250 traveling east on M-115. The occupants of the Ford F250, a 35-year-old Charlotte man and a 36-year-old Onondaga woman, remained on scene as the two occupants of the GMC Sierra fled on foot. The driver of the GMC Sierra and his passenger were located hiding in bushes along the roadway a short distance from the crash. The driver was arrested and lodged at the Wexford County Jail. The report will be turned over to the Wexford County Prosecutor\u2019s Office for review of possible additional charges. M-115 was shut down for approximately one hour because of the crash and arrest. No apparent injuries were reported.

            "text": " LA PAZ, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian Energy Minister Rafael Alarcon said Friday that Chinese company Sinohydro has won a tender to build the Ivirizu hydroelectric dam. Sinohydro won the second tender for the project, after the first was canceled on various technical grounds. The Ivirizu project will be developed over four years, with an investment of over 550 million U.S. dollars to bring 279.9 megawatts to the national grid once completed. A total of five working groups will build the dam itself as well as tunnels, while installing hydromechanical equipment and setting up transmission lines, Alarcon said in the city of Cochabamba. The construction has been given a budget of 190 million dollars, he added. The complex will have two hydroelectric power plants -- Sehuencas, which will produce 188.62MW, and Pelton, which will generate 64MW. The two structures will receive water from the Ivirizu river and transmit the energy through a high-tension voltage line to a sub-station in the municipality of Mizque.

            "text": " While the U.S. and Afghanistan focus on ongoing peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar, the murders of three female journalists in Jalalabad last week illustrate how high the stakes are for those who are not at the decision-making table but have a vested interest in the outcome -- Afghan women. In many ways, Afghan women are less hopeful about their future today than they were a decade ago. While Afghan women have made significant gains in civil rights and education in that time, in 2019, their ratings for where they see their lives in the next five years were more than three points lower than they were 10 years prior -- standing at 2.3 on a scale of zero to 10, where 10 is the best possible life. However, men are also less optimistic about the future than they were a decade ago -- underscoring the uncertainty that hangs over all Afghans, regardless of gender. The trajectory for men has followed a path similar to women's over the past decade, and they've been even less optimistic at several points along the way. Alt text: Line graph. This is the trend line for where Afghan women and Afghan men see their lives in five years, based on a scale from zero to 10, where 10 is the best possible life. Some of women's loss of hope may be related to the fact that fewer women feel like they have control over their futures. Afghan women in 2019 were less than half as satisfied with the freedom they have to choose what they do with their lives as they were in 2008. Slightly more than three in 10 (31%) Afghan women were satisfied with their lives in 2019, compared with the 66% who said so a decade earlier. Notably, Afghan women are not alone in feeling this way. As their country has been marred by violence and political turmoil, Afghan men were also less likely to feel satisfied with their freedom in 2019 than they were a decade ago. However, the decline has been sharper for women, and Afghan men have consistently been more satisfied with their lives than their female counterparts. Alt text: Line graph. This is the trend in how satisfied Afghan women and men are with the freedom to choose what they do with their lives from 2008 to 2019. In addition to feeling less satisfied with their freedom to choose what they do with their lives, Afghan women today are also less likely to feel that they are treated with respect than they were a decade ago. A record-low 42% of Afghan women said they felt treated with respect the day before in 2019 -- down from 64% in 2008. Alt text: Line graph. This is the trend for whether Afghan men and Afghan women felt treated with respect all day the previous day to the survey, from 2008 to 2019. The 42% of women treated with respect was a record low for Afghan women. Continuing violence and insecurity, along with food insecurity and declining economic opportunity, have contributed to Afghans losing faith in their nation's future. Despite their gains, Afghan women still have fewer job opportunities than men, and most Afghan women have only a primary school education. These limitations continue to put Afghan women in a most vulnerable position in their society. As the U.S. government and the Taliban negotiate peace, questions remain regarding the future of gender equality and women's rights in the country. After four decades of war and social upheaval, the need for peace and security in Afghanistan is paramount to all Afghans, but the interests of the country's women also need to be represented in the negotiations.

            "text": " Photo Credit: Disney/Marvel Studios Paul Bettany as Vision, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff in WandaVision WandaVision ended its nine-episode run on Friday, giving closure to Wanda Maximoff's (Elizabeth Olsen) Westview chapter, and setting up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe through two post-credits scenes \u2014 at least two upcoming Phase Four movies (and maybe more). The Marvel Studios series' success is naturally making folks wonder when they can expect WandaVision season 2. Unfortunately, the answer is a \u201cno\u201d on that front. You could've figured that out if you watched it through the end. Or better yet, if you read the WandaVision episode title: \u201cThe Series Finale.\u201d Marvel trolled us here and there, but that's as definite as it gets. Spoilers ahead for all of WandaVision.  Also seeWandaVision Review: Marvel's Endgame Boom Made This Experiment Possible Except \u2014 it may not be that definite. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige, in his appearance at last month's Television Critics Association event, said: \u201cI've been at Marvel too long to say a definite \u2018no' to anything as far as a second season of WandaVision.\u201d That leaves Marvel enough wiggle room in case it decides to do a WandaVision season 2 sometime in the future. But at TCA, Feige also noted what Marvel has repeatedly spoken about in the past: \u201cLizzie Olsen will go from WandaVision to the Doctor Strange film.\u201d He's talking about Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (or more simply, Doctor Strange 2), which finds Olsen joining Benedict Cumberbatch in his sequel movie. This makes sense on some accounts. WandaVision villain Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn) namechecked Doctor Strange when she referred to the \u201cSorcerer Supreme\u201d in WandaVision episode 9, while talking about the Darkhold book. And then, in the WandaVision episode 9 post-credits scene, as she pored through the Darkhold, Wanda revealed that she can separate her astral self (that looks like Scarlet Witch) from her physical self (who was casually sipping tea in the mountains somewhere). Just like Doctor Strange, whom we saw doing so in his first film. In the finale, Wanda also says that she wants to fully understand her powers, so it's only logical she would seek out the only other sorcerer she knows. How their journey is intertwined beyond that is up for speculation. Doctor Strange will likely go up against his former ally Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who lost faith in Strange in the first film. Meanwhile, the WandaVision finale post-credits scene ended with Wanda hearing her twin boys' (that's Tommy and Billy) screams for help. That is curious, because they were believed to have been erased away after Wanda brought the Westview Hex to a close. Is this a trick by some villain? Or are they calling out to her from another dimension? After all, the Doctor Strange sequel is titled Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. How heavily will Wanda be involved in that film? Feige has previously said that WandaVision would directly setup Doctor Strange 2, which suggests that her story will be continued. But is that the end of the road for Wanda \u2014 or might there be more for her in store? That is entirely unclear. Of course, a WandaVision season 2 would also need Vision. And he's gone (again). For what it's worth, this has happened before. Vision died in Avengers: Infinity War, remained dead in Avengers: Endgame, but still got a full series (in WandaVision). And oh, a new (white) Vision flew away in the WandaVision finale \u2014 so I'm guessing he's still around. After all, as Wanda said to Vision in the finale: \u201cWe will say hello again.\u201d All nine WandaVision episodes are streaming on Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is slated to release March 25, 2022 in cinemas. For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and Google News.

Los trabajos se ejecutan en Canuto, parroquia del cant\u00f3n Chone, y en Pimpiguas\u00ed, del cant\u00f3n Portoviejo. \u201cEst\u00e1 derrocado el puente de Pimpiguas\u00ed y se desarma la estructura met\u00e1lica del puente en Canuto. Los pasos provisionales de circulaci\u00f3n por esta Red Vial Estatal (RVE) est\u00e1n habilitados, se\u00f1alizados y con la remediaci\u00f3n ambiental para evitar que el polvo cause estragos en la poblaci\u00f3n que utiliza esta v\u00eda\u201d, indic\u00f3 el subsecretario para la zona 4, Iv\u00e1n Ganchozo Villavicencio.  El MTOP contrat\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n de varias obras, mediante un contrato multimodal. Los trabajos implican el desmontaje de la estructura met\u00e1lica, previo a la construcci\u00f3n del puente Canuto sobre  el r\u00edo  Grande, que est\u00e1 ubicado en la RVE E-384, Chone-Calceta-Jun\u00edn-Pimpiguas\u00ed; y, el derrocamiento del puente de hormig\u00f3n de Pimpiguas\u00ed, en la misma RVE.  La inversi\u00f3n del Gobierno Nacional en estas dos obras es de m\u00e1s USD 5 millones, y est\u00e1 contratada con el consorcio China Road And Bridge Corporation (CRBC) \u2013 China NationalElectronicsImport&Export (CEIEC). El puente de Canuto tendr\u00e1 40 metros de longitud, y el de Pimpiguas\u00ed ser\u00e1 de 30 metros de longitud, as\u00ed lo inform\u00f3 el subsecretario. El  contrato multimodal, tambi\u00e9n prev\u00e9 la construcci\u00f3n del puente Las Golondrinas en Esmeraldas y los trabajos para la rehabilitaci\u00f3n del Aeropuerto de Manta, con una inversi\u00f3n total de m\u00e1s de USD 60 millones en este proyecto. Estas obras se levantan con recursos financiados por el Gobierno Nacional, a trav\u00e9s de la Secretar\u00eda de la Reconstrucci\u00f3n, con un cr\u00e9dito del Eximbank.  \u201cLa construcci\u00f3n de los puentes responde a un compromiso presidencial con Manab\u00ed\u201d, dijo Ganchozo. La estructura anterior del puente Pimpiguas\u00ed generaba represamiento que ocasionaba inundaciones en la zona. El estudio permiti\u00f3 que se eleve a 2,60 metros y el r\u00edo tenga su cauce normal. Para poder ejecutar el trabajo de demolici\u00f3n, se realiz\u00f3 el paso provisional que posee todas las medidas de seguridad. De acuerdo a la programaci\u00f3n tiene un 30% de ejecuci\u00f3n. Se realizar\u00e1 el hincado de 100 pilotes y luego el armado y levantamiento de la estructura. Se solicita a los usuarios viales mucha precauci\u00f3n al circular por el sector donde se ejecutan las obras. Se construy\u00f3 reductores de velocidad (resaltos) para evitar el exceso de velocidad y est\u00e1 todo se\u00f1alizado para que el tr\u00e1fico vehicular fluya por estos sectores productivos de Manab\u00ed.

            "text": " An estimated\u00a03 million students\u00a0in the United States\u00a0have gone \u201cmissing\u201d during the pandemic\u00a0\u2014 not from home, but from virtual school. They are no longer attending classes and are most likely falling behind. Even after the pandemic ends, many\u00a0might\u00a0never go back.\u00a0 We are devastated by that number. Not just as parents and as advocates for the nation\u2019s children, but also as two people who grew up with family struggles and the difficulties brought on by economic instability. If the pandemic had happened at an earlier time in our lives, we or someone we know could have been one of those millions of kids. For many low-income students, inequitable learning conditions are not new \u2014\u00a0but they have been exacerbated by the pandemic. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that these same students are experiencing learning loss and chronic absenteeism at\u00a0higher rates\u00a0than their peers during the COVID-19 crisis. We can\u2019t let that continue. The solution is to provide whole-child supports that meet students\u2019 needs outside the classroom:\u00a0access to food, health care, afterschool programs, counseling, and housing and job referrals for parents. These essential services successfully get children in economically strapped families back to learning, and our nation\u2019s leaders must prioritize funding them so that no student is missing from school. As we near a year since thousands of schools first closed their doors last spring, President Joe Biden has made quickly reopening school buildings and getting millions of students and teachers back into the classroom a\u00a0top priority.\u00a0His plan focuses on safety first and offers\u00a0$130 billion in funds for K-12 schools\u00a0to help reduce in-person class sizes and take other steps to prevent COVID-19 transmission.\u00a0 Figuring out how to get more students in the door as safely as possible\u00a0is important. As difficult as community debates over school reopening have been, educators, parents and children agree that students learn best in the classroom. Many experts believe in-person learning will ensure the most at-risk children are less likely to be left behind. But while returning to buildings might\u00a0help reverse learning loss and bring some of the missing children back, it won\u2019t solve the problem entirely if children are still hungry, if their social and emotional needs are unmet,\u00a0and if their families are still struggling to afford health care and school supplies.\u00a0 Families need options:Why school choice is essential to ensuring racial equality An effective way to provide wraparound services that enable children to learn is by embedding nonprofit partners to coordinate them in schools, ensuring students\u2019 needs are all met in one place. This approach, called integrated student supports, also benefits the schools, allowing educators to prioritize student learning while knowing families will get help. Schools require additional federal funding to provide these services, as well as coordinators to run them. It\u2019s the only way to get kids back to in-person or virtual schoolrooms and prevent further learning loss,\u00a0especially in low-income communities where students are falling off the most.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t just a vision. It\u2019s already working in 2,900 schools across the nation.\u00a0Communities in Schools, a national education nonprofit, found that schools providing integrated students supports last year were able to keep\u00a099% of students\u00a0in the education system. Students and their families receive exactly the right support for them, no matter the mode of learning, whether it\u2019s mental health checks and telehealth services, regular meal distribution, reliable internet access, or mentoring and academic support.\u00a0 These wraparound services do more than just keep kids in school \u2014 they set them up for success. Low-income kids were\u00a0disadvantaged\u00a0by the education system when we were in school, and they overwhelmingly still are today.\u00a0The two of us were able to fulfill our potential because of organizations like the integrated student supports provider Communities In Schools and the afterschool network of Boys & Girls Clubs. Rey now leads CIS\u2019\u00a0national network, and Shaquille founded The Shaquille O\u2019Neal Foundation to fund out-of-school-time programs for the millions of kids who were forgotten long before the pandemic. These proven models have adapted to our time of social distancing, and they are helping kids get through a pandemic as well as through the difficulties of everyday life. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona:Here's my five-point plan to get students back in school full time There\u2019s no sugarcoating it. The nation is failing students everywhere. In Los Angeles, one-third of high school students are\u00a0not regularly logging on\u00a0for online learning. In Houston, 42% of students received a\u00a0failing grade\u00a0last autumn\u00a0compared with\u00a026% in the fall of 2019. In Washington, D.C., students are now\u00a0four months behind\u00a0in math and one month behind in reading, compared with\u00a0regular years.\u00a0 We can do better. Whether schools are virtual, hybrid, or in person, we can meet everychild\u2019s most critical needs so that learning can go on, long after we put COVID-19 in the history books.\u00a0 Shaquille O\u2019Neal is founder of The Shaquille O\u2019Neal Foundation, which helps underserved youth achieve their full potential, and a member of the national board of directors of Communities in Schools, the national organization that ensures all students are on a path to success. He is an alumnus of the Boys & Girls Clubs. Rey Salda\u00f1a is president and CEO of Communities In Schools. As a student, he was supported by Communities In Schools \u2013 San Antonio. Later, he served four terms as a San Antonio City Council member."

            "text": " News The Inter-American Development Bank today announced the approval of a $1 billion line of credit to Ecuador for a comprehensive road infrastructure program. The program supports the Ecuadorian government\u2019s medium- and long-term strategy to expand, upgrade and maintain the national road network, a key infrastructure for competitiveness, economic and social inclusion and regional integration. The IDB\u2019s Board of Executive Directors authorized a first loan totaling $350 million under the credit line. Part of these resources will finance the construction of an additional bridge over the Babahoyo River, alleviating a bottleneck in the road linking the port city of Guayaquil and the Dur\u00e1n canton. The loan will also help cover road maintenance contracts by levels of service, preventing premature deterioration and containing the costs of refurbishing some 810 kilometers of paved roadways, including the E40 route linking Salinas, Santa Elena and Guayaquil. The IDB will support the design and implementation of measures to increase road safety (horizontal and vertical signage, guardrails, etc.) along specific stretches of the road network. Additionally, the loan will finance technical studies for road maintenance work as well as for future infrastructure projects to be financed using the line of credit. It will also cover the costs of external audits of the program. These investments are expected to reduce transportation costs and travel time, improve road safety conditions and preserve infrastructure on key corridors of Ecuador\u2019s road network. It will also strengthen the Ministry of Transportation and Public Work\u2019s capacity for planning and managing infrastructure investments. The first loan of the line of credit is for 25 years, with a six-year grace period and a LIBOR-based variable interest rate. Ecuadorian counterpart resources will total $16.5 million for this initial phase of the program. \u00a0\u00a0"

Ramirez, who is allegedly seeking to succeed President Ivan Duque next year, took to Twitter to claim the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) had made a \u201cmonumental error\u201d claiming the security forces executed more than 6,400 civilians to present them as combat kills between 2002 and 2008. The JEP on Saturday ordered the correction of a spelling errors in last month\u2019s bombshell report on army executions in which the court said to prioritize investigations into the mass killing of civilians in the years far-right former President Alvaro Uribe was president. Extrajudicial executions  The corrections did not affect the registered number of executed civilians, but Martinez was quick to demand explanations for the \u201cmonumental error\u201d in the statistics \u201cthat have been been killing the institutional legitimacy and our Armed Forces\u201d and her political ambitions. When is the JEP going to come out and publicly explain the reason for this monumental \u201cerror\u201d in the figures for which they have been killing the institutional legitimacy and our Armed Forces in the media and social networks for two weeks. The court had already specified that it had combined and purified databases from the prosecution and victims\u2019 organizations last month. Martinez is in for a treat as her political responsibility for the mass killing of civilians is not to the only war crime that could end her political career in disgrace. A previous report by the Council of State indicated that the VP used civilians as a human shield when she used the exclusive Club Nogal in Bogota as her office while she was a military target of the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group. The FARC bombed Club Nogal in 2003, killing 36 people and leaving almost 140 people injured. Martinez left the private club shortly before the attack. Why Colombia\u2019s government opposes FARC terrorism victims  The VP may also see her presidential ambitions ruined by her responsibility for a military assault on the city of Medellin during the so-called \u201cOperation Orion\u201d in 2002. The military operation received the support of local crime lord \u201cDon Berna,\u201d who subsequently assumed control over the eastern \u201cComuna 13\u201d and subjugated the locals to terror. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights condemned the operation, which is currently also under investigation by the JEP, as a crime against humanity. The shocking things Colombia\u2019s war crimes tribunal found in Medellin  Ramirez spent little more than a year in office as defense minister due to the quickly accumulating human rights violations. Since taking office as VP in 2018, media additionally revealed that Martinez\u2019 brother is a convicted drug trafficker and that her husband\u2019s business partner is one of the Medellin Cartel\u2019s former drug traffickers. Notwithstanding, Ramirez apparently believes to have a shot in the 2022 elections. @2008-2019 - Colombia Reports. All Rights Reserved. Powered by Digitale Zaken and Parrolabs"

            "text": " Mongabay Series: Amazon Infrastructure International development finance institutions (DFIs) have enabled large-scale deforestation in the Amazon, with no sign the trend is abating, according to recent research published by Boston University\u2019s Global Development Policy Center. Instead, say lead authors Rebecca Ray, Kevin Gallagher and Cynthia Sanborn, \u201cevidence suggests that [environmental risks and costs] will accelerate.\u201d DFI-financed projects triggered significant deforestation in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia between 2000 and 2015, according to the study. Using satellite data, the authors analyzed 84 projects, and determined that the area around them \u201cexperienced tree cover loss at a rate of over four times the average in comparable areas without projects in these countries.\u201d That\u2019s a forest carbon-sink loss equivalent to the annual emissions of Colombia, Chile, and Ecuador, combined. Andean Amazon nations are currently \u201cexperiencing a surge in infrastructure projects,\u201d the authors report, with DFI-backed projects increasingly pushing into the Amazon basin itself. Just under half of the 60 DFI-financed projects carried out in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia from 2000-2015 were located in the Amazon basin. But 45 out of the 57 DFI-backed projects completed since 2015, or currently planned, are, or will be, located there. The analyses provide critical grounds for caution: infrastructure currently accounts for 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and yet, some international DFIs seek to increase their lending from \u201cbillions to trillions\u201d in order to address massive global infrastructure demand \u2013 forecast to be as high as $97 trillion by 2040. This could be very bad news for South American nations trying to meet their targeted Paris Climate Agreement goals (which in countries like Brazil are linked to preventing deforestation), and for the international community as it tries to curb potentially catastrophic greenhouse gas emissions. International DFIs financed roughly 100 infrastructure projects in Amazon-basin countries between 2000 and 2015. The majority of them (84) were built in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, so Ray and her co-authors focused their study there. DFIs examined in the Boston University study included the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Development Bank of Latin America, Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES), China Development Bank, and Export-Import Bank of China. A few other international DFIs have been active in financing infrastructure in the Amazon, said Ray, \u201cbut in much more minor ways and primarily by co-financing with DFIs that have a deeper history in the region.\u201d During the 15 year period studied, international DFIs primarily supported highway construction and improvement, and also new hydroelectric dams \u2013 the latter once seen as carbon neutral, but increasingly coming under scrutiny as a large source of greenhouse gas emissions, independent of the deforestation that can result from dam construction. Other projects included ports, renewable energy plants, and thermoelectric plants. Most of the construction included in the study occurred on the edge of the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Pacific coast of Peru, and in Southern Bolivia. Notably, of the projects that international DFIs financed in Brazil during this period, none were in the Amazon basin. Excluded were Brazilian projects financed domestically by BNDES, such as the heavily criticized Belo Monte Dam. The reason for this, says Ray, was that the study focused only on cross-border finance in order to hone in on the relationship between local communities, national governments, and external lenders. Most of the deforestation, say the study authors, can be attributed to \u201cthe direct impacts of the projects, as well as indirect impacts such as illegal mining that can follow official opening of the forest.\u201d Peru\u2019s Southern Interoceanic Highway was one of the most damaging. By 2015, more than 15 percent of the forested area within 10 kilometers (roughly 6 miles) of the 403-kilometer (250 mile) road had been deforested. The highway was financed by the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF). The Riberalta-Guayamer\u00edn highway in northern Bolivia was also particularly impactful. Nearly half the tree cover within one kilometer (0.6 miles) of the road was lost by 2015. Over the same period, areas in Bolivia not near an international DFI-financed infrastructure project experienced a seven percent tree cover loss. The Riberalta-Guayamer\u00edn highway was also financed by CAF. Such findings came as little surprise to Scott Edwards, Executive Director of Conservation Strategy Fund, a Washington D.C.-base international environmental NGO: \u201cIn CSF\u2019s 20 years of experience working on infrastructure development issues, we have come to some similar conclusions.\u201d However, Edwards believes the environmental performance of some DFIs has significantly improved over the last few decades. \u201cI think that there has been a more concerted effort by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank to respond to public pressure for greater and more stringent safeguards,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the same level of performance can be applied to the other banks.\u201d The Boston University study disagreed with that more positive view, finding that, \u201cthere is no one model or bank that performs the best,\u201d said Gallagher. What did appear to matter, rather, was whether or not projects were \u201cconducted under regulatory regimes (from either national governments or DFIs) that require prior consultation with affected indigenous communities.\u201d This discovery regarding indigenous consultation was especially salient in Bolivia. There, areas near DFI-financed infrastructure projects which did not require prior consultation experienced a 36.5 percent decline in tree cover. When projects did require prior consultation, the decline was only 21.1 percent. This finding is especially significant as DFIs begin to trend toward funding major projects in the Brazilian basin, where the national government has long been accused of not fulfilling its legal obligation to the National Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169, which requires indigenous consultation before major infrastructure projects get underway \u2013 projects such as mega-dams and railways. Brazil and other Amazon countries are all signatories to this international agreement. In Colombia, areas near DFI-financed projects experienced a similar rate of deforestation as areas without DFI projects \u2013 roughly three percent. All of the projects there had formal prior indigenous consultation processes. Gallagher noted the difficulties in obtaining a precise measure of the social and environmental impacts of DFIs\u2019 Amazon infrastructure activities. \u201cThe DFIs lack measurement and monitoring systems that allow themselves, outside experts, and civil society to measure, monitor, and make projects accountable to their stated goals,\u201d he said. \u201cDFIs are now part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and have to align their policies with them and measure progress.\u201d But progress towards that accountability is questionable. \u201cWhile the DFI lenders have changed over time, and standards on paper have improved, little has changed on the ground,\u201d said Kevin Koenig, Ecuador Program Director for Amazon Watch, an environmental NGO. \u201cWe are seeing some of the same manifest destiny-style development schemes that characterized the region decades ago. It is rapidly turning the Amazon from carbon sink to carbon source at the time the climate \u00ad\u2013 and planet \u2013 can least afford it.\u201d The linking of DFIs to global efforts to combat climate change is critical, analysts emphasized. The Boston University study is not the only one to highlight the continuing carbon-intensity of DFI-supported infrastructure projects. The climate change think tank E3G found that, as of 2017, fossil fuel investments of multilateral development banks such as the World Bank Group and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development still outpaced these institutions\u2019 climate finance activities. A recent World Bank report found that, out of all the infrastructure projects in which both private financiers and multilateral DFIs were involved between 2002-2017, DFIs spent 75 percent more on conventional projects than on low-carbon projects. Of the six DFIs examined in the Boston University study, only the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) responded to Mongabay\u2019s request for comment. Janine Ferretti, Chief of the IDB\u2019s Environmental and Social Safeguards unit, noted that the IDB is \u201caware of the findings report\u201d and met with the authors earlier this year to discuss \u201csome pioneering approaches to Environmental and Social Risk Management.\u201d She said the IDB \u201cwelcomes efforts to examine relationships between project finance and land use change,\u201d calling the study \u201can important contribution.\u201d However, Ferretti also said that \u201cit is important to recognize the methodological challenges to doing this kind of research, arguing that \u201cthere is a need to more clearly establish the timeframe of the actual investment and deforestation that occurred during the period of 2000-2015.\u201d She referred specifically to the Montero-Yapacan\u00ed Road in Bolivia, the widening of which the IDB is currently financing, and one of the case studies featured in the report. Ferretti pointed out that the existing road \u201cgoes back five decades as a two-lane road\u201d and that deforestation in the area \u201coccurred during the course of several decades prior to IDB\u2019s financing of the upgrade due to the clearing of land for the production of sugar cane and other agricultural products.\u201d While the Boston University study does qualitatively link IDB financing to deforestation in the area \u2013 in addition to reporting that social conflict related to unpaid workers has accompanied the project \u2013 it does not count this deforestation in its qualitative analysis of the link between international DFI finance and deforestation. Ferreti added that protecting the environment and the livelihoods of IDB\u2019s stakeholders is the core principle of IDB\u2019s safeguard policies. \u201cWe are ready to apply the mitigation hierarchy and a range of other strategies to identify and solve challenges that may arise during Bank projects and programs,\u201d she said. More than $70 billion worth of infrastructure projects, supported by both development banks and the private sector, are currently planned for the Amazon basin region between now and 2020, according to the Boston University study. These include the Rurrenbaque-Riberalta highway in Bolivia (financed by CHEXIM), the San Gab\u00e1n III dam in Peru (CDB), the Simon Bolivar dam rehabilitation project in Venezeula (CAF), and the Hidroituago dam in Colombia, financed by the IDB, the Chinese fund associated with the Inter-American Investment Corporation, and private banks. A scramble for resources is driving the surge, says Gallagher. \u201cThe Amazon basin is home to oil, timber, soybeans, cattle, and waterways for energy.\u00a0Countries want to exploit these resources, and they want to build infrastructure to facilitate getting these goods to market,\u201d he said. The Chinese policy banks \u2013 the China Development Bank (CDB) and the Export-Import Bank of China (CHEXIM) \u2013 have financed, or are expected to finance, roughly one third of DFI infrastructure projects currently planned for the Amazon basin. China\u2019s dominance as a Latin American infrastructure financier is directly linked to its policy of rapidly growing its influence over agricultural and mining commodities there. Lending commitments to the Latin America-Caribbean region from the China Development Bank, alone, have far outpaced those of any other DFI operating in the region \u2013 reaching more than $33 billion in 2010. According to the Inter-American Dialogue, between 2005 and 2017, CDB and CHEXIM provided the region with more than $150 billion, surpassing support from the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), combined. CDB and CHEXIM have four existing regional funds with Latin America. These include the China-LAC Industrial Cooperation Investment Fund and China-Brazil Fund (both $20 billion), as well as two funds known as the \u201cSpecial Loan Program for China-LAC Infrastructure Projects,\u201d launched in 2014 and 2015, with $10-15 billion and $10 billion, respectively. Importantly, China\u2019s infrastructure construction record at home, across Asia and in South America with respect to environmental and social responsibility and transparency has been poor. Western-led DFIs are looking to step up their infrastructure financing, as well. Multilateral development banks such as the World Bank \u2013 recognizing that they will not be able to muster the funds to fill the multi-trillion dollar gap between global supply of infrastructure finance and global demand in its entirety \u2013 are attempting to draw in private-sector partners. The goal, the banks say, is to increase development financing \u201cfrom billions to trillions.\u201d In a recent op-ed, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim argued that \u201cthe reality is, we won\u2019t come close to achieving [Sustainable Development Goals] unless we work to attract private sector investment.\u201d The World Bank recently approved a $13 billion capital increase, which will double the institution\u2019s current lending levels by 2030. In addition, a U.S. effort to consolidate multiple agencies providing investment to developing countries \u2013 termed the BUILD Act \u2013 is quickly progressing through Congress. The legislation would create a new International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) that would put the USAID Credit Authority, Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and Office of Private Capital and Microenterprise under one roof, with more capital and financial instruments at IDFC\u2019s disposal than the separate entities had before. However, even as international infrastructure investment increases, critics argue that efforts to ensure that this new capital goes toward socially and environmentally sustainable projects have lagged. Writing for Project Syndicate, Gallagher pointed out that \u201cthe current financing pattern of the MDBs [multilateral development banks] \u2013 and particularly the World Bank Group \u2013 is highly carbon intensive.\u201d As it stands, the BULID Act lacks strong social-environmental standards, such as human rights provisions and greenhouse gas caps and accounting processes. \u201cAs the World Bank tries to increase private investment from billions to trillions, it should make a proportional commitment to safeguards and accountability,\u201d urged Natalie Bridgeman Fields, founder and executive director of the Accountability Counsel and a lecturer at Stanford Law School. Whether or not DFI activity results in fewer social-environmental impacts may depend on the extent to which recipient governments set and enforce their own social-environmental standards, said Alfonso Malky, Latin America Technical Director for the Conservation Strategy Fund. \u201cProtection from governments themselves will be the only way to guarantee a significant social and environmental impact reduction in the long term,\u201d he added. However, Latin American governments in Amazon countries including Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia have relatively poor records for environmental and social safeguards during the planning and implementation of large-scale infrastructure. As already mentioned, most of the projects in the Boston study were located in the Andes headwaters region. How rising international financing levels for infrastructure will play out in the Amazon basin remains to be seen. One concerning planned project, said Ray, is the Rositas hydroelectric project in Bolivia. The dam would flood a large, biodiverse area, while affecting more than ten local communities. If built, the 156-meter high, 400 megawatt (MW) hydroelectric dam would sit on the Grande and Rositas Rivers in the Rio Grande Basin. Planned since the 1970s, the project has only relatively recently attracted financing. According to the China Global Dams Database, the Export-Import Bank of China will provide $850 million for the project, while Bolivia\u2019s national electricity company, Empresa Nacional de Electricidad Bolivia (ENDE), will contribute the remaining $150 million. Most of the electricity that the Rosita dam generates appears destined for export. The project is part of a larger hydropower development scheme, consisting of eight mega-dams in the Rio Grande Basin. Taken together, government forecasts say, the eight projects will produce approximately 3,000 MW, roughly twice Bolivia\u2019s maximum national demand. However, Rositas will flood approximately 45,000 hectares (174 square miles) of mostly forested area, according to a 2018 report by Mongabay \u2013 equivalent in size to more than half of New York City. Forest loss due to flooding will result in the elimination of a large carbon sink, while leaving underlying vegetation to rot, releasing large amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Recent analyses performed using the Conservation Strategy Fund\u2019s HydroCalculator tool \u2013 open-source software that utilizes user input data to perform cost-benefit analyses of hydroelectric dams \u2013 estimated that the Rositas dam and reservoir will ultimately result in roughly 70 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions \u2013 more than the state of South Carolina emits annually. In addition, local indigenous communities who stand to be affected by the dam claim that they haven\u2019t been adequately consulted, as required by Bolivian law, and also by the International Labour Organization\u2019s Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (No. 169), to which Bolivia is a signatory. The indigenous communities have filed a lawsuit against Bolvia\u2019s ENDE. \u201cCHEXIM may not be aware that it has been asked to finance a project that could not attract financing elsewhere, which is not necessarily beneficial from a climate perspective, and which carries a risk of serious [indigenous] conflict,\u201d said Ray. While Rositas may be one of the most environmentally-threatening dams on the Amazon basin agenda, a Brazil-Peru Inter-Oceanic Railway, aimed at linking the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, is perhaps the most hotly-debated planned project. The rail line would traverse between 3,000 and 5,000 kilometers (1,800-3,100 miles) \u2013 depending on which route is chosen \u2013 offering a more efficient, less costly, means of transporting commodities from Brazil and other Amazonian countries to China and the rest of Asia. Some expect the railway will decrease the cost of shipping grain from Brazil to China by $30 per ton. Among other likely cargo are iron ore and soybeans from Brazil and gold and copper from Peru. The project has moved forward slowly since its initial announcement, with mixed signals from government to the media. In February, Brazilian Vice Planning Minister for International Affairs Jorge Arbache told Reuters that planning for the transcontinental railway had \u201cstopped, because it was extremely costly and the feasibility study was very unsatisfactory.\u201d He added that, \u201cThe engineering challenges were absurd.\u201d But the Chinese Embassy in Brazil refuted the statement soon after, stating that China, Brazil, and Peru had reached an agreement. In late April, Railway Technology reported that \u201ctalks have been intensifying in recent months.\u201d Vast environmental and social costs are expected to accompany such connectivity. According to Ray, two potential routes are chiefly under consideration. \u201cOne crosses through un-contacted, or voluntarily isolated indigenous territory, along the central Peru-Brazil border.\u2026 The other crosses into southern Peru in the Madre de Dios watershed, in an area that has already been hit by tremendous deforestation linked to informal gold mining that has been made possible due to the CVIS highway in Peru.\u201d A report by the Regional Group on Financing and Infrastructure noted that, out of five possible routes for the railway, four traverse protected areas or indigenous reserves. Paulina Garz\u00f3n, Director of the Bank Information Center\u2019s China-Latin America Sustainable Investment Initiative, told The Guardian that \u201cthis project is iconic and is likely to become center-stage for Latin America civil society organizations. It will be tremendously controversial on both environmental and social fronts.\u201d A transcontinental railroad that decreases the cost of, and shortens the trade route for, commodities transported between the resource-rich Brazilian and Peruvian interiors to rapidly expanding Asian markets, could open the Amazon basin to massive deforestation. The region\u2019s rainforests will be poised to turn into sites of lucrative beef, soy, corn, cotton, sugarcane, and palm oil production; as well as large-scale iron, gold, copper, and aluminum mining. Financing and contracting details for the railway remain uncertain. Chinese, Czech, French, German, Spanish, and Swiss investors and construction companies have all expressed interest, an indication of the assumed profit potential of the project. In 2016, the Inter-American Dialogue speculated that Chinese support would likely come from the CDB-managed Special Loan Program for Chinese-LAC Infrastructure Projects and an already approved credit line to the Bolivian government. According to Railway Technology, Spanish and Swiss-German consortiums, numbering more than 70 companies in total, have been involved in recent discussions. The railway does more than endanger the basin\u2019s rainforests: it also puts global climate stability at risk. With around 17-18 percent of the entire Amazon deforested already, scientists warn that a further increase to 20-25 percent could result in a sudden regional shift in rainfall patterns toward widespread drought and past a tipping point where large swathes of rainforest could rapidly convert to savannah. The loss of the massive carbon storage capacity of Amazon basin forests could result in a large increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases and to intensified global warming past the 2 degree Celsius (3.6 degree Fahrenheit) danger zone recognized by the Paris Climate accord. \u201cOpening up the Amazon to further road building, dam construction, and resource extraction will push the Amazon past its tipping point,\u201d said Koenig. \u201cWe need to have a basin-wide approach for protecting the ecosystems of the Amazon that respects indigenous rights and territories.\u201d Citation: Ray, K.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Reuters Staff 2 Min Read SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China\u2019s West Pacific Petrochemical Corp, or WEPEC, is set to export 900,000 barrels of gasoline to Mexico this month amid a swelling glut of the motor fuel at home, according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter. The three 300,000-barrel cargoes will make up WEPEC\u2019s biggest monthly shipment to the Latin American country, said the source, who asked not to be named. The 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) Dalian-based refinery, one of China\u2019s main export-focused refineries, first sent gasoline to Mexico in the second-half of 2018 as it looked for markets beyond Asian oil hub Singapore, its traditional export destination. The lower-grade export fuel, which has an octane number of 91, is produced by blending lower-grade gasoline with naphtha, said the source, without giving further details. Mexico has become increasingly dependent on fuel imports, mainly from the United States, due to a fall in domestic output because of longstanding refinery problems, forcing state-run Pemex to import nearly 600,000 bpd of fuel last year. The WEPEC refinery, operated by state oil and gas major PetroChina, is one of China\u2019s largest gasoline exporters with monthly overseas shipments estimated at some 1.3 million barrels, said the source. PetroChina did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China is facing a growing overhang of refined oil products after the start-up of two new mega plants coincided with a slowdown in domestic demand, forcing some refineries to scale back output.

            "text": " fresh voices from the front lines of change  by Steven Rosenfeld | Mar 5, 2021 | Blog, Election, Featured | 0 comments After winning a lawsuit to take possession of all of the 2020 presidential ballots and election equipment in Arizona\u2019s most populous county, Arizona\u2019s Republican-led Senate is poised to take 2020\u2019s post-election brawls into new territory where investigating unproven claims of electronically stolen votes, not widespread illegal voting, will be center stage. Many Republicans, including Arizona legislators, have voiced their belief that former President Trump was unfairly denied a second term,\u00a0citing\u00a0various vote-centered conspiracies. In\u00a061 out of 62\u00a0post-election lawsuits filed by Trump\u2019s allies across the country, scores of federal and state judges rejected those assertions as groundless and lacking proof. But now that Arizona\u2019s Senate has affirmed its authority to investigate the accuracy of 2020\u2019s presidential vote count in America\u2019s\u00a0second-largest\u00a0election jurisdiction\u2014Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located\u2014the focus has shifted from legislators\u00a0fanning\u00a0unproven claims of stolen votes to whether Republican lawmakers will conduct a credible evidence-centered inquiry. \u201cThe Senate has and is doing a 100 percent audit, which is why we fought so hard to have access to all the data and documents,\u201d Arizona Senate President Karen Fann\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Facebook on March 2. \u201cWe are doing extensive research, interviewing, and background checks to make sure we find the best team available\u2026 This is and has always been about election integrity and getting answers to our constituents\u2019 questions and concerns.\u201d The exercise will not change the election results, which have been certified. Trump lost Arizona by\u00a010,457 votes, a closer margin than in\u00a0Georgia, where that GOP-led state conducted a manual hand count of all of its presidential election ballots, and then electronically recounted those same paper ballots. It twice confirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Trump before certifying the result. The investigation that is taking shape in Arizona could be as thorough as what was undertaken in Georgia, or it could descend into political theater to placate Trump\u2019s base. \u201cAs you know, there is no credible evidence for any of the conspiracy theories that have abounded about the 2020 General Election,\u201d\u00a0wrote\u00a0Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, to Fann and Sen. Warren Petersen on March 3. \u201cIf your goal is truly to rebuild public confidence in our democracy, it is imperative that you establish and abide by clear procedures and parameters for the security and confidentiality of the ballots and election equipment while in your custody and ensure independence and transparency should you proceed with any further audit.\u201d A Closer Look at 2020\u2019s Closest Swing State? Immediately after Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason\u2019s February 25\u00a0ruling\u00a0authorizing the state Senate\u2019s subpoenas, the county\u2019s supervisors\u2014where\u00a0four out of five\u00a0are Republicans\u2014said that they would not appeal. Its election staff began transferring the election materials, starting with 11 gigabytes of activity logs from its hundreds of voting machines. What soon became apparent was that the senators had been more focused on winning in court than on planning the investigation that they hoped to take on. For example, the Senate had\u00a0not yet\u00a0secured a site for truckloads of materials, starting with 2.1 million paper ballots in sealed boxes on\u00a070 pallets,\u00a0hundreds of voting machines and tabulators, vote count management systems and the related data\u2014digital images of every ballot cast, machine activity logs, and more. As the first week of March began, election experts in Arizona were skeptical that the exercise would be a serious effort to examine the accuracy of Maricopa County\u2019s 2020 results. \u201cIn this case, Sen. Fann and House members are chasing down a rabbit hole that was\u00a0proposed\u00a0by Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell back in November. Now they\u2019re trying to find the evidence,\u201d said Benny White, a longtime Republican Party election observer in Pima County, which is not far from Phoenix. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk poorly about my legislators, but I don\u2019t know what the hell they are doing. They don\u2019t understand election administration at all. They don\u2019t understand how these machines work. They don\u2019t understand how votes are calculated and aggregated. They are in a political position where they think they have to do something [to respond to Trump supporters]. So they\u2019re trying to do something.\u201d Some of White\u2019s skepticism came from Fann\u2019s\u00a0prior endorsement\u00a0of a proposal by a Texas firm, Allied Security Operations Group (ASOG), that had made unfounded claims about the process in Michigan and Arizona. ASOG\u2019s \u201cscope of work\u201d said it would \u201chand count approximately 550,000 of the following paper ballots and scan approximately 55,000 of the following paper ballots\u2026 over a 7-10 day period on site in Arizona for a firm, fixed price fee of $10,000.\u201d White and others said that proposal was not serious. A precise audit does not cherry-pick what ballots to examine, he said, and its fee was unrealistically low. Fann later\u00a0distanced\u00a0herself from ASOG. While neither Fann nor other Senate Republican spokespeople would speak on the record to Voting Booth, several background interviews suggested that the enormity of the actual task before the Republicans was dawning on them. \u201cMy concern is I\u2019m not sure if they know what they\u2019re looking for\u2014or looking at,\u201d said\u00a0Tammy Patrick, who, for 11 years, was the federal compliance officer for Maricopa County\u2019s elections department, has served on a presidential commission for election reform, and now is the senior adviser for elections at the Democracy Fund, a philanthropic organization. \u201cI also don\u2019t think they understand the volume of materials they are talking about. You\u2019re talking about at least one semitractor load for the ballots alone. What are their security protocols going to be?\u201d Most of Hobbs\u2019 letter to the Senate Republican leaders concerned maintaining a catalog of security and inventory controls for the ballots and machinery, as well as urging the Senate to plan for bipartisan teams to count ballots and be as transparent as possible as it proceeded. \u201cI implore you to treat your responsibility for the custody, security, and integrity of those items with the same level of vigilance that election officials across this State treat that responsibility,\u201d the secretary of state wrote. \u201cI again urge you not to waste taxpayer resources chasing false claims of fraud that will only further erode public confidence in our election processes and elected officials.\u201d What Will They Do? Who Will Do It? Maricopa County, and Arizona as a state, both have reputations for well-run elections. While no election is error-free, election officials have\u00a0extensive protocols\u00a0that test their voting system hardware and software, their voting machine performance, and the vote count\u2019s accuracy before and after Election Day\u2014before results are certified. While vote count audits don\u2019t review every vote cast, the process includes political parties choosing samples of ballots that are examined by hand, which\u00a0was done\u00a0following November\u2019s election. In response to Trump supporters\u2019 claims of secret manipulation of vote counts\u2014and GOP legislators encouraging those claims\u2014the county hired two national voting system testing laboratories to examine whether their hardware or software had been hacked or hijacked. They\u00a0found\u00a0no breaches. \u201cWhat\u2019s wild in all of this is that all of the voting equipment had logic and accuracy tests, and those logic and accuracy test reports could be reviewed,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe machinery has also undergone the [post-election] forensic test that was done by two federal testing labs. The challenge that I\u2019ve had with some of this is that voting systems are not just like every other electronic device that\u2019s out there. There are some very specific things that you need to understand about voting systems in order to know what you\u2019re looking at and what it means.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of point to what they\u2019re proposing,\u201d she said, assessing the Senate\u2019s probe. \u201cThey wanted a forensic report, and they got one. And now that\u2019s not enough. Even if they bring in their own specialists, they\u2019re not going to find anything, because there is no \u2018there\u2019 there.\u201d As the week progressed, background interviews with reputable experts advising the Republicans said that the Senate investigation, ideally, would have three focal points. Like Georgia, there would be a full manual hand count of every paper ballot\u2014a massive operation involving potentially hundreds of workers in a giant warehouse. Unlike Georgia, but like the state of\u00a0Maryland\u2014whose electorate is larger than Maricopa County\u2019s\u2014there would be an\u00a0independent audit\u00a0of all of the digital ballot images created by scanners. Even though voters cast paper ballots, digital images of every ballot card are what is counted by Maricopa\u2019s voting system. Third, there would be an analysis of the system\u2019s software and activity logs\u2014detailing every operation by each voting machine\u2014to ensure that the ballot images were correctly read and counted. These steps, if all undertaken and not marred by predetermined conclusions, would arguably be more comprehensive than what Georgia did to verify its 2020 presidential vote. Where politics would re-enter is when Arizona\u2019s Republican legislators have to stand by the results of their process that, in all likelihood, will affirm Trump\u2019s loss. Thus, in 2020\u2019s two presidential swing states with the closest 2020 margins and histories of electing Republicans for president, the evidence would show that Biden won. But before that assessment can occur, the Senate has to hire credible contractors and a reputable audit manager\u2014possibly a former state election director\u00a0like Detroit did\u00a0before its 2020 general election. Additionally, the legislature\u2019s investigation will have to demonstrate the same level of security and inventory controls that are required of local election officials\u2014a point underscored by Hobbs in her letter to the Senate Republican leaders. \u201cYou have stated previously that you believe a further audit by the Senate is critical for the people of Arizona to be able to move forward and trust the 2020 General Election results. I respectfully disagree,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I believe we can agree that proceeding without clear procedures for the security of the ballots and election equipment when they are in your custody, and clear procedures to ensure the integrity, independence, and transparency of the audit itself and the auditors selected, will only open the door to more conspiracy theories and further erosion of voters\u2019 confidence in Arizona\u2019s elections processes.\u201d Steven Rosenfeld is the editor and chief correspondent of\u00a0Voting Booth, a\u00a0project\u00a0of the Independent Media Institute.

            "text": " Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei is reportedly investing US$1.5 billion in the construction of four ICT facilities in the Mexican state of Queretaro. This is the largest investment ever made by a Chinese firm in Mexico, eclipsing all the Chinese investments in Mexico put together in the last decade. The investment\u00a0will\u00a0be made over the next five years and will generate over 1,100 jobs, the Chinese firm said. The four centers will be a Global Technical Care Center, a\u00a0Regional Center for Network Operations, a\u00a0Regional Innovation Center and a\u00a0Regional Technical Training Center. The\u00a0Innovation\u00a0Center is already under construction in El Marqu\u00e9s and is slated to be operational in the second half of 2015. According to a statement by Huawei, Mexico will henceforth serve as its base for selling telecom solutions in the western hemisphere. Mexico\u2019s recent telecom reforms have left the country ripe for investment. British telecom firm Virgin Mobile, for example, has committed to invest $45 million over the next three years. South Korean phone maker Samsung is also talking of investing $100 million to expand its plant in Tijuana. The United States has blocked Huawei from selling telecom gears to government departments because it suspects that the telecom firm is spying for the Chinese government. However, the U.S. government has never attempted to back up its allegations with proof.  Huawei\u2019s largest operations in Latin America\u00a0to date are\u00a0in Brazil, where it controls about 40% of the country\u2019s telecom networking gear market. It was the biggest sponsor of the 2014 Futurecom, the largest telecommunication exhibition in Brazil. \u00a0 News Editor for Nearshore Americas, Narayan Ammachchi is a career journalist with a decade of experience in politics and international business.

            "text": " \"Mamma, mamma, you're famous. I saw you on television!\" This was how eight-year-old Noah Bennett greeted his mother, Sr Milanie Bennett, when she arrived home in Brackenfell on Wednesday, February 17. Earlier that day, Bennett had watched President Cyril Ramaphosa's eyes widen as she inserted a needle into his arm at the Khayelitsha District Hospital in Cape Town. In doing so, she set the ball rolling on an implementation study that has so far seen over 100 000 healthcare workers vaccinated. \"The next day at school Noah read in the newspaper that his mother had made history by vaccinating the president,\" Bennett recalls. \"When I got home from work, he said to me: 'Mum, you made it into the history books!' He was so proud. I think he was the happiest of us all.\" While administering the president's jab, Bennett had no idea she was making headlines around the world. \"I only realised it was being aired live overseas when a friend texted me from Saudi Arabia.\" Remembering the moment, she adds, \"The president was afraid of the long needle; a lot of people are, especially men. So I saw his eyes widen when I removed the cap of the needle. It's about two-and-a-half centimetres long.\" Bennett (47) is speaking to Spotlight from the Piekenierskloof Mountain Resort near Citrusdal. Despite her husband, Langley, having whisked her away for a surprise anniversary weekend, she still honours her commitment to be interviewed. The couple have been married for nine years. It's my job Initially Bennett was reluctant to speak. \"I am a very shy person,\" she says. \"I don't like the limelight and don't like to be praised. It's my job, which I love. I don't think it's something I need to be praised for, you know? But yes, I know that certain things do stand out. Like this.\" Bennett heads the nurses' training department at Khayelitsha District Hospital. She is responsible for placing student nurses from the University of the Western Cape, Stellenbosch University, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, and the Western Cape College of Nursing. While COVID-19 does not fall directly under her jurisdiction, she helped manage COVID-19 beds during the second wave. \"Everyone had to pull together,\" she says. \"It was very difficult.\" Like any other patient Why was she chosen to vaccinate the president? Bennett laughs. \"I was on my way home when the CEO of the hospital called me [to ask] me if I wanted to vaccinate the president. I immediately said: 'No way! No way, I'm not brave enough.' But then I thought, it's the CEO... I can't really say no. So I said, you know what, no problem. I've done the training. I feel confident and competent in my job and would see him as just any other patient I am giving an injection.\" Bennett's journey with nursing started in the Western Cape rural town of Saron. As a child, she looked after her grandfather, an asthma sufferer, who passed away from lung cancer. \"My mom was working in Cape Town, also as a nurse. She was a single mother, so we lived with my grandparents. My grandfather was ill from as long as I can remember. I was always the one he would call for at night when he couldn't breathe, or when he needed his medication. So when I started nursing, I was already very mature. My background was very difficult. I had dealt with difficult situations in my life.\" A future with nursing or psychology After matriculating at Roodezant Secondary School in Saron in 1991, Bennett was intent on planning a bright future. \"I knew from a young age that I wasn't going to stay in Saron forever,\" she says. \"Most of the job opportunities in Saron is to work on a farm, or to work in a factory, or so. I wanted to make something of myself, and of my life. And obviously I wanted something better for my grandparents. So I knew I had to study. I knew I had to work hard. Besides, I've always believed that the world does not owe you anything. So that was my inspiration. I needed to get out of my circumstances. No one else was going to do for me.\" During a gap year in 1992, Bennett was undecided about whether to study nursing or psychology. Landing a scholarship at the Otto Du Plessis Nursing College at Tygerberg Hospital in Bellville decided her fate. She enrolled in 1993. \"When the opportunity came for me to study, I grabbed it with both hands. The bursary included everything: my accommodation, the uniform. There was very little expense for my grandparents. And I've never looked back. It's been 25 years now and I still love nursing like the first day I walked into the classroom,\" she says. After finishing her training, Bennett joined Tygerberg's staff with a stint at the hospital's High Care Cardiac Unit. In 2000, she packed her bags to start work at London's specialist cardiac centre, The Heart Hospital. \"They were recruiting, doing interviews at the V&A Waterfront. I applied for a post, not thinking that I would get one. But I got it, which was really exciting. You know, it was the time sanctions just got lifted and I saw this [as] an opportunity to see the world out there.\" The Heart Hospital in Marylebone, is affiliated to the University College of London and the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS). It conducted over 1 000 heart surgeries a year before being refurbished in 2015. Bennett relays a stand-out moment: \"I think I was about 31 at the time [and] a senior staff nurse, the equivalent of a shift leader here in South Africa. It was a year of bad snow in London. And most of my colleagues could not get to the hospital. So I ended up only with two nurses and myself, and I had to manage a busy heart unit with about twenty patients between the three of us,\" she recalls. \"This is where my South African experience really kicked in, because as South Africans we are used to working under pressure and under difficult circumstances. Basically, I was the one managing the whole ward that day; managing the theatre schedule [and] people coming back from the theatre, continuously because we could not stop people that were scheduled for heart surgery. I managed to keep my cool, it wasn't easy.\" During Bennett's ten years at The Heart Hospital, she honed her love for training nurses; she made friends from around the world and travelled plenty. A favourite destination was Belfast. \"The Irish people, I find them warmer than the British,\" she says. Then there was Spain, Portugal, Thailand, and more. Coming home It was during a trip back to South Africa to attend a friend's wedding in 2008 that she met Langley, an accountant.

But at the time, Bennett was not ready to move back to Cape Town - yet. The next year, at a party in Regent's Park, she celebrated obtaining British citizenship. \"A very proud moment in my life,\" she says. \"Langley and I found ourselves in a difficult situation,\" recalls Bennett. \"At the time, I wasn't ready to come home. I loved London so much and I couldn't see myself living anywhere else. So we were in a long-distance relationship. But in the end, one of us needed to make the decision, and it wasn't going to be him.\" Langley is very family-orientated, she says. \"So I made the choice to come home. I missed my family a lot too. I mean, you can make so much money, later that money doesn't really bring you joy when you are alone and far away from your family.\" Bennett married Langley in 2012. Because of her ingrained self-reliance, initially she struggled to let him lead too. \"Strangely, when I met my husband, it was difficult sometimes for me to stand back, because taking the lead is just how I grew up,\" she says, laughing. When not in her nursing uniform, she enjoys road trips exploring South Africa's countryside, shopping, and sewing. Recent creations include a Batman costume for Noah. As a frontline worker, Bennett is waiting her turn to receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the Khayelitsha District Hospital. She says each day names of healthcare workers to be vaccinated are put forward. With the media spotlight on her, Bennett would like to leave a message to young people from difficult backgrounds. \"Rise above your circumstances,\" she says. \"I did, and I don't regret my humble beginnings for one moment. It made me the person I am. I often joke saying I was never a child, because I had to grow up so quickly. But I don't regret anything about it. It really moulded me into who I am today.\" Read the original article on spotlight.

Annual coal consumption will be kept to around 4.2 billion tpy at the end of 2025, it said. The report revealed that mergers and acquisitions will be encouraged amid efforts to eliminate backward coal production capacity in the next 5 years, and 10 super large coal enterprises will be established each with an output of 100 million tpy. The coal sector has been tackling overcapacity in the past 5 years. By the end of last year, approximately 5500 coal mines had been closed and approximately 1 billion tpy of coal output capacity had been eliminated, the report said. On the other hand, China has built some 1200 large and modern coal mines, each with an output capacity above 1.2 million tpy, which contribute around 80% of the country's total coal output, the report said.

            "text": " \n \u00a0\u00a0COVID-19ElectionsEuropean CommissionStefan YanevcoronavirusBoyko Borisov  Thailand will from next month reduce its mandatory quarantine from 14 to seven days for foreigners arriving in the country who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, its Health Minister said on Monday. Vaccinations must be administered within three months of the travel period and visitors will still be required to show negative COVID-19 test results within three days of their departure, Anutin Charnvirankul told a news conference. Those not yet inoculated but with coronavirus-free certificates would be quarantined for 10 days, he said. \"Foreigners travelling to Thailand with vaccination certificates in accordance with the requirements of each brands, will need to quarantine for only seven days,\" Anutin said, referring to the doses needed to be effective. Thailand's flight limits, its strict entry requirements and mandatory quarantine for all arrivals have been central to its success in limiting the spread of the virus to just over 26,000 cases and 85 deaths. Those curbs have decimated its vital tourism sector, however, prompting widespread jobs losses and business closures and contributing to the country's deepest economic traction in over two decades. The country received close to 40 million visitors in 2019. The new measures do not apply to those travelling from Africa, who would still be subject to quarantine for two weeks due to concerns about other variants of the virus. Vaccinated Thai nationals without a certificate showing they are coronavirus-free need to spend one week in quarantine after two negative tests in the country. After October, if Thailand inoculates 70% of medical personnel and at-risk groups, there could be more easing of restriction, Anutin said, adding it was possible quarantine could be waived completely. Thailand has so far vaccinated 27,497 people, mostly medical workers, using the Sinovac Biotech vaccine. It has ordered 61 million doses in total of the AstraZeneca vaccine with mass vaccinations slated to begin in June Anutin said the country may need to order an additional 10 to 20 million doses, which it could source from other producers. \u00a0 We need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

They also signed three other ETCAs, one of which was a $6.4 million RMB grant for maintenance of the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium (See: project ID #39786). On November 17, 2013, a ground-breaking ceremony was held for the Five Islands Secondary School. China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) was responsible for the construction. In August 2014, Prime Minister Gaston Browne, who was on an official visit to Beijing, officially informed the principals of CCECC of his Government's desire that China will provide 18 million USD to convert the Five Islands Secondary School now under construction into Antigua State College. He noted that the new proposal will include student dorms, an expanded library, expanded ICT facility, Olympic size swimming pool and tennis courts.During a ground-truthing trip to Antigua, AidData found that the project construction is 95% complete and the school was set to open in September 2016. However, it was unclear whether Chinese only funded the buildings or whether they planned to be involved in running the school/university or funded part of the start up for said school.Ultimately, the intent ended up not mattering, as the building changed hands again in 2017. Antigua State College, under a franchise agreement, ceded the building for the creation of the fourth campus of the University of the West Indies, which sought expansion into Five Islands. China provided 27 million XCD for the funding of this project, which is highlighted in linked project (#54706).  13 7 No China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) [State-owned Company] AidData\u2019s China research began a decade ago with a team of William & Mary faculty, students and staff asking a common question: how do you figure out what China is funding where, and to what effect?

Although not yet official, the business plan could be announced in May, according to Mexican news service Expansi\u00f3n which cited a source close to the matter. Currently, BAIC cars go through final\u00a0assembly in the port city of Veracruz on a ship owned by Mexico\u2019s AT Motors. Each vehicle is taxed with a 21% import tariff.

The proposal would see Tumatumari Hydro Inc. modernize and possibly expand the small hydropower plant as part of the Tumatumari Industrial Development Project. Tumatumari Hydro\u2019s director said the rehabilitation would be conducted in two phases, with the first restoring the plant to its original output capacity and constructing two 30 kilometer transmission lines, and the second expanding the plant\u2019s capacity to 3 MW. The US$5 million overhaul will save Guyana about $40 million in fuel imports over its first decade of operation, officials said, while also creating up to 30 direct and 30 indirect jobs. The project is located at Tumatumari Falls on the Potaro River and was Guyana\u2019s first when completed by British Guiana Consolidated Goldfields to power a gold mining operation in the 1950s. The small hydropower plant was closed amidst a worker strike in the 1960s before being put back into service by the Guyana National Service in 1976. The facility continued to operate through the late 1980s when the last of its two 750 kW Francis turbines failed. Copyright \u00a9 2019 - 2021"

            "text": " \n  NEW DELHI, March 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- On the occasion of International Women's Day 2021, one of India's favourite investment app, ETMONEY has unveiled an investment report based on financial insights collated from its female user-base. The report aims to debunk myths about the financial behaviour of women, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying factors that have paved the way for the success of women investors in India. \n\n\n\n The report reveals that in each of the past 4 years, women investors on ETMONEY have earned around 10% more returns every year as compared to their male counterparts, with their investments offering the best returns in 2020, the year that challenged every investor. This difference in the average annual returns earned by men and women is reflective of two key traits - women investors turning savvier in finance and honing healthier financial habits. Women investors have also mastered the art of maximizing tax savings - with an average of around 15% of their portfolio in ELSS funds, as compared to only 12% of men. This has helpe women combine tax-savings with wealth creation. Additionally, women investors on ETMONEY also have a near-perfect asset-allocation ratio as per their age. They have demonstrated an extraordinary understanding of market movements, upping their investments during market corrections. Besides women demonstrating the hallmarks of being more sound investors as compared to men, they also have their eyes set on their investment goals as they are more regular with their SIP instalments as compared to men. With 4X growth in the amount invested using the platform over the past 4 years, and more women across all age groups and geographies joining in, women are gaining confidence in their ability to invest. This is clear from the rising trend of women from tier II and tier III cities taking to investing, changing the conventional dynamics. \"The role of women in India has undergone a sea change compared to yesteryears, challenging archaic notions of their impact on society at large. Today's crop of modern women is standing tall and playing an active role in IT, Business, Finance, Law, Politics and other major fields. Given our rapidly changing world, financial equality and independence are imperative, and more so for the ones who aspire to build wealth, chase their dreams and live life on their own terms. This realisation is becoming increasingly pervasive as more women in India are becoming cognizant of the importance of investing. At ETMONEY, our primary objective with the investment report is to challenge the myth that women are not as savvy as men in terms of investing, or that they have a risk-averse 'savings' vs an 'investment' mindset. We are grateful to be a part of the financial journey of these women, and urge everyone to take charge of their finances and their lives.\" said Mukesh P Kalra, Founder & CEO of ETMONEY.

            "text": " Accessibility Tools It was the interview that some within Buckingham Palace must have feared \u2014 but Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\u2019s discussion with Oprah Winfrey was more revealing, explosive and potentially damaging to the royal family than many could have imagined. Allegations of racism within the family itself, and Meghan\u2019s admission that she felt suicidal during her pregnancy, have been splashed across newspapers in the United Kingdom. Throughout their two-hour TV special, both Harry and Meghan spoke with eye-opening candor, delivering accusations and rebukes that outweighed even Princess Diana\u2019s landmark interview more than two decades earlier. Here\u2019s a round-up of what we learned from the conversation.   The duchess has hinted before that her mental health suffered during her stint as a senior royal, but during her interview with Winfrey she spoke for the first time about how severe the experience had been. She revealed that life within the royal family was so isolating and lonely, and that she felt so unsupported by the institution, that she contemplated suicide while pregnant with her son Archie. She added that she raised those issues with the palace, but felt unprotected by them. \u201cI went to the institution, and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help, I said I\u2019d never felt this way before \u2026 and I was told that I couldn\u2019t, that it wouldn\u2019t be good for the institution,\u201d Meghan said, adding that she went to \u201cone of the most senior people\u201d to raise the concerns. Emails were sent in which she was \u201cbegging for help,\u201d she added. She told Harry about the ordeal because \u201cI knew that if I didn\u2019t say it, that I would do it \u2014 and I just didn\u2019t want to be alive anymore,\u201d Meghan said. She revealed her thoughts to her husband as they sat on the steps of their cottage. Hours later, the pair had to attend an event in London. \u201cI can\u2019t be left alone,\u201d she remembered telling Harry, after he suggested she stay home. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for that,\u201d Harry said during the interview. \u201cI went into a very dark place as well. I wanted to be there for her.\u201d He said that every day he came home from work after Archie was born, he would arrive to see Meghan crying while breastfeeding their child. But he said he did not broach the topic with other family members. \u201cThat\u2019s just not a conversation that would be had,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them \u2026 For the family, they very much have this mentality of: This is how it is.\u201d The duchess also revealed that she reached out to an unnamed friend of Harry\u2019s mother, Princess Diana, to talk through her struggles. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who to even turn to in that. And one of the people that I reached out to, who\u2019s continued to be a friend and confidant, was one of \u2026 Diana\u2019s best friends. Because it\u2019s like, who else could understand what it\u2019s actually like on the inside?\u201d she told Winfrey. How to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.   Meghan said there was concern within the royal family about her baby\u2019s skin tone, and Harry condemned his relatives for failing to criticize colonial undertones in media coverage. Meghan told Winfrey that an unnamed member of the family raised the issue of how dark their unborn baby Archie\u2019s skin would be while she was pregnant. There were several \u201cconcerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,\u201d she said, in one of the most stunning revelations from the interview. \u201cThat was relayed to me from Harry. Those were conversations that family had with him,\u201d Meghan added, declining to reveal who was involved in the conversations. \u201cThat would be very damaging to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat conversation, I am never going to share,\u201d Harry added. \u201cAt the time, it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.\u201d When Winfrey asked if he could share the questions posed during the conversation, he declined, saying \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with sharing that.\u201d On Monday, Winfrey told CBS that Harry had said the royal in question was not the Queen or Prince Philip. \u201cBut it was right at the beginning,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat will the kids look like? That was at the beginning when she wasn\u2019t going to get security, when my family suggested that she might continue acting (because there wasn\u2019t going to be money for her).\u201d In another part of the broadcast, Harry also criticized the royals for failing to support them when lawmakers pointed out \u201ccolonial undertones\u201d in the way that Meghan was covered in the British press.   \u201cMy father and my brother, they are trapped,\u201d Harry said, lifting the veil on the extreme constraints the couple felt as members of the family. \u201cIt\u2019s a very trapping environment that a lot of them are stuck in,\u201d he added at another point in the broadcast. The pair spoke several times about those constraints, relating them to their relationship with the media, their mental health, and their personal freedom. Harry said he could not have left the family had he not met Meghan. \u201cI was trapped, but I didn\u2019t know I was trapped,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to leave,\u201d he added of his relatives, saying they are \u201ctrapped within the system\u201d and that he has \u201chuge compassion for that.\u201d When Meghan joined the family, she said \u201cthat was the last time, until we came (to the United States), that I saw my passport, my driver\u2019s license, my keys. All that gets turned over.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t call an Uber to the palace,\u201d she joked at one point. Meghan also said she never received guidance on the formalities of the role. \u201cUnlike what you see in the movies, there\u2019s no class on how to speak, how to cross your legs, how to be royal,\u201d she said, describing how she would Google the words of the British national anthem at night to avoid embarrassing the family.   Winfrey asked Harry whether they quit as working members of the royal family because they were asking for help and couldn\u2019t get it. \u201cYeah, basically,\u201d Harry said. But the pair insisted they \u201cnever left\u201d the family, and merely stepped back from their official roles. \u201cLack of support and lack of understanding\u201d was the simplest reason they left, he said. But the prince hit back at stories last year that they blindsided the Queen by not telling her of their plan until it was public. \u201cI\u2019ve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,\u201d Harry said. Asked where that report came from, he said: \u201cIt probably could have come from within the institution.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t working for everyone,\u201d Meghan recalled telling the royals. \u201cMy biggest concern was history repeating itself,\u201d Harry said, adding that he saw the circumstances that affected his mother, Diana, unfolding again \u2014 but more dangerously, given that racism and social media added to their challenges. The pair said they suggested moving to a Commonwealth country and continuing to support the monarchy where needed, but they ultimately settled in the US after their security was removed. \u201cI got confirmation that no, the risk hadn\u2019t changed,\u201d Harry said, but given their change in status their protective detail would be revoked regardless. The issue of who would provide the couple\u2019s security was heavily covered in the media at the time, and the couple made clear that it was a decisive factor in their decision to move from Canada, where they stayed temporary, to California.   Few senior members of the royal family were portrayed positively in the interview, but the Queen was the exception. Harry said the pair have spoken to the monarch several times since their move to the US, and also informed her of their decision to step down as working royals. \u201cMy grandmother and I have a really good relationship, and an understanding and I have a deep respect for her,\u201d he said. But he admitted his relationships with his brother, Prince Wiliam, and his father, Prince Charles, are far more strained. \u201cI had three conversations with my grandmother and two conversations with my father, before he stopped taking my calls,\u201d Harry said, recalling the events surrounding their decision to leave last year. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to work through there. I feel really let down, because he\u2019s been something similar \u2014 he knows what pain feels like, and Archie\u2019s his grandson. \u201cBut at the same time, of course, I will always love him,\u201d Harry said, adding that repairing the relationship was one of his priorities. He also hinted that he attempted to reveal to his family the constraints of royal life that he had discovered. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to educate them,\u201d he said. Asked why Charles was not answering the phone, Harry suggested it was because he \u201ctook matters into my own hands.\u201d Turning to his brother, Harry said: \u201cI love William to bits, he\u2019s my brother, we\u2019ve been through hell together \u2026 but we\u2019re on different paths.\u201d He added that \u201cthe relationship is space at the moment,\u201d and that \u201ctime heals all things \u2014 hopefully.\u201d \u201cMy family literally cut me off financially\u201d in the first quarter of 2020, he added \u2014 a move that necessitated their lucrative media deals with Netflix and Spotify.   Winfrey presented Meghan with a series of headlines about her in the British media, contrasting them with far more positive stories about her sister-in-law Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. In one example, Winfrey read a story about her eating avocados which said the fruit was \u201clinked to water shortages, illegal deforestation and environmental devastation\u201d \u2014 while a separate story simply reported Kate was eating them to help with morning sickness. \u201cThat\u2019s a really loaded piece of toast,\u201d Meghan responded, admitting she saw the story. The pair both took aim at the British press in the interview, as they have done on several occasions before. And Harry said the palace is in \u201cfear\u201d of its media coverage, meaning they had little freedom while part of the family. \u201cTo simplify it, it\u2019s a case of if you as a family member are willing to wine, dine and give full access to these reporters, then you will get better press,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhy do you care about better press if you\u2019re royal?\u201d Winfrey asked. \u201cI think everyone needs to have some compassion for them in that situation \u2026 there is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations,\u201d Harry replied. But the racial undertones of some coverage made it more than \u201ccatty gossip,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt was bringing out a part of people that was racist and how it was charged \u2026 and that changed the threat, that changed the level of death threats, that changed everything.\u201d   Meghan was asked about stories in the British media that she made her sister-in-law cry while preparing for her wedding with Harry. Those stories were heavily covered in many tabloids, and were emblematic of media accusations about Meghan\u2019s behavior to royals and staff. But the reality was \u201cthe reverse,\u201d Meghan said \u2014 Kate made Meghan cry during a discussion about the ceremony, and months later the incorrect story appeared in the media. Meghan said Kate gave her flowers and apologized, and that she forgave her, adding that \u201cshe is a good person.\u201d But she said the reporting of the incident was a \u201cturning point\u201d in their experience. \u201cIf you love her you don\u2019t have to hate me,\u201d Meghan said, urging people not to pit the two duchesses against each other.   Segments of the broadcast, in which Winfrey toured the couple\u2019s home, were filmed hours after Prince Philip was admitted to a hospital last month. \u201cThis morning I woke up earlier than H and saw a note from someone in our team in the UK, saying that the Duke of Edinburgh had gone to hospital,\u201d Meghan told Winfrey. \u201cI just picked up the phone and I called the Queen, just to check in,\u201d she said, adding that the ability to do so freely would not have existed in the royal set-up. The 99-year-old husband of the Queen has spent three weeks in hospital and has undergone a heart procedure.   Meghan said her one regret is \u201cbelieving them when they said I would be protected.\u201d \u201cNow because we\u2019re actually on the other side, we\u2019ve actually not just survived but are thriving,\u201d Meghan added, comparing the couple\u2019s situation today with their time as working royals. Harry added that he does not feel any regrets about the way they left. \u201cI am really proud of us,\u201d he said. \u201cI am so proud of my wife. She safely delivered Archie during a period of time that was so cruel, so mean.\u201d   The couple revealed that their second child will be a girl. \u201cAmazing, just grateful,\u201d Harry said, describing his feelings. \u201cTo have any child, any one or any two, would have been amazing. But to have a boy and then a girl, what more could you ask for?\u201d he said. But they will not be trying to become parents for a third time. \u201cTwo is it,\u201d Meghan said, adding their daughter is due in the summer. The pair revealed in February that they were expecting another child. In November, Meghan revealed she suffered a miscarriage last year.   Harry said that having outdoor space has been a huge benefit during lockdowns in California, where they moved shortly before the pandemic began. Taking Archie outside is his favorite activity, he said. \u201cThe highlight for me is sticking him on the back of the bicycle\u201d \u2014 something he was never able to enjoy himself as a child. \u201cHydrate\u201d was Archie\u2019s recent favorite word, Meghan said. She wrapped up the interview by describing their lives today as \u201cgreater than any fairytale you\u2019ve ever read.\u201d CNN has reached out to the royal family for comment.

The project will use the natural flow of the\u00a0Cortaderal\u00a0and Las\u00a0Le\u00f1as\u00a0rivers to generate renewable energy, mainly through the use of tunnels.\u00a0Nido\u00a0de\u00a0\u00c1guila\u00a0is expected to have an installed capacity of 172 megawatts, enough clean electricity to supply approximately 450,000 Chilean homes. This is the second project that PHC will develop and deliver in the\u00a0Cachapoal\u00a0Valley, building on the successful completion of the\u00a0Chacayes\u00a0hydro power plant. Preliminary project plans feature two intakes connected by a power tunnel to an underground powerhouse, reducing potential environmental impacts and risks associated with a facility in a high area of the Andes Mountains. The underground powerhouse will be equipped with two turbines. The proposed tunnel alignment comprises an approximately 11-kilometer-long (7 mi) headrace tunnel that passes under a maximum of 1,300 meters (4,265\u00a0ft) of rock cover. The key concern of the alignment is the potential for overstress along the nearly 4-kilometer (2.5 mi) central section of high cover, where granitic rock of variable strength is anticipated. Because the overstressing potential represented a high risk to the construction schedule, PHC retained McMillen Jacobs Associates to perform a project review to consider alternative layouts for the project and to help develop a cost-benefit comparison of viable alternatives.

The information was reported last week by the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA). \u201cThe test results for maize imported from Uganda and Tanzania have revealed high levels of mycotoxins that are consistently beyond safety limits,\u201d explained Kello Harsama, Head of the AFA. The official said Mycotoxins, especially aflatoxins and fumonisins, are known to be carcinogenic. Over the years, many cases of acute and chronic aflatoxin-related diseases have been recorded in Kenya, including deaths. The decision is expected to impact not only relations between Kenya and its two partners but also trade in the East African region. Due to its low domestic production, Kenya depends on Tanzania and Uganda to meet the needs of its population. Kello Harsama reassured that Kenya remains committed to facilitating secure trade with its partners and will seek to work closely with stakeholders to address this issue. Last September, the Kenyan authorities announced new measures to lower the cost of maize production in the country and support local producers. However, local production remains low, and a suspension of imports could push up the prices of this staple food, which is widely consumed in the country. This situation is likely to be difficult to maintain, in a tense social context aggravated by the health crisis.

This week's column is by Meghan Marsac, Ph.D., a pediatric psychologist at Kentucky Children\u2019s Hospital.  LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 8, 2021) \u2013 Returning to school will bring out different feelings in different kids. Some might be very excited and others quite nervous. Many will likely have mixed feelings.\u00a0Some kids might be nervous about seeing their classmates or teachers, especially if your family has had very limited contact with others over the past year.\u00a0 It might take some time for kids to get used to new rules or expectations at school.\u00a0The workload might change, which can take time to adjust to.\u00a0The distractions will be different and there will be longer periods of instruction, more than what your child might have become accustomed to. Here are some tips to promote adjustment as your child settles back into their in-person learning routine: Things to watch out for: Keep in contact with your child\u2019s teacher; they may be seeing behavior in your child that you don\u2019t see at home. If you are worried about anything that seems different or off in your child, reach out to your pediatrician, school counselor or a behavioral health provider. \u00a0 The University of Kentucky is increasingly the first choice for students, faculty and staff to pursue their passions and their professional goals. In the last two years, Forbes has named UK among the best employers for diversity, and INSIGHT into Diversity recognized us as a Diversity Champion four years running.\u00a0UK is ranked among the top 30 campuses in the nation for LGBTQ* inclusion and safety. UK has been judged a \u201cGreat College to Work for\" three\u00a0years in a row, and UK is among only 22 universities in the country on Forbes' list of \"America's Best Employers.\"\u00a0 We are ranked among the top 10 percent of public institutions for research expenditures \u2014\u00a0a tangible symbol of our breadth and depth as a university focused on discovery that changes lives and communities. And our patients know and appreciate the fact that UK HealthCare has been named the state\u2019s top hospital for five straight years. Accolades and honors are great. But they are more important for what they represent: the idea that creating a community of belonging and commitment to excellence is how we honor our mission to be not simply the University of Kentucky, but the University\u00a0for\u00a0Kentucky."

In addition, Alexis was the Governor's lead representative on international affairs and served as Chief of Protocol.  Before joining the Brown Administration, Alexis worked for Pacific Gas & Electric in Government Affairs. Prior to joining that utility, she spent nearly a decade in Washington, D.C., working first as the Director of Scheduling for U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California), and then as the Manager of Government Relations for The Walt Disney Company.  Most recently, Alexis was appointed by Governor Newsom to serve on the State Compensation Insurance Fund Board of Directors.

            "text": " Restaurants, concert venues and airplane manufacturers all stand to benefit from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package the Senate just approved. They are among the few industries that won targeted help in the massive spending bill. Unlike its predecessor - the $2 trillion Cares Act, which proved a smorgasbord for corporate interests - the latest installment of federal aid focuses on funding state and local governments and schools and extra support for individuals. Lawmakers snubbed a wide array of businesses pleading for help from Washington. Gym operators and long-term senior care facilities are among those arguing Congress has left them facing further closures and layoffs even as the broader economic outlook brightens. \"When you see restaurants continuing to get financial relief, and yet those on the front lines of caring for the most vulnerable in this crisis are left out, I struggle with that,\" said James Balda, president of Argentum, an association representing companies that run senior-living facilities. His group unsuccessfully pushed for $5 billion in federal aid for the sector. \"The hope is by spring and early summer, things will have started to normalize, so businesses won't need a ton more aid,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The bill, he said, \"reflects a shift toward focusing on making sure households and state and local governments are in good shape, rather than specific industries or the business sector broadly.\" Against that backdrop, the handful of interests that secured billions of dollars in new funding stand out. The restaurant industry emerged as the bill's biggest private-sector winner. The package establishes a $25 billion \"revitalization fund\" for restaurants that will dole out grants to help them cover pandemic-related revenue losses, with businesses eligible for up to $5 million each. Sean Kennedy, the National Restaurant Association's vice president for public affairs, called the fund the \"the culmination of a one-year effort\" to secure a dedicated pot of money for the sector. But it has racked up a series of smaller lobbying victories in pandemic relief measures, including a carve-out in the Payroll Protection Program that granted restaurants a higher loan limit than other businesses. In the latest bill, the restaurant group helped push for the expansion of a tax credit for companies that keep workers on their payrolls. And they lobbied against a federal minimum wage increase many Democrats wanted to include, endorsing the package once they were confident it would not include such a hike or end the tipped minimum wage. Kennedy said restaurants deserve the special attention. \"No industry has lost more jobs and more revenue than restaurants,\" he said, pegging the sector's revenue losses at $255 billion. \"We were the first industry to be shut down, we'll be the last to reopen, and we have a very long road to recovery in front of us.\" The restaurant lobby activated its nationwide grass-roots network to push for final passage of the package, calling on restaurateurs to press their own lawmakers on the urgency of the need for aid. \"Every member of Congress has their favorite place when they get home from Washington,\" Kennedy said. \"Communities of every size have lost a beloved restaurant. Members see that, and we work off of that.\" Those operating music clubs and other event venues made a similar pitch and secured $1.25 billion in grant money in the bill. That adds to $15 billion the sector landed in the $900 billion relief package approved in December. But venue operators say they haven't received any of the federal money yet, as the Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, hasn't established guidelines or an application process. \"We understand there's a need to get this done right, and we're in complete agreement with that,\" said Audrey Fix Schaefer, communications director for the National Independent Venues Association. \"But this was an emergency eight months ago. It's even more dire now, and people cannot wait.\" The pandemic put the sector through a crash course in Washington influence. Previously, venue operators had no national association. A number of them formed the group at the beginning of the pandemic to lobby for federal relief, and the association now includes 3,000 members, with at least one in every state, Schaefer said. It shelled out $240,000 to hire a 10-person lobbying team from the firm Akin Gump, including former aides to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., lobbying disclosures show. The group launched the \"Save Our Stages\" campaign and generated more than 2 million emails to lawmakers pressing them to back federal aid, according to Schaefer. Scores of famous artists joined the cause. Last month, Dolly Parton added her voice. \"You know, attending live concerts is not an option right now, and many of our neighborhood independent venues, like the places I got my start, are at risk of closing forever,\" she said in a video, directing viewers to the group's website. The industry has won high-profile support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., emerged as a vocal champion - and a conspicuous one, appearing in the halls of the Capitol and the streets of New York City sporting a \"Save Our Stages\" face mask. But Schaefer said the industry remains in worse shape than restaurants, which in many cases have maintained some revenue by offering delivery, takeout and outdoor dining. And she said the sector faces a more uncertain timeline for getting back on its feet, because performers will need to be able to travel - and getting those acts booked and promoted \"will probably take another three to five months.\" Gym and fitness studio operators have their own argument to make for the acuteness of their need. They argue that because their facilities have faced the same restrictions as restaurants and event venues, with similar economic fallout for their owners and workers, they should likewise get a dedicated federal aid program. \"Gyms were listed among the first to close and the last to reopen,\" said Brett Ewer, the top lobbyist for CrossFit. He said roughly a fifth of U.S. gyms closed permanently last year. \"Exercise and physical activity are such a fundamental good. We need places for people to engage in this activity in a communal way.\" The industry formed a coalition in October and has rallied behind a bipartisan bill, sponsored by Reps. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., that would provide $30 billion. But it was not included in the broader relief package. Aviation manufacturers fared better, in part by appealing to lawmakers from areas that are home to heavy concentrations of aviation and aerospace companies, including Washington, Kansas, and Virginia. An array of lobbying groups for the industry joined with unions representing their workers to ask for $15 billion that would fund a payroll support program, with the industry bearing half the cost. Lawmakers trimmed that sum to $3 billion and cut the length of the program from a year to six months. \"The bigger the better for helping, but we'll take what we can get,\" said Pete Bunce, president of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. \"Whatever they give us will be used to make sure the supply chain is secure as we come into the vaccination period.\" The package also includes funding for a handful of educational institutions. Howard University, Vice President Kamala Harris's alma mater, nailed down $35 million, on top of $33 million it received from earlier pandemic bills; and Gallaudet University in D.C. and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf will get $19.25 million each, after each landed $11 million in the December relief bill. The schools are all federally chartered, and the money for Howard, which gets direct congressional funding every year, ensures it won't need to draw on other aid provided for historically Black colleges and universities, according to an aide for the House Education and Labor Committee. The money for Gallaudet and the institute are meant to help the broader deaf community those schools support beyond their immediate populations, the aide said.

The bridge was severely damaged following the collapse of the Matthieu Dam in July 2011 and the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China funded its reconstruction.  The bridge project commenced in 2016 headed by China Railway 14th Bureau Group Corporation Limited and was scheduled to be completed in September 2017, but was delayed due to Hurricane Maria.  Project Manager for the China Railway 14th Bureau Group Corporation Ltd, Xiangping Fan said while the passage of Hurricane Maria, hindered their progress, it did not affect the quality of their work. \u201cThe newly constructed bridge stood. This is a true testimony of the quality of work that the China Railway 14 is known for,\u201d he said adding that it is ready to withstand the elements.  He said the Company is pleased to hand over the bridge which will serve the people of Layou and by extension the entire country.  \u201cMay it not only serve as a passage to the other side of the river but may it serve as a connection to each and every Dominican\u2026 the Yorke Valley project is a wonderful beginning.\u201d This bridge he said symbolizes the deep friendship between the two countries in the face of difficulties and disasters.  Meanwhile, Parliamentary Representative for Layou, Kelver Darroux said this bridge is a very important project for the communities within his constituency and the entire island by extension.  \u201cI say that because over the last few years of construction of the Yorke Valley Bridge we\u2019ve had tremendous support from the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for one being a significant partner towards the development of this bridge and also for standing with us through very difficult times.\u201d Darroux expressed gratitude to the Chinese Ambassador and Government for their continued support.

            "text": " Keegan McBride first came to Estonia in 2013 to study at the University of Tartu and in 2015, moved back permanently to Estonia where he completed his doctoral studies at Tallinn University of Technology\u2019s Public Administration programme in 2020. Keegan has played an active role in disseminating information about the COVID-19 pandemic in Estonia since the beginning, due to his work with the Estonian open data portal, his management of koroonakaart.ee (an information portal that provided multilingual real-time data on the coronavirus in Estonia), and more recently piirangud.ee (a site that maintains up-to-date information on the current restrictions in Estonia). As an international expert on bureaucracy and public administration, McBride offers a sharp and neutral assessment on the Estonian government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country where the situation is now getting worse day-by-day. According to the Estonian Health Board statistics on 7 March, in the previous 24 hours, the country added 1,321 new coronavirus cases. The infection rate in the preceding 14 days per 100,000 inhabitants was 1,309.05. The Reuters coronavirus tracker says new infections in Estonia are at their peak and that there have been 75,003 infections and 653 coronavirus-related deaths reported in the country since the pandemic began. At the same time, the country is dragging its feet with the vaccination against the virus. So far, only 43,942 people in Estonia have received both doses of the vaccine \u2013 that is 3.3% of the population. A little over 100,000 people have received at least one dose \u2013 and even that is just 7.633% of the Estonian population. In an interview with Estonian World, McBride says the vaccines and the pandemic have become a political game, used to attack and score political points. McBride highlights serious managerial and organisational issues at the Estonian social affairs\u2019 ministry. Because of the public sector cuts, Estonia\u2019s usually much praised digital state has underdelivered too. He says also the current government, headed by Kaja Kallas and her Reform Party, is hypocritical, making the same mistakes they criticised the previous government for. McBride indicates that if the government doesn\u2019t do more now to solve the crisis, the situation in Estonia will get a whole lot worse. Keegan McBride, the Estonian government has said on multiple occasions that nobody could have seen this coming, and that the restrictions currently in force are as strict as they were last year. Is this true? Is this true, certainly not. Either the government actually believes this to be true, in which case they would be incompetent \u2013 or they know this is not true, and they are saying it anyway, which is disturbing.\u00a0 The fact is that in the end of 2020, it was abundantly clear that the pandemic was getting worse, and that it had the possibility to spiral out of control quickly. To be clear, the blame for this cannot be placed completely on the head of the new government (Kaja Kallas \u2013 editor), but the blame must be shared \u2013 and a larger part of it likely lies with the previous government. Let\u2019s look at what we do know. On 8 December, Krista Fischer (Estonian mathematician and a member of the science council advising the government on the crisis), said on her Facebook page that the government\u2019s restrictions did not go far enough. Instead of listening, the then-prime minister, J\u00fcri Ratas, scolded the scientist. On 23 December, Fischer once again warned that if restrictions were not tightened, February would be critical for the Estonian health-care system.  Tanel Tenson, the scientist running the COVID-19 sewage water surveys, highlighted in December that the virus had made its way across Estonia, and in January, the levels would be increasing rapidly. He too sounded a warning that things were going to get worse. The message from scientists across the board was clear \u2013 if more restrictions were not put in place, a disaster was coming to Estonia. At the same time, as the situation was deteriorating in Estonia, its southern neighbours Latvia and Lithuania were in a health-care system crisis, their hospitals were overburdened. The future for Estonia was clear to anyone who looked next door. While all of this was happening, news came from the UK that a new variant of the virus was spreading that was more contagious \u2013 the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warned governments to be prepared for it. Indeed, all throughout January scientists directly involved in the study of COVID-19, as well as those who followed the statistics for their own interest, saw what was coming. So, to say that no one saw this coming is simply irresponsible and not in line with reality. This takes us to the second part of the question, are the restrictions in place now the same as they were in the first emergency situation, in spring 2020? Here, too, the facts are not in agreement with the government\u2019s argument.\u00a0 To see this clearly, we can turn to Oxford\u2019s stringency index, which measures government policy responses to COVID-19. As can be seen from the index, in the early stages of the crisis, Estonia had a high policy response, above both Latvia and Lithuania. But during the second wave of the crisis, we have the lowest response of the four countries, with decreases in restrictions preceding the rapid growth of COVID-19 in Estonia in early February. So, once again, to argue that things are as strict as they were before is disturbing.\u00a0 The science council is calling for tightening of restrictions \u2013 and yet the restrictions do not follow. Does the government have a handle on the current COVID-19 situation? What we know is that there is a lag effect with COVID-19. It is only later that hospitalisations and deaths start to rise. Changes and restrictions that come into effect, won\u2019t make their impact known for weeks into the future.\u00a0 The fact is that today \u2013 and this has been said publicly by the director of the Estonian Health Board, \u00dcllar Lanno, as well \u2013 the health board has lost control. In some areas we are not able to contact trace.\u00a0 While the WHO recommends the percentage of positive tests remains below 10%, Estonia\u2019s average over the past two weeks has been around 16%, with many days having 20% of tests returning positive. In practice, this means that the true percentage of positive cases inside Estonia is a large degree higher than the 1,500 positive cases per day we are seeing now.\u00a0 The solution would be to test more, but we cannot \u2013 Estonia appears to be have reached or at least neared the top of its testing capacity. Our hospitals are overrun, and in Tallinn, ambulances are running every 20 minutes with a COVID-19 patient (Tallinn\u2019s ambulance service\u2019s chief doctor, Raul Adlas, said on 6 March that the service had been working at full capacity for the past couple of weeks and around half of calls lead to a patient having to be hospitalised immediately \u2013 editor). This is the situation the public sees \u2013 and it is frightening. One thing is clear, there are serious managerial and organisational issues at the ministry of social affairs. These issues are not of the type that would appear within a matter of days, weeks or months \u2013 and responsibility for them cannot be fully placed on the minister (the minister of health and labour, Tanel Kiik, Centre Party \u2013 editor) \u2013 but rather lies at the counsellor level and is managerial in nature. Some names that are often being voiced as playing a role in the serious mishandling of this crisis are \u00dcllar Lanno, Maris Jesse (the deputy secretary general on health at the ministry) and Marika Priske (the secretary general at the ministry ). These weaknesses and lack of preparedness are not new. For years, the National Audit Office of Estonia has been highlighting the lack of preparedness by the ministry and its agencies for a crisis. Academic theses have been written about this. The Estonian Health Board has failed numerous emergency and crisis simulations. The fact that these organisations have faltered is not surprising.\u00a0 However, I would like to point out that the blame for this cannot and must not be directed at the employees of the ministry. Devoted civil servants have worked \u2013 and continue to work \u2013 tirelessly at fighting this pandemic to the best of their ability with the tools they have. The fact they have been constrained by poor managerial practices is unsettling.\u00a0 How does this influence Estonia\u2019s lacklustre performance with vaccines to date? When it comes to vaccination in Estonia, there are two issues at play. One is that you need to have vaccines available, and this has so far been dictated by the terms of the European Union\u2019s joint procurement. The second is the logistics and roll out of vaccinations.\u00a0 When it comes to obtaining vaccinations, the government has shown itself to be hesitant to express any form of innovation or proactivity. It is easier for the government to not act proactively \u2013 trying to obtain vaccines by other means \u2013 as any attempts that fail could carry political risks. If they continue down the current path, it is always possible to blame the EU for the lack of vaccines being available. While Kaja Kallas was in the opposition, she repeatedly highlighted the need for innovation and called for every attempt to be exhausted to obtain vaccines \u2013 yet, now as PM, one can certainly not say this has been done. Vaccination in Estonia has become part of the political mathematics, and Estonian lives are the cost; this is unacceptable. Regarding the logistics, there has been a number of issues at play. First, regulation and data protection have put a serious damper on the compilation of risk group lists and vaccination schedules. A large amount of regulation and legislation has slowed down the process. These issues had remained hidden from the public eye, but have recently begun to be reported in the press.\u00a0 Another issue is related to communication. Recent surveys have shown that the number one reason Estonians are hesitant or refusing to get vaccinated is due to a lack of information. In fact, this is a fair criticism of the government\u2019s COVID-19 response across the board \u2013 communication has been, and continues to be, poorly conducted. From lack of awareness about vaccines, to poor communication of the current restrictions in place, to providing information to all residents and citizens of Estonia \u2013 almost no communication plan has gone well, or even existed.\u00a0 There are other issues related to the roll out of the vaccine such as requiring nurses to act as sales agents; calling individuals and asking them to come for a vaccination, instead of allowing them to pre-register. Some family doctors\u2019 offices have received many vaccines, while some have requested none.\u00a0 When doses are going to go to waste because people do not show up, there is no official waiting list for those who wish to get vaccinated to receive such doses instead. If a large number of vaccines did become available, it is not yet clear how Estonia would engage in any sort of mass vaccination programme. I hope such a plan does exist, but the government has not communicated this yet.\u00a0 Last year, when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, we were seeing stories in global outlets, created by journalists in London, New York and elsewhere, as if Estonia was handling the crisis better than other countries, thanks to its digital state. Was it actually so? I have written extensively about this, and it has caused many friends and colleagues to scorn me, but the fact is the digital state has not performed as well as one would have hoped during this time of crisis.\u00a0 Yes, some parts of the e-state (a digital state, or in Estonia, also dubbed e-Estonia \u2013 editor) worked phenomenally. A clear example of this is the amazing work that TEHIK (the Estonian Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre) has done to make data available in an open format \u2013 Estonia is probably a leader when it comes to making COVID-19 data available. But, in many other regards, the e-state did not help.\u00a0 The primary reason for this is that digital tools cannot be a replacement for experience, capacity, and capability. The public sector in Estonia has suffered for a year from underfunding and job cuts that have severely limited its ability to perform as it needs to \u2013 but the idea of expanding the state is not popular here, so the trend continues.\u00a0 The lack of funding for digital government has been clear for years and its effects are noticeable during this pandemic. Small and devoted teams of public servants in ministerial IT offices must simultaneously maintain legacy infrastructure, procure new services and develop innovation with less people and less money than before. This obviously translates to a decrease in performance. In the summer of 2020, the ministry of social affairs launched a coronavirus close contact notification app called \u201cHOIA\u201d. Estonian newspaper Postimees recently reported that the app had not managed to reach its potential in terms of helping contain the virus. What could have gone possibly wrong? The HOIA application started off as a good idea, but quickly faltered. This application was built as a pro bono cooperation between a number of Estonian IT companies. The project manager was based at TEHIK, but once the project was completed, the employee left to a new position. That left the ownership of the application in unsure hands.\u00a0 Several shortcomings quickly became clear. First, from the government perspective, they could not get actionable statistics from the app (this was a design choice and made with privacy in mind). Second, there likely is not enough smart phone users in Estonia for this app to reach the penetration level needed for it to become highly useful. Third, it is not compatible with the EU\u2019s interoperability framework for such applications. There were a number of other issues with the app, which led to a procurement being offered for the improvement and maintenance of HOIA. The first procurement failed. A new procurement has been prepared, but progresses slowly.\u00a0 All signs seem to point that this app will have had minimal impact, cost a large amount of money, and not be ready by the time the pandemic begins to lull, at which point it may not even be needed. Estonia is currently second in Europe in terms of new coronavirus infections. What the previous and the new government could have done differently to avoid this ever-concerning situation? The government needs to listen to its scientists and prioritise the health and wellbeing of its citizens over politics. If they do that, they will be already on the right path. Debating a balanced budget and discussing spending, while hundreds of citizens are in hospitals and tens are dying every day, is a disservice to Estonia. Tanel Kiik, the current minister of health and labour, was also in the same position in the Ratas\u2019 government \u2013 he is at least partly responsible for the decisions made in the ministry of social affairs since the pandemic started in early 2020. Should he take the responsibility for the blunders? As I said previously, there are serious managerial and organisational issues at the ministry of social affairs, but these predate Tanel Kiik. So, while he certainly needs to shoulder some of the blame, it must not fall on him alone.  However, he should make a clear and public effort to outline what these shortcomings have been so far and offer concrete solutions and paths forward in overcoming them.\u00a0 Should the government offer more financial support to businesses that suffer economically due to the crisis? Now is not the time to debate budgets, the government must ensure it takes care of its businesses and citizens, the cost of doing otherwise is too great. What do you think should be the government\u2019s action plan now, considering the critical COVID-19 situation in Estonia?\u00a0 The government struggles with communication and this leaves the population in a state of confusion. Without clear communication, it is hard to understand what the government is doing. This must be improved, moving forward.\u00a0 Second, the government needs to acknowledge the reality of the situation we are in. It is already bad. They have not added many new restrictions that are likely to be effective. This means that in the next month and forward, it is going to get worse.\u00a0 Now is not the time for politics and indecisiveness. Hard decisions need to be made and they need to be made now \u2013 every day we wait makes the future recovery harder. \u00dcllar Lanno has said that if we constantly have 1,500 to 1,600 positive cases each day, then we must lock down the country \u2013 we are already there and past it.\u00a0 The government knows what needs to be done; the question is whether they have the will to put country over politics. I hope they do. Please note that the Estonian government imposed new restrictions on the evening of 8 March.

SOUTHINGTON \u2014 A Utah man was driving under the influence when he went the wrong way on a Connecticut highway and hit and dragged a state trooper, according to police. Michael Newman, 35, of Salt Lake City, was charged with reckless driving, illegal operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol/drugs, driving the wrong way on a divided highway, first-degree criminal mischief, assault on a public safety officer and first-degree reckless endangerment. Around 2:10 a.m. Saturday, Connecticut State Police troopers were dispatched to the area of Interstate 84 west in the area of Exit 32 for a report that a wrong-way driver had gone off the roadway, according to a state police report. Troopers and Southington officers shut down the highway. As troopers arrived, they found the driver \u2014 later identified as Newman \u2014 \u201cdriving in circles on I-84,\u201d state police said. When Newman stopped, he was facing the wrong way, the report said. Once he was stopped, a trooper tried to get Newman out of the car. State police said instead Newman drove off, dragging the trooper. State police said the trooper was not injured. The troopers tried to box Newman\u2019s car in. State police said Newman intentionally hit one of the cruisers before he crossed to the eastbound lanes, then back over to westbound, \u201cin an attempt to escape arrest.\u201d When Newman was stopped at another point, state police said the use of a Taser was attempted, but didn\u2019t make contact. Newman was eventually stopped just east of the Exit 32 on-ramp and was taken into custody. State police said his vehicle sustained disabling front-end damage. Newman, described by police as \u201ccombative,\u201d was taken to the state police barracks to be processed on the charges.

Any submissions made on our comment section, are solely the views of the individual and not Barbados Today. I would also look at the countries that did the same to get their feedback as well. Just don\u2019t jump off the deep end without due diligence Barbados will end up just like Jamaica if they don\u2019t stay away from China. Nope The Chinese expanding their territory into the Caribbean using gullible Caribbean ministers of government. Don\u2019t do it Barbados would end up just like rest Once you let them in prepare for some challenges and disenfranchised Bajans. Why don\u2019t Barbados keep away from these people we don\u2019t want it U all see whts going on with trump and the fake goods u all sick There is a price to pay for this assistance. Example , Canada arrested an person charged by the USA in accordance with their legal obligation. China arrested two persons and charged with espionage, and stopped buying some agricultural products. The Chinese government retaliates, what happens if in the UN if Barbados does not vote the way the Chinese would like them to? Just saying be careful of whose bed you are sleeping in. Smh Can we be colonized by someone who will ACTUALLY feed us this time? Like hell it will we don\u2019t watch those people taking over look at Africa and Jamaica keep them to hell out. I truly oppose getting into business with the Chinese. Do not take no business or assistance from the Chinese. No to the Chinese These demonic people hates black people why would you wanna do business with them? These peeps are fake and you will be they slaves. Caveat emptor \u2026.\nLet the buyer beware. The Chinese will benefit from business in Barbados and establish ownership and control as they have in Africa and Jamaica. Always keep in mind the saga of some African nations and Jamaica. All that glitters is not gold! Do not fall prey to the chinese. Look at belize, jamaica, african countries. They come and give you huge loans that they know you cant pay off and take all your prize assets from the people. China is over populated, they need some place to put there people. They come to the caribbean because most caribbean countries are majority poor and in need. They exploit you and take all your fertile land and prize assets. There is NO benefit Do not get into bed with China.   The only benefits will be dor the Chinese.   Just look at what is happening in Certain African countries and Jamaica.  Barbados or Bajans will not benefit. Why does everyone feel that they have to reinvent the wheel. Have we not learnt from the examples of others? No please. Ask Antigua why Go ahead!!! But be warned\u2026..you take soldier man things, be prepared to take soldier man licks\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t this be a case off closing the stable door after the horse already bolted? Who built the gymnasium, along with other projects? These money grabbing, hand to mouth, greedy, corrupt politicians we\u2019ve bout here will keep selling Barbados until there\u2019s nothing left to sell, and then born and bred Bajans will be asked to leave or exported to someplace like Haiti. I am in total agreement with all of these comments. Be very careful of these trojan horses\u2026 Folks need to start writing and calling ministers because they need to know Bajans do not support this. Anyone with any sense following the global economy would know this is a horrible idea. Chinese money come with strings and they come to take over He more thing change the\u2026.. Don\u2019t do it HOW? What does Barbados has to offer China? Bright Red Flag!! If Barbados want to remain Bajan. Keep the Chinese out of Barbados. Just look at the effect that the Chinese has had on Jamaica and Africa. China is looking for colonies for its ever increasing population. The Chinese are the new Europeans. Don\u2019t ever forget the colonial carve up of Africa. Minister of Small Business, Entrepreneurship and Commerce, Dwight Sutherland listen to the majority cause I don\u2019t know any place besides  here. It might sound good to you and you and you. But think carefully about what you are doing. The final decision is not yours. Listen! Not a good idea at all Dwight everthing bout them is fake cheap and nah good I hope he know what he doing those ppl fake,everything about them Chinese fake, if you cant trust them to cook food for you what make u think you can trust them with Barbados. Remove the from and what wdo we have? Yeah! right! delusional!! The Chinese here long time ago You got that right, they are slowly taking over countries, when  you borrow their money  and cannot repay Wunnahg gine soon find d out Oh my word. Run Forest run. Is there any place on earth that the Chinese are not trying to take over ? Apparently even a 21 x 14 island is not too small for them. This politician got his head stuck in the sand at every beach on the island. Please do not do anymore deals with China! Barbados will be beholden to this parasite.\nI am wanting to buy a home in Barbados and retire there with my family. Now\u2026I am waiting to see the Bajan government stand up and say \u2018no more\u2019!\nI do not want to be under tyrannical Chinese rule and I know it is coming. China needs to be told NO. For all of Trumps faults, at least he has the balls to say NO more Chinese investing in the USA. I do feel it is too late there as well. They own cities and huge masses of farmland, large corporations as well. It will all end badly. They do NOT care about the ecosystems of any land. Beware! Your email address will not be published.

            "text": "  Power to Peru    An enormous new dam has been constructed in Peru, where the Huallaga River flows through a narrow, V-shaped gorge. At a height of 676 feet (206 meters), this is one of the largest concrete-faced rockfill dams in the world. The 456 megawatts of generating capacity comprises approximately 13% of the country\u2019s total installed hydro capacity and will contribute around 6% of the total energy produced in Peru once the main plant is commissioned. The $1.2 billion project includes 21 miles (34 kilometers) of access roads, a reservoir 11 miles (17.3 kilometers) long and more than 14 miles (23 kilometers) of tunnels up to 39 feet (12 meters) in diameter. A 450-megawatt main powerhouse contains two generating units, and a separate powerhouse contains a single 6-megawatt unit for passing the environmental flow. The project\u2019s sheer size and complexity, along with the dam type and topography, posed significant potential risks that needed clear identification and management to reassure lenders. Mott MacDonald reviewed technical, contractual and financial components to achieve successful financial close. We played a key role in assessing and mitigating project risks to ensure the project could progress through measures including modification of the spillway design to pass the probable maximum flood, undertaking a maximum probable loss analysis to inform project insurances, amending the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract to address bankability issues, and agreeing on a land acquisition plan to mitigate risks related to the transmission line. A panel of experts, appointed at our recommendation, scrutinized each stage of detailed design to identify risks, and an owner\u2019s engineer was appointed at our behest. We have performed routine (quarterly) site visits with an expert team of tunnel, dam and power plant specialists to review construction status and progress, identify and discuss risks, and review the implementation of risk mitigation activities. We also supported the lenders during the project\u2019s operations and maintenance phase. Construction of the facility at Chaglla is substantially complete. While the plant is yet to enter commercial service, evidence of the project\u2019s positive impacts is already being seen. Chaglla is bringing positive social impacts to the area. A training program called \"CREER\" was established to develop local skills capacity for the project. More than 1,500 local people have acquired masonry, carpentry, and driving skills at no cost to them. Overall, the project has created 2,500 direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs in the local town. The Chaglla access road has also had a major impact, improving local residents\u2019 access to health services, education, and trade. Travellng to the nearest main town previously took six hours on a substandard road, with no reliable public transport available. Now the journey takes one hour, and two local transport companies provide a public service on the new road. Choose how you'd like to visit mottmac.com Would you like to hear more from us?

            "text": " Bobby is a sixth grader at North Brookfield Elementary School in western Massachusetts. He's crazy about the Loch Ness monster. He's into math and Minecraft. And he likes online learning.\n \"It's a lot easier to focus,\" he says. \"I can be in my room and be a lot more comfortable doing stuff.\"\n President Biden has said that his goal is to have the majority of K-8 schools operating in-person by the end of his first 100 days in office.\n That's a welcome goal for the many parents who worry about their children falling behind while learning virtually during the coronavirus pandemic. But some are realizing that their children do better in online school. By most accounts, it's the case for students who focus better when they are not around classmates.\n Bobby has ADHD and sometimes gets seizures. (NPR isn't using last names to protect students' privacy.) This means that the 11-year-old often needs to take breaks from class, whether it is because of a seizure or just because he wants to walk around the room to get some of his energy out. Even though he already had some accommodations when school was in-person, online learning makes it easier for him to accommodate his own needs.\n Another benefit for Bobby is that all his assignments, readings and instructions are laid out on his computer. His mother, Tashena Holmes, says that's because Bobby used to get into trouble for missing assignments.\n \"Whereas with remote school, they usually send videos, so he can rewind it as much as he wants and all the information's right there so he can reread it,\" she says.\n Andrea Parrish, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins School of Education and the director of development and learning systems at the IDEALS institute, says some parents of children with autism have reported that their children also do well online.\n \"The social component is actually sort of taken out in a lot of ways,\" says Parrish, who works with students from vulnerable communities. \"There's not that expectation for face-to-face communication, so a lot of children enjoy it. They prefer it.\"\n Parrish also says that for children to succeed in online school, they usually need to be able to recognize their needs and self-regulate, such as Bobby knowing he needs to get up and walk around every so often.\n Some school districts are thinking about ways to accommodate such students when they return to in-person learning.\n The Sioux City Community School District in Iowa is starting a permanent online learning program in the fall, and up to 1,000 children \u2014 1 in 15 students \u2014 are expected to sign up for the first semester.\n \"There's a great deal of excitement about this as a new option, a new possibility, for learning,\" says the district's superintendent, Paul Gausman.\n Ava, 16, will be a senior next year and is one of the students signed up for the program. Like Bobby, she has ADHD and does better academically without the distractions of in-person schooling.\n \"Before virtual, when I was in-person, I had almost all F's, but now since virtual I have all A's,\" she says.\n Ava does miss her friends, but she and her family decided that her education is more important right now. And her family is incredibly proud of her.\n \"She's just flying, soaring above what we had even imagined was possible,\" says her mother, Candas Mackie. \n  Copyright 2021 NPR.

Digital Content Manager The US just added another powerful tool against Covid-19 to its inventory: a third vaccine. Teachers, school staff, and others involved in education are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the state of Georgia. The change comes after Governor Brian Kemp announced at the end of February he was expanding eligibility to the vaccine. The change in eligibility comes as vaccine supplies continue to increase across the nation, including in Georgia. Last week, Governor Kemp said the vaccine supply would increase to more than 200,000 doses when including the new one dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Educators now join the list of those eligible that includes people over 65, first responders, health care workers and staffers, and residents of long-term facilities. With so many now eligible, Kemp announced the state would be opening more mass vaccination sites. Additionally, the federal government announced Friday FEMA would be opening a mass vaccination site at Mercedes-Benz Stadium soon. Kemp will be touring the state-operated mass vaccination site in Clarkesville.

The Hilton\u2019s Starlight Luau is usually held outdoors, but because of the weather, it was moved to one of their ballrooms Friday. Based on the tier system, the Hilton\u2019s Starlight Luau followed city rules. The event fell into the category of \u201cdesignated businesses or operations, restaurants or other commercial attractions.\u201d But the rules are stirring confusion. One resident called the situation \u201cfrustrating.\u201d He had to postpone his wedding to June, and he\u2019s now asking for clarity on the guidelines since weddings currently fall into the \u201csocial gatherings\u201d category. \u201cI think for sure weddings are in a definite gray area especially for outdoor venues because it\u2019s a gathering, so what difference is a wedding gathering versus a luau?\u201d he asked. The city says the tier system guidelines related to health and safety require approval from the state. Hawaii News Now reached out to the state Department of Health for an explanation on the logic behind this portion of the tier system. DOH released this statement: \u201cA gathering of 150 people eating indoors is a bad idea.\u201d Mayor Rick Blangiardi said he plans to meet with DOH for clarification on this matter.

The bribes are now being paid to party members residing abroad, and will trickle into Barbados at the appropriate times. The new format for the Estimates where senior public servants are quizzed and provided information about their respective Ministries is a welcomed and refreshing change.  It gives the public a better understanding and appreciation of what actually go into how taxpayers monies are spent. Very enlightening, indeed. Typically Chinese companies carrying out projects like this overseas suck their money out of their government, then pull the plug on the deal. Only in Government; Layne is a lucky man. There is no excuse not to retain the previous figures of the amount of money owed to landowners whose properties were compulsorily acquired by Government. His purpose was to have this information at hand; in the future he should be prepared. His response defeated the purpose for the new format of the estimates. All this new format will show is that all the talk about \u201ctiefing\u201d DLP Ministers will come to nothing. It is the Civil Servants that controls the Government purse (and quite rightly so).

            "text": " \n\n\n\n Hydropower is a renewable energy source based on the natural water cycle. It is the most mature, reliable and cost-effective renewable power generation technology presently commercially viable on a large scale, producing around 16% of the world\u2019s electricity and over 80% of the world\u2019s renewable electricity. Hydropower has four major advantages: it is renewable, it produces negligible amounts of greenhouse gases, it is the least costly way of storing large amounts of energy, and it can easily adjust the amount of electrical energy produced to the amount demanded by consumers. More than 25 countries in the world depend on hydropower for 90% of their electricity supply (99.3 % in Norway), and 12 countries are 100% reliant on this form of renewable energy. Hosororo Hydropower Project    In 2015, the German Government, through its German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) initiative, committed to assisting the GEA with the rehabilitation of the Hosororo Hydropower facility in Region 1. The US$165,175 project received US$91,108 in financing from the Government of Guyana and US$74,067 in financing from GIZ/REETA. The resuscitated hydropower project featured a new design that was conceptualised by GEA\u2019s Engineers and a GIZ consultant (Sven Homscheid).\u00a0 It entails the installation of a 20kW run-of-the-river type micro hydropower plant, comprising of a Weir/Intake structure, Penstock and Powerhouse. . The construction of the micro hydropower plant was completed in 2018 and works related to interconnection with the Mabaruma electric grid is ongoing. The plant is expected to be commission in 2019. Hydro Power Consultation Presentation GEA Press Release: \u201cGEA Hosted Public Consultation as Hosororo Hydro Power Project Commencement Date Draws Near\u201d Tumatumari Hydropower Station The first hydropower station, Tumatumari, utilising water from the Tumatumari Falls on the Potaro River, Region 8, was constructed in 1957 by British Guiana Goldfields Limited and operated until 1959 when mining operations ceased. In 1969, the Government of Guyana re-commissioned the station to serve the Guyana National Service Camps at Tumatumari and Konawaruk. The development included an embankment dam, a concrete overflow dam, and a 2-unit powerhouse with an installed capacity of 1,500 kW using (2 x 750 kW Francis turbines). The now defunct plant is currently being considered for rehabilitation by a private company.  Moco-Moco Hydropower Station  The Moco-Moco 0.5 MW (2 x 0.25 MW) hydropower project, Region 9, was commissioned on November 22, 1999. The hydropower station was designed and built by the Chinese through a joint arrangement between the Governments of Guyana and China. The Moco-Moco hydropower station is a run-of-the-river, diversion-type with a high water head. The Moco-Moco hydropower plant supplied power to the community of Lethem and its environs. Severe rainstorms and subsequent landslide on July 5, 2003 resulted in a fractured penstock. Government has since been actively discussing options for its restoration. Financing is needed for a geotechnical survey to inform the project design and assist in de-risking the project. The current concept of this project is to rehabilitate the defunct hydropower plant and increase the installed capacity to 0.7 MW. The site is located on the Moco-Moco Creek, which is a part of the Amazon River System originating from the north of Kanuku Ranges converging into the Takutu River. The project will provide electricity from an indigenous and renewable energy source to serve the demand of Lethem and its environs. This project forms a complementary suite of planned energy initiatives in the town, consisting of a hydropower plant and a solar PV farm.  Kumu Hydropower Station The proposed Kumu Hydropower Project entails the installation of a 1.5 MW hydropower plant and construction of a transmission line. The Kumu Creek, located in Region 9 (Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo), is also part of the Amazon River System. The creek originates from the north of Kanuku Ranges converging into Takutu River which is a boundary river between Guyana and Brazil. Kumu site is situated 9.5 km from the Moco-Moco hydropower station. The catchment areas of Kumu and Moco-Moco adjoin each other. The Kumu power station site is located 13 km south-east of the town of Lethem. The Kumu Hydropower Project will operate as a run-of-the-river type plant with an ultra-high head potential of more than 500 m. Its topographical specifications can accommodate the construction of a small reservoir on the top of the mountain plateau so as to maintain a constant water level for operation of the plant. The project will provide electricity from an indigenous and renewable energy source to serve the demand of Lethem and its environs. Together with the Moco Moco Hydropower Station, the Kumu hydropower plant can be a strong, reliable and redundant power supplier and controller for existing and future demand. The combined operation of the Kumu and Moco Moco hydropower systems, together with the planned solar PV, can result in 100% of renewable energy generation in the power sector of Lethem. Ikuribisi Hydropower Station The proposed Ikuribisi Hydropower Project entails the installation of a 1 MW hydropower plant and construction of a transmission line between the plant and the Bartica Power station. \u00a0The site is situated about 45 km south of the town of Bartica in Region 7 (Cuyuni-Mazaruni). The hydropower system will run as an energy storage hydropower plant with a reservoir, which can serve as a seasonal storage system. The project will provide electricity from an indigenous and renewable energy source to serve the demand of Bartica. Bartica is considered the gateway to the interior locations. Bartica has been designated Guyana\u2019s first Green Town. The Green Bartica Plan is a Government of Guyana initiative that involves a holistic approach to sustainable economic growth in the township. The main objectives of the plan are to create a climate resilient economy and to establish a green pathway for the foundation of a new Guyana, which will result in reducing the overall carbon footprint in electricity, agriculture, fisheries, water, forestry, waste, manufacturing, transport, construction, tourism and other sectors. This project forms a complementary suite of energy initiatives to support the Green Bartica Plan. In addition to hydropower, a 1.5 MW solar farm is being developed to displace diesel generators. The hydropower plant will add additional capacity to the grid to meet the town\u2019s growing demand which currently ranges from 2 MW to 3 MW. Region 1 Studies have estimated the potential capacity at Eclipse Falls as 4 MW. All data relating to this site is currently being updated under the Unserved Areas Electrification Program. Summary Data of the Pre-feasibility Study    Region\u00a07 The initial estimate of the potential installed capacity for this site was 320 MW, but the study carried out by the developers, Enman Services Ltd., has estimated an average power output of 760 MW with optimization of the dams. An MOU was signed with the developers in 2001.\nThis project would require the construction of an access road and transmission lines. It is envisaged that power would be available within 6-8 years of construction. The potential power to be produced is intended for export from Guyana to Brazil and in the future as a Phase 2 project to Trinidad & Tobago. Summary Data of the Initial Feasibility Study Reservior Region 7 An MOU was signed in February 2007 with Guyana Goldfields Inc. for a period of two years to conduct a feasibility study. This site has a proposed continuous energy of 62 MW but, is initially intended to supply 35 MW of electricity to its mining site at Aurora. Region 7 Government of Guyana and the Guyana Poverty Alleviation Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding in August 2003 to study the Arisaru site. This MOU was for a period of two years which has since expired. This site has a potential of 120 MW. Region 7 RUSAL, a Russian Company was granted exclusive rights in February 2007 for an initial period of three years to conduct a pre-feasibility study of this site. This site has a potential installed capacity of 1320MW and the Company is proposing to set up an Aluminum Smelter as the primary load centre. Based on previous studies, the following key parameters of the Upper Mazaruni Hydropower Station were identified in the RUSAL report. Summary Data Region 8 The Tumatumari Hydropower Station was the first hydropower station to be constructed on the Potaro River, Region 8. The plant was constructed in 1957 by the British Goldfields Limited and operated until 1959 when the mining operations were ceased. In 1969, the Government of Guyana re-commissioned the station where the power was transmitted to serve the Guyana National Service Camps at Tumatumari and Konowaruk. The development included an embankment dam, a concrete overflow dam, and a 2-unit powerhouse with an installed capacity of 1500 kW using (2 X 750 kW Francis turbines). THI and Hydro Quebec International signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the development of this Hydro station and are currently looking for a Developer to complete final works. Several MOUs were signed with various companies for the development of the Tumatumari Hydropower Project. However, all have since expired. Summary Data Region 8 The Amaila Hydroelectric project is being developed by Synergy Holdings Inc. The Feasibility study and the Environmental Impact Assessment have been completed. The feasibility study was completed in 2001 and then an Interim License was granted in July 2002 for two years and was subsequently renewed until July 2007. The Developer was granted a License to develop the project and is now in the process of securing financing for closure of the project. It is envisaged that this hydroelectric station will be commissioned by 2012. The Amaila hydroelectric station is conceived as a high head diversion scheme run of the river project.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Julia Love 8 Min Read MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - After a long push in Mexico, China\u2019s Huawei landed a coveted job in 2017: supplying equipment for the country\u2019s so-called \u201cred compartida,\u201d an ambitious telecommunications network built for carriers delivering the latest generation of technology. The contract came with a catch. Altan Redes, the company developing the network, announced that the most delicate work \u2013 involving the system\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d and sites near the U.S. border \u2013 would go to Nokia, and awarded Huawei southern and central Mexico. Political sensitivities around Huawei, which the United States has denounced since 2012 as an untrustworthy agent of the Chinese government, factored into the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. But limiting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s role was easier said than done. While sites along the U.S. border remain with Nokia, Huawei has since gained work in three cities in northern Mexican regions that Altan had said publicly would go to Nokia, according to four other people with knowledge of the matter and messages viewed by Reuters. Huawei began working in the cities late last year, one of the people said. The three cities - Tampico, Torreon and Culiacan \u2013 are located in northern Mexico but are not close the border. Altan\u2019s plans for the network are fluid and could change, the sources noted. Altan said in a statement that its decision to divide the work between Nokia and Huawei in that way was made \u201cexclusively on technical and economic optimization criteria,\u201d adding that it was not informed of U.S. concerns about Huawei. The company said no cities awarded to vendors were reassigned, and Huawei and Nokia \u201cequally delivered their plans.\u201d A U.S. State Department official said the department remains concerned that Chinese equipment in 5G networks could give the Chinese government access to sensitive data. A Huawei spokesman described the U.S. campaign as an effort to \u201cattack and contain Huawei, without presenting any concrete evidence.\u201d Huawei\u2019s northward expansion in Altan\u2019s network, previously unreported, underscores the Chinese firm\u2019s combination of speed, manpower and technological sophistication, Mexican telecom executives say. \u201cIt\u2019s too late\u201d to reverse Huawei\u2019s strong presence in Mexico, said Marco Galvan, a senior director for trade group GSMA. Huawei\u2019s potent appeal also shows how telecom operators globally are trying to balance the need for the Chinese company\u2019s affordable and reliable equipment with the U.S. campaign to steer countries away from using its gear, Mexican telecom executives say. After acquiring two local wireless companies, AT&T removed Huawei equipment from sensitive parts of its Mexican network. But AT&T still uses the Chinese firm\u2019s gear in the country, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That is due in part to Huawei\u2019s deep bench and swift execution, the people said. \u201cWhen we upgraded our Mexico network to 4G LTE, we replaced Huawei in our data core network because we wanted a data core network design like we have in the United States,\u201d AT&T Mexico said in a statement. The approaches taken by Altan and AT&T, detailed in interviews with two dozen people familiar with Huawei\u2019s operations, point to new ground rules for working with the Chinese company in Mexico: Limit use of Huawei gear in \u201cthe core\u201d - the brains of the cellular network that processes data from towers - and tread carefully along the border. But some telecom experts say it is harder to wall off the core in the coming fifth generation, or 5G, networks. In its statement, Altan said the nearest Huawei cell site equipment is 1,549 km from the border town of Tijuana and 499 km from Matamoros, which neighbors Texas. \u201cThe equipment disperses a signal with a radius of 15 kilometers, so there is not even remotely close contact with the northern border,\u201d Altan said. Three people familiar with the decision said Altan gave the northern cities to Huawei following some problems with Nokia\u2019s performance, including delays submitting documentation and slow response times. Dimitri Diliani, Nokia\u2019s global head of end-to-end solutions, said in an interview that the company met all key objectives and its share of the Altan project has not changed. \u201cYou always have hiccups and delays,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we passed all of the hurdles.\u201d Specific cities were not assigned in the contract, Diliani said. It is not unusual for some cities to shift within large projects, a Nokia spokeswoman added. Cesar Funes, a Huawei vice president, said Mexican customers have asked the company for its response to the U.S. allegations, but business remains strong. He said he was not aware of whether Huawei had won work in the three cities but noted the company has managed to extend its reach in past projects. Vendors typically start with a certain share of a project, \u201cbut based on your performance, you could get more,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI have experienced that already in this country.\u201d The U.S. government has intensified its fight against Huawei as countries prepare to deploy 5G networks, which will serve as the gateway to new technological frontiers such as self-driving cars and internet-connected appliances. Altan\u2019s wholesale network, which offers capacity to retail telecom competitors in Mexico, is prepared to quickly transition to 5G, the company has said. As early as the 1990s, Huawei executives began pitching their services in Mexico. Competing aggressively on price and recruiting talent, Huawei eventually won big swaths of the market, supplying virtually all major players, including Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim\u2019s America Movil. The wholesale network, part of a 2013-14 telecom reform aimed at promoting competition, was an enticing opportunity for Huawei to build a cutting-edge network from scratch, Funes said. Backed by a fund managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure and IFC Asset Management Company\u2019s China-Mexico Fund, Altan won a tender to launch the network in 2016. The prospect of Chinese participation in a sophisticated national telecom network attracted U.S. scrutiny early on. The U.S. State Department met with Mexico\u2019s ministry for communications and transportation twice in 2016 to voice concerns about Huawei\u2019s potential involvement in the project, according to a former senior U.S. State Department official. The State Department did not ask Mexico to ban Huawei, but it did warn Mexican officials of security risks posed by the Chinese firm, the former official said. Some Mexican officials questioned why the United States was so concerned since AT&T was working with Huawei in the country, the former official recalled. Salma Jalife, Mexico\u2019s undersecretary for communications and technological development, declined to comment. The State Department also met with Mexico\u2019s Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), which regulates the industry, in late 2016 to discuss concerns regarding Huawei\u2019s potential participation in the network, especially along the border, according to a Mexican official. A U.S. State Department official said the government works closely with Mexico and declined to comment on specific meetings. An IFT spokeswoman declined to comment. The Huawei spokesman stressed the company\u2019s independence from the Chinese government. Altan ultimately struck its compromise, tapping both Huawei and Nokia. \u201cThe balance of the allocation of infrastructure between the technological providers is optimal, avoiding an exclusive dependence on either one,\u201d Altan said in a statement. Most carriers in Mexico are still sold on Huawei, said Galvan of GSMA. \u201c(Huawei) brought as many resources as necessary to Mexico from China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did what it takes.\u201d Reporting by Julia Love; additional reporting by Tarmo Virki and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Se trata del proyecto hidroel\u00e9ctrico Quijos, que registra un avance del 46,7%; el proyecto Mazar con el 87,3% de obra; Toachi Pilat\u00f3n que registra un desarrollo del 85,4% y el proyecto termoel\u00e9ctrico Ciclo Combinado, con un avance del 57,47%. P\u00e9rez recalc\u00f3 que la resoluci\u00f3n de estos contratos depende de los procesos de mediaci\u00f3n que actualmente se desarrollan; la Contralor\u00eda General del Estado deber\u00e1 dar el visto bueno para solucionarlos. \u201cDebemos volver a sentarnos en la mesa para buscar una salida y para que esos activos y anticipos empiecen a rendir frutos para el pa\u00eds\u201d. En el caso de la hidroel\u00e9ctrica Toachi Pilat\u00f3n, el Banco del Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social (Biess) invirti\u00f3 $ 250 millones, pero la recuperaci\u00f3n del capital lleva dos a\u00f1os 11 meses de retraso, pues la construcci\u00f3n del proyecto no ha concluido. Ante ello el ministro P\u00e9rez asever\u00f3 que por ahora no habr\u00e1 una soluci\u00f3n a las exigencias de pago del Biess, hasta que no se resuelva la conclusi\u00f3n de la obra, algo que podr\u00eda demorar m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os. Otro de los problemas que debe solucionar el r\u00e9gimen es el redise\u00f1o de la hidroel\u00e9ctrica Coca Codo Sinclair, que en su inicio proyectaba una potencia instalada de 1.500 megavatios, pero en realidad alcanza esa cifra apenas por cuatro horas. \u201cPero s\u00ed podemos producir entre 900 y 1200 megavatios de una manera continua\u201d. La hidroel\u00e9ctrica Santiago tambi\u00e9n deber\u00e1 ser redise\u00f1ada pues se proyectaba una potencia de 3.600 megavatios, pero, seg\u00fan la estimaci\u00f3n del Gobierno, su capacidad es de 2.400 megavatios. \u201cDebemos ajustar esos dise\u00f1os, porque de nada sirve hacer inversiones por cierta cantidad de megavatios, cuando no podemos producir eso\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 P\u00e9rez. Por otra parte, adelant\u00f3 que la inauguraci\u00f3n de la hidroel\u00e9ctrica Minas-San Francisco est\u00e1 prevista para noviembre y Delsitanisagua para diciembre. Otra de las preocupaciones del Gobierno son las condiciones de estiaje que afectan el nivel de los r\u00edos, de los cuales dependen los proyectos de generaci\u00f3n hidroel\u00e9ctrica instalados. \u201cEn los \u00faltimos 40 a\u00f1os, las lluvias han bajado en un 7% y los meses de estiaje que eran de 2,5 meses hoy son 4,5 meses. Esa es una preocupaci\u00f3n cr\u00edtica y por ello se apunta a proyectos que se manejen a trav\u00e9s de motores a combusti\u00f3n de gas\u201d, reconoci\u00f3 el ministro. Producci\u00f3n petrolera en bloques 86 y 87 se apalanca en Per\u00fa La empresa estatal ecuatoriana Petroamazonas y la peruana Petroper\u00fa negocian el transporte de crudo, luego de que entren en producci\u00f3n los bloques 86 y 87 ubicados fuera de la zona intangible del Parque Nacional Yasun\u00ed, los cuales son parte de la ronda petrolera Sur Oriente. La iniciativa es poner esos campos en producci\u00f3n, a trav\u00e9s de una empresa inversionista y usar la infraestructura peruana para transportar el crudo a la refiner\u00eda en Talara, ubicada en el norte del Per\u00fa. El ministro P\u00e9rez dijo que el impacto en comunidades ind\u00edgenas en los bloques 86 y 87 ser\u00e1n m\u00ednimos, por lo que no esperan conflictividad. Sin embargo, el presidente de la Confederaci\u00f3n de Nacionalidades Ind\u00edgenas de Ecuador (Conaie), Jaime Vargas, manifest\u00f3 que se coordina una gran movilizaci\u00f3n nacional para rechazar la nueva ronda petrolera y la pol\u00edtica minera del Gobierno. \u201cEl extractivismo en nuestros territorios ser\u00e1 el punto de quiebre del gran di\u00e1logo nacional\u201d, advirti\u00f3 el dirigente ind\u00edgena.

            "text": " In the decade-plus since it became law, the Affordable Care Act has helped slow the explosive growth in health spending. But the United States still spends about twice as much per capita as other wealthy nations.  That leaves President Joe Biden with an enormous health care challenge, beyond leading the country out of the pandemic: curbing health care cost increases that, economists warn, are unsustainable. The political obstacles will be enormous. Biden faces a Republican Party that has spent the past decade trying to destroy the ACA. There also is a remote possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court will scrap Obamacare when it rules on a challenge to the law mounted by GOP state attorneys general, many legal experts say. And Biden will have to overcome the resistance of powerful medical and pharmaceutical interests that oppose price constraints. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re running up the down escalator,\u201d said Michael Miller, policy director of Community Catalyst, a Boston-based organization that advocates for universal health care.  Biden already has laid out some of the ways he hopes to stem health care costs, but most would require congressional approval.  He argues that a law creating a health insurance \u201cpublic option,\u201d a government-run plan available to all working-age adults, would inject more competition into the health care marketplace, leading to lower prices. He has promised to rein in drug prices, in part by getting Congress to remove the prohibition that prevents Medicare, the largest purchaser of medication, from negotiating prices with drug manufacturers. An additional 5.3 million Americans could gain coverage.  Biden also has pledged to aggressively use existing antitrust laws to stem the ever increasing consolidation of hospitals and physician practices, which he says lead to higher consumer prices. And Biden wants Congress to eliminate surprise medical billing and increase transparency to help patients decipher often obtuse medical bills.  The president\u2019s proposals would go beyond the provisions included in the ACA, which have helped slow the growth of health costs but still left the U.S. with health spending far out of line with the rest of the world.  \u201cThe ACA was the most significant legislative effort to address price that Congress ever undertook,\u201d said Frederick Isasi, executive director of Families USA, a Washington, D.C.-based health policy organization that promotes accessible health care for all. \u201cBut it just wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d A popular catchphrase during and after enactment of the ACA was the idea of \u201cbending the cost curve\u201d in health care. Instead of reducing health care spending, the goal was to slow its growth. The ACA has achieved that goal\u2014sort of. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too early to say that the ACA has bent the cost curve. It\u2019s just too soon,\u201d said Melinda Beeuwkes Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine. \u201cBut we can say we dented it.\u201d According to an analysis that Buntin and a colleague, John Graves, published in the journal Health Affairs last year, the average year-to-year growth in per capita health spending in the United States has declined under the ACA, falling to an average of 3.6% a year. That compares with average annual growth rates of 6.4% in the 1990s and 5.9% in the 2000s. In 2010, actuaries at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected that by 2020, health spending would gobble up 19.3% of all the country\u2019s goods and services. The actual percentage ended up being 17.7%, $525.7 billion below what was predicted. Analysts largely agree on the ways the ACA helped curb spending. One of the most obvious effects was the law\u2019s reduction in the rates Medicare, the government health program for older Americans, pays medical providers. Proponents were able to sell that payment reduction to providers because the ACA promised to insure millions more Americans, meaning more patients. Another way the ACA reduced spending was by dramatically changing commercial health insurance markets, particularly the markets for health insurance that people purchase themselves, as opposed to enrolling in coverage provided by their employers.  Prior to the ACA, that market was quite limited in size, with health insurers mainly competing for low-cost, young and healthy consumers. Insurers then either refused to cover people with chronic illnesses or charged them enormous premiums. As a result, many people went without insurance. The ACA prohibited such practices. Carriers could no longer reject customers because of their preexisting health conditions or charge them higher rates. The law also required all plans to offer a comprehensive package of benefits and provided federal subsidies to help low- and moderate-income people purchase policies.  Those changes created competition in the individual health insurance market for the first time, which in many places has resulted in lower premiums, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning Washington, D.C., think tank. \u201cAll these rules that were put in place made these markets operate in a way that was conducive to competition, which didn\u2019t even exist before,\u201d Blumberg said. The rules gave insurance carriers an incentive to negotiate better reimbursement rates with medical providers, she said, so they could offer lower premiums to beat their rivals. More support expected for insurance navigators, Medicaid expansion. Even Medicaid expansion, which some critics argued would crush state budgets, seems to have had a beneficial effect on state spending. So far, all but 12 states have opted to expand Medicaid eligibility to a broader swath of low-income adults, with the federal government picking up 90% of the costs, a portion significantly more than it pays in the traditional Medicaid program. Some ACA opponents feared that even paying the remaining 10% would be too much for states.  But studies show expansion has helped states save money by allowing them to leverage the higher federal match rate to pay for other state activities, such as direct payments to public hospitals or community mental health services. Medicaid expansion also has lowered what states spend on care for uninsured people.  However, some of the cost-reduction measures in the ACA haven\u2019t panned out. Too few carriers have elected to operate in some areas of the country, including many rural regions, depriving those communities of the advantages of competition. And despite the federal subsidies, premiums remain too high for many consumers. That is why Biden and congressional Democrats are pushing for more generous subsidies in the COVID-19 relief package now under consideration on Capitol Hill. The additional subsidies and other related proposed changes could bring 1.3 million people into commercial insurance, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated, a further spur to competition in the market. Another disappointment many health policy analysts point to is the work of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, established by the ACA to develop models that would improve quality and that would result in cost savings. \u201cThat has been going on for 11 years and hasn\u2019t produced a whole lot,\u201d said Dr. Robert Berenson, an internist, former member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee and a health policy fellow at the Urban Institute. The payment models produced underwhelming savings rather than game-changers. \u201cIt was basically let 1,000 blossoms bloom, but most of them just wilted.\u201d  Health economists and policy analysts say the ACA isn\u2019t solely responsible for the spending growth slowdown of the past decade. Other factors include the slow recovery from the Great Recession, which depressed spending generally; across-the-board spending cuts passed by Congress in 2011; unrelated cost-containment measures in Medicaid and Medicare; and the rise of high deductible health plans, which discourage people from going to the doctor.  \u201cOne can\u2019t say that [all of the growth slowdown] is due to the ACA,\u201d said Paul Van de Water, a health policy analyst at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, but \u201cthe ACA contributed to that drop.\u201d  Van de Water also noted that under the ACA, \u201chealth spending as a percentage of GDP dropped, despite the fact that more people were covered.\u201d The heart of Biden\u2019s health proposal is winning congressional approval for a Medicare-like public option. He argues that a public option would reduce health care spending by allowing the federal government to use its tremendous leverage to negotiate lower prices from hospitals and other health care providers. Two Democratic U.S. senators, Michael Bennet of Colorado and\u00a0Tim Kaine of Virginia, last month filed legislation that would create a public option, first in areas with limited competition and then nationwide by 2025. But it\u2019s unclear when the Biden administration will take on the issue, as it continues to focus on ending the pandemic.  Proponents of the public option argue it would force commercial carriers to lower their premiums if they don\u2019t want to lose customers to the government\u2019s new marketplace alternative. But opponents doubt that hospitals and other medical providers would accept the reimbursement rates that the public plan would have to offer to achieve the competitive advantage proponents are counting on. The pandemic could drive up Medicaid enrollment by 16%. The American Hospital Association and other hospital industry groups are on record opposing a public option. In an analysis conducted two years ago, they claimed a public option like the one proposed by Biden would result in a loss of $800 billion in hospital revenue, damage patient access to health care and disrupt other parts of the health insurance market. \u201cThis ill-conceived program would undermine access to care and threaten the ability of providers and clinicians to meet the needs of their patients,\u201d Chip Kahn, CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, said at the time. The hospital industry has not changed its view on the public option. Opponents of a public option dispute the idea that increasing federal subsidies for private health insurance would entice many more people into entering the market. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, argues that cost isn\u2019t the main reason those without health insurance don\u2019t have it. They say that many people simply don\u2019t see the benefit. Some conservatives also say Biden\u2019s plan to drop the Medicare prohibition against negotiating drug prices with manufacturers doesn\u2019t address the biggest driver of prescription drug costs\u2014the exorbitant pricing of single-sourced specialty drugs, particularly medications treating some cancers. Doug Badger, a health policy expert at the Heritage Foundation, said Biden\u2019s plan might discourage pharmaceutical companies from investing in research, thereby leaving needed treatments and cures undiscovered. He called it an irony that such a proposal is under discussion at time when pharmaceutical companies have in record time just created vaccines to combat the worst pandemic in a century. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to mess with a model that has shown such dramatic results at a desperate time,\u201d Badger said. But Badger is on board with Biden\u2019s aims to increase transparency in medical billing and stem the increasing consolidation of the health care industry, which Badger agreed is a major factor in high health costs in the United States. He also approved of bipartisan discussions in Congress to find ways to protect consumers from the high prices of some specialty drugs. There also has been support from both sides of the aisle in Congress to stop the practice of surprise medical billing, which occurs when patients are unexpectedly hit with huge bills from out-of-network medical providers. So far, medical providers and insurance carriers have successfully lobbied against those measures. \nAdvocates are hopeful, however, that Biden\u2019s focus on surprise medical billing could be enough to finally get the legislation over the hump. Primary care doctors are pressed to their financial limits. People who inject drugs (PWID) are at risk for overdose and also the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly when sharing unsterile injection equipment. To mitigate these harms, syringe services programs (SSPs) provide access to and disposal of drug use equipment such as syringes as well as social services and referrals to substance use and mental health treatment.   \n                    Daily update \u2014 original reporting on state policy, plus the day's five top reads from around the web.\n                "

(Image: Alamy) Frozen trade talks, failed infrastructure bids and cancelled projects suggest that Chinese companies\u2019 winning streak in Panama has come to an abrupt end. US diplomatic pressure on the government of Laurentino \u201cNito\u201d Cortizo, which took office in May last year, appears to have been effective in Latin America\u2019s most geopolitically strategic nation.\u00a0 Even before previous president Juan Carlos Varela\u2019s June 2017 decision to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing that seemed to blindside US diplomats, Chinese firms, both state run and private, had won tenders for port concessions, power projects and convention centres. In the following 18 months the process went into overdrive. Dozens of political and commercial deals were signed, free trade talks progressed at break-neck speed and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping made a December 2018 state visit.\u00a0\u00a0 But that visit was the high-water mark for Sino-Panamanian relations. In the US state department, the pushback had already begun.\u00a0 In September 2018, Washington recalled its heads of mission to Panama, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, whose governments had also recognised Beijing in recent months. A month later US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Panama City to warn against the \u201cpredatory economic activity\u201d of Chinese firms. US pressure put an end to China\u2019s plans to build a giant embassy at the mouth of the Canal. In Cortizo, the US found a more malleable ally. Despite hailing from the same political party as General Omar Torrijos \u2013 the national hero who negotiated the handover of the Canal from the US to Panama \u2013 Cortizo\u2019s administration appear to have heeded Washington\u2019s overtures.\u00a0 \u201cThe positions have flipped and the US is once again is the dominant foreign player in domestic politics,\u201d says Rodrigo Noriega, a political analyst and journalist.\u00a0 China has fallen out of the news and Foreign Ministry briefings. And a string of commercial decisions suggest a diminishing role.\u00a0\u00a0 A Chinese proposal for a US$4.1 billion high speed train linking Panama City with the north of the country was dismissed in September. A major electrical transmission project on the Caribbean coast \u2013 in which a Chinese group was amongst the two qualified bidders \u2013 was cancelled and recast as a public-private partnership.\u00a0\u00a0 In February, Panama Metro, the capital\u2019s rapid transport system, confirmed that Korea\u2019s Hyundai Engineering would build the third Metro line, a US$2.5bn 25-kilometre elevated monorail linking the centre with the western suburbs.\u00a0   The losing bidders, including two consortia with Chinese companies, challenged the decision, originally made in November. China Railway Group Limited offered a lower priced project but were disqualified for not meeting minimum technical requirements. \u201cIn January, no one had the slightest doubt that a Chinese firm would win the Metro tender,\u201d says Fernando Aparicio, professor of history at the University of Panama. \u201cIt\u2019s another indicator that the government wants to maintain a distance from China, or at least negotiate with China from a stronger position.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A few days after the metro announcement, the Ministry of Public Works confirmed that a new bridge over the canal, awarded in July 2018 to a consortium led by China Harbour Engineering (CHEC) and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), would be scaled back. Instead of running over the bridge, Metro line 3 will run through a tunnel 50 metres under the canal.\u00a0 Rafael Sabonge, the Minister of Public Works, says the decision was made due to the discovery of a geological fault under one of the bridges\u2019 key pillars that would have led to a delay in construction and incurred larger compensation payments to third parties.\u00a0 However, many remain sceptical that a tunnel under the Canal would make sense economically.  \u201cI think there are two factors at play,\u201d says Noriega. \u201cThe government can\u2019t afford a delay on the bridge and there are real operational challenges for running the metro on it. But there is also a political element. The Japanese underwriters don\u2019t want to finance a project of this size for a Chinese firm to build it and the US don\u2019t want Chinese firms building directly over the Panama Canal.\u201d\u00a0 the US still maintains huge clout over individual politicians, through the threat of visa denial or inclusion on the \u201cClinton list\u201d Hong Kong-owned Hutchinson Ports, the \u201cthird party\u201d operators of a port that would be most affected by the bridge\u2019s construction, publically denied it had requested compensation from the government for losses incurred during delays to the Chinese consortium\u2019s project.\u00a0\u00a0 The port has its own problems to deal with. In 1998 the company, then known as Hutchinson-Wampoa and with 10% investment from a Chinese state firm, won the concession to operate Panama Ports Company. US Admiral Thomas H Moorer told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the \u201cCommunist Chinese\u201d had \u201cvirtually accomplished\u2026a stronghold on the Panama Canal.\u201d\u00a0 In February this year, the Cortizo government announced it would audit Panama Ports. \u201cThere is a strong current in the government against renewing Panama Port\u2019s concession [which expires in 2022],\u201d says Aparicio.\u00a0 Meanwhile the free trade agreement, which many assumed would be rushed through by Varela before leaving office, remains unsigned and the Chinese embassy has no long-term home. The presence of Chinese engineers and businessmen has diminished. In April 2019, the first Air China flight \u2013 from Beijing via Houston \u2013 arrived in Panama City. In February the service was suspended.\u00a0 How has the US achieved such a turn around? \n According to Richard Koster, an author and journalist based in Panama since the 1950s, the US still maintains huge clout over individual politicians, through the threat of visa denial or inclusion on the \u201cClinton list\u201d \u2013 a who\u2019s who of companies and individuals that profit from money laundering and drug trafficking, leading to potentially severe sanctions by US prosecutors. \n In May 2016 Panamanian businessman Abdul Waked\u2019s inclusion on the list swiftly led to his bankruptcy, and, Koster says, local politicians haven\u2019t forgotten it.\u00a0 \u201cAnyone on the list has a type of financial leprosy,\u201d he says. \u201cPanama\u2019s politicians all come from money and have US dealings.

            "text": " \n\tIf 600 million more women were connected to the Internet over the next three years, global GDP would rise between $13 billion and $18 billion, said a new report by Zain Group, a regional leader in the mobile telecom sector.\n\n\tThe report \u201cWomen in Technology - Bridging the Gender Gap in STEM Fields\u201d provides insights on the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), highlighting the impact on socio-economic development across the board.\n\n\tThe release of the report, which coincides with International Women\u2019s Day, explores several important issues regarding the cause, nature, and effects of the challenges faced by women as related to STEM, and the prejudices they face even upon entering professions related to the subject area.\n\n\tBader Al-Kharafi, Zain Vice-Chairman and Group CEO said: \"The role of women in tech needs to be increased. It is that simple. Zain is continually driving equality programs, recognizing the need to push an agenda that is cohesive, inclusive, and fair to all. This thought leadership report is another tool to highlight the extent of the exclusion of women from STEM-related fields, and what is needed to close the gender gap across the region and beyond.\n\n\t\u201cSince the launch of our Gender Diversity initiative, we have invested in certifying over 100 females within Zain on the fundamentals of Data Analytics and Science. These colleagues then went on to take part in our group wide 12-hour datathon in April 2020 at the height of pandemic, and are now part of a talent pool of resources we tap into for tech related projects across our footprint. WE will continue to inspire learning through practice, and the engagement in this datathon has proven the resilience of our talented pool of women in STEM.\u201d\n\n\tJennifer Suleiman, Zain Group\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer said: \u201cZain has a long list of activities aimed at reducing the gender gap. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted glaring inequalities across so many aspects of modern life, and the plight of females in STEM-related fields is one of them. The timing and topic of our latest report that coincides with International Women\u2019s Day couldn\u2019t be more appropriate, and we hope it forces people to recognize the state of play when it comes to gender exclusion and the steps required to rectify it.\u201d\n\n\tThis latest and insightful thought leadership encompasses issues related to gender biases in STEM; innovation in STEM; developing STEM skills to achieve financial inclusion; and Covid-19 and women in technology. Core areas of discussion and highlights in the report include:\n\n\tAspects of Gender Disparity\n\n\tWomen account for half of the world\u2019s population and are fundamental to ensuring a sustainable future and peaceful societies. There has been some progress made towards achieving a more equal society, however, there is still a long way to go and according to the UN, the gender gap is considered \u201cthe unfinished business of our time.\u201d\n\n\tThe Gender Digital Divide \n\tStudies have shown that the gender digital divide is due to the lack of access females have in attaining digital skillsets that can help them advance and develop in the area. Additionally, women are more likely to represent lower income segments, leaving them unable to afford and purchase digital software and hardware.\n\n\tGlaring discrepancies exist with regards females gaining access to digital tools, including:\n\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0165 million fewer women own a mobile phone in comparison to men\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Globally, 433 million women are unconnected\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The global internet user gap is 17%\n\t\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If 600 million more women were connected to the internet over the next three years, global GDP would rise between $13 billion and $18 billion\n\n\tLiteracy and STEM Education\n\n\tAs the number of girls gaining an education increases, disparities associated with access to opportunities, quality and topics they choose to study becomes more evident. It is imperative for girls to further develop themselves in STEM education, as careers in these areas are seen as the jobs of the future, driving innovation, social well-being, inclusive growth, and sustainable development.\n\n\tZain Bahrain\u2019s Girls for Tech Camp, for example, was launched in partnership with the Kingdom\u2019s Supreme Council for Women and Clever Play, an organization that aims to inspire children\u2019s curiosity and passion for STEM. Established in October 2019, the program equips girls between ages 8 and 13 years with 10 hours of training in coding, and targets training 1,000 girls. In 2019-2020, 725 girls completed the program.\n\n\tEmployment Equality\n\n\tWomen are underrepresented in the technology sector and even though large strides have been made in STEM education, it has not translated into employment. Studies have shown that even though countries have largely invested in improving girls\u2019 education including STEM education, cultural and societal constraints have hindered this needed transition, impacting societies in a dramatic manner. This gap in STEM employment prevents economies from reaching their full potential as it omits half of the population\u2019s potential and talent to contribute to the economy.\n\n\tGender Biases in STEM\n\n\tGender stereotypes in the context of STEM start at an early age and continue to impact children at later stages in their lives. It has been studied that children\u2019s choices to enter STEM start as early as 3-5 years of age. By the ages of 6-10 years, girls start developing the notion that boys are better in math, which is not the case, as analyses show girls and boys in fact perform the same. Another stereotype that starts to emerge during this time is that males innately succeed in the field of STEM. These stereotypes continue to manifest throughout the course of women\u2019s education and career.\n\n\tInnovation in STEM\n\n\tSTEM plays a key role in creating innovative tools to address global challenges that our world faces. It has been proven that diversity in teams drives transformation as it brings about new ideas and perspectives. As men and women have different life experiences that lead to varied perspectives, such diversity in viewpoints triggers creativity and improves results. Merging STEM and diversity creates phenomenal growth opportunities.\n\n\tDeveloping STEM Skills to Achieve Financial Inclusion\n\n\tTechnology and digital services are seen as tools that can be used to enable development. When used to progress development, technology can be extremely transformational and improve social and economic outcomes. Such tools could also be used to improve distribution in addition to promoting inclusivity, increasing accessibility and allocating resources. With that being said, it is important for marginalized and disadvantaged segments to leverage tools that help elevate their standards of living and increase their access to services.\n\n\tCovid-19 and Women in Technology \n\tA needs assessment conducted by UN agencies highlighted that households led by women had less access to the internet than those led by males during these times of Covid-19. In addition, only 41% of women-led households claimed that their children had access to online websites created by ministries of education that supported the continuation of learning in comparison to 56% of male-led households.\n\n\tIn addition to learning inequalities, the increase of violence during lockdowns is extremely alarming as females are left vulnerable to dire situations. Digital advancements such as instant messaging with geolocation functions, domestic abuse hotlines, and disguised apps that provide discreet information for survivors in case their abusers continue to track them, can play a pivotal role in saving the lives of women. \u2013 TradeArabia News Service  Tags:\n"

            "text": " LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 5, 2021) \u2014\u00a02020 was a difficult year for mental health. Feelings of anxiety, sadness and loss were common for many. The global pandemic has led to suffering, death and grieving. Lockdown measures led to job loss and social isolation and the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other unarmed Black Americans has led to social unrest. Adrianna Fisher-Willis, staff psychologist\u00a0at the University of Kentucky Counseling Center (UKCC), says the events happening around us, even when the impact is not direct, have an immense effect on our mental health. \u201cWe live in a world heavily covered by the media,\u201d Fisher-Willis said. \u201cSocial media has provided everyone with a front row seat to images of racial injustice. Additionally, Americans everywhere became thrown into the devastation of COVID-19. When you combine this with the very normal impact of day-to-day stress of home, work and pre-existing mental health conditions, we are going to see major negative impacts on mental health.\u201d While 2020 was hard on the nation, for Black Americans, the burdens seemed heavier. Fisher-Willis says Black Americans have lived through a double pandemic. The impact of these repeated horrific incidents and the disproportionately high mortality rate of the coronavirus in Black communities has inflicted trauma on the broader African American community. To improve mental health resources provided through Work+Life Connections, UK HR collaborated with the College of Social Work (CoSW) to expand their services with therapists from diverse backgrounds to further support the mental health needs of Black and other diverse\u00a0faculty and staff. Work+Life Connections Counseling provides faculty, staff, retirees and their family members with five free counseling sessions with a certified or licensed therapist via telehealth. In addition to individual therapy, the team provides employees with mental health screenings, assessments and referrals to community-based resources, when needed.\u00a0 Therapists can help with feelings of stress, anxiety, depression, isolation and grief as well as family or relationship issues, sleep difficulty, trauma, parenting, identity concerns, and challenges at work.\u00a0 \u201cThe cost of therapy and a lack of mental health providers from diverse racial backgrounds are two of the biggest barriers to people seeking out help,\u201d said Erika Chambers, HR director of employee engagement and Work-Life. \u201cWe are beginning to address these barriers through a partnership with the College of Social Work, and the support of Dean Jay Miller.\u201d Miller said the decision to collaborate with HR was an easy one. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of mental health services are provided by social workers \u2013 so partnering with HR in this way is really a natural fit,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe College of Social Work is uniquely situated to partner in providing these services \u2013 we have clinical academic concentrations and work with others in the community to provide clinical supervision, services, education and training.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to get involved because it is vitally important that our faculty and staff have access to a diverse array of care providers,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cWe are working with HR to ensure access to a diverse array of therapists, and we are continuing to assess ongoing need as it relates to D&I and will respond accordingly.\u00a0Ensuring the mental wellbeing of our faculty and staff is a collective effort. That responsibility does not \u2013 and should not \u2013 fall solely to one unit or another. The College of Social Work is happy to contribute to the overall wellness mission of the university.\u201d Fisher-Willis believes these services are incredibly valuable. While it is up to employees to decide whether or not they feel they will benefit from these services, Fisher-Willis notes that free, diverse and available counseling services are a huge step in the right direction for creating this space. \u201cRepresentation always matters,\u201d Fisher-Willis said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of why I show up myself in this field, ready to work with clients to facilitate healing in their lives. Appointments can be booked on the newly redesigned\u00a0Work+Life Connections page. \u00a0For more information about mental health services and events for UK employees, please contact\u00a0worklife@uky.edu.\u00a0 The University of Kentucky is increasingly the first choice for students, faculty and staff to pursue their passions and their professional goals. In the last two years, Forbes has named UK among the best employers for diversity, and INSIGHT into Diversity recognized us as a Diversity Champion four years running.\u00a0UK is ranked among the top 30 campuses in the nation for LGBTQ* inclusion and safety. UK has been judged a \u201cGreat College to Work for\" three\u00a0years in a row, and UK is among only 22 universities in the country on Forbes' list of \"America's Best Employers.\"\u00a0 We are ranked among the top 10 percent of public institutions for research expenditures \u2014\u00a0a tangible symbol of our breadth and depth as a university focused on discovery that changes lives and communities. And our patients know and appreciate the fact that UK HealthCare has been named the state\u2019s top hospital for five straight years. Accolades and honors are great. But they are more important for what they represent: the idea that creating a community of belonging and commitment to excellence is how we honor our mission to be not simply the University of Kentucky, but the University\u00a0for\u00a0Kentucky."

Sign Up (Trinidad Guardian) China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) has been awarded a $221.7 million contract by the National infrastructure Development Company (Nidco) to build the controversial Curepe Interchange, the state company\u2019s chairman Herbert George has confirmed. The deal with CRCC was signed off on only recently after it won the bid and contract, bringing an end to three years of controversy and delays that had surrounded the proposed mega project. Fresh tenders went out on March 27 and closed on June 7. Of the five companies that submitted bids, three were local while two were Chinese firms. CRCC also won the contract for the Arima Hospital, which is being built at $1.2 billion, while they constructed the Scarborough General Hospital. \u201cCabinet has approved the preferred contractor China Railway. They will be the contractor doing the job. They have a joint venture with some local people, so they would do the project,\u201d George said at his El Socorro office last weekend. George said the cost of the project was reduced by a staggering $179 million, as the original price tag was $400 million He said the $221 million was VAT inclusive. \u201cSo we have saved the taxpayer quite a tidy sum, a substantial sum of $179 million in getting this project off the ground. We\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 did the tendering in a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 transparent way, where people were given opportunity to tender openly and that is what we got.\u201d He said one reason for the slash in price was that contractors had been submitting competitive bids, which was triggered by the slowed economy and stagnant construction sector, which was now gradually picking up with the number of projects Nidco had executed in the last few months. \u201cContractors are coming with competitive prices,\u201d George said. Nidco president Esther Farmer added that they had saved millions of dollars on a number of projects they executed. George said Nidco used a two-envelope system in the tendering process. \u201cOne deals with technical, so it gave us an idea of the structure of your company and how you propose to engage the job, as well as if you have the experience to give us confidence that you know what you are doing and you would be able to discharge your responsibilities.\u201d Asked when the project will begin, George said CRCC\u2019s contract was being prepared and should be ready and signed in next two weeks. Thereafter, CRCC will have to submit its insurance, performance bond and pre-payment bond. \u201cThese things would take a few weeks to finalise, but once we have everything in place work will begin full speed ahead.\u201d Asked where the funding for the project was coming from, George could not provide the details. \u201cThat would have to come from the Ministry of Finance. What we (Nidco) do is give the value. We will send it on to Cabinet and Cabinet is going to approve, they are the ones who source the funds. They will just send back to us and ask us to implement. They are the client and they will find the monies and so,\u201d George said. He said they hope work will start actually before the year\u2019s end. The project, which is a design build package, is expected to be completed in 18 months \u201cSo the contractor would be in place, he (CRCC) would start work, but his designers might be working out the details.\u201d George agreed the interchange would play a key role in alleviating traffic along the Southern Main Road and the Churchill Roosevelt Highway (CRH) which motorists have been experiencing for years. \u201cThis project is long overdue and it\u2019s welcoming that construction is finally going to take place,\u201d he said. He said Nidco would still have to ensure work was executed without causing disruption to motorists, commuters and businesses. Work on the interchange will start from the Southern Main Road and go all the way to the bustling intersection of the CRH. At the intersection, two loops will be built for motorists to get onto the west and east lanes of the highway. The traffic lights at the CRH intersection will be removed to allow vehicles a free flow onto the four lanes that will be constructed on the interchange. George assured that once the project got under way, it would help create jobs, stimulate the economy and eventually bring relief to thousands of frustrated motorists and commuters. In June 2015, then Opposition Leader Dr Keith Rowley had raised concerns about the $400 million Curepe Interchange project and called for it to be stopped after Nidco jointly awarded Lutchmesingh Transport Company and Vinci Construction the contract. The contract had been given to the two top bidders and was expected to start in July\u2014one month after, following a public falling out over the tendering process. Then former minister in the ministry of works and infrastructure Stacy Roopnarine had locked horns with her boss, Dr Suruj Rambhachan, after it was revealed that Lutchmesingh Transport had been selected for the job even though it ranked second in the tendering process. The first ranked bidder was Vinci Construction, who lost out because of its high costing for the mega project. However, Nidco decided to award the project jointly to the two top bidders, which then Nidco chairman Carson Charles had revealed to the T&T Guardian. This led to calls by Rowley to the then People\u2019s Partnership government, mere weeks from a general election, to immediately pull the plug on the contract. This was done and resulted in Lutchmesingh Transport initiating a lawsuit against Nidco over its rejected bid for the proposed interchange. The company sought damages through the court for wasted expenditure incurred participating in the tendering process, which it claimed was rendered pointless by Nidco\u2019s breaches of contract for the opportunity to obtain a profit-making contract. The action was filed in April 2015, two months after it was informed that its tender for the project was not considered. However Lutchmesingh Transport lost its million dollar lawsuit against Nidco when Justice Vasheist Kokaram upheld a preliminary application from Nidco\u2019s attorney and struck out the matter. When Rohan Sinanan was appointed Works and Transport Minister last November, reports surfaced on social media that he owned land once occupied by the Kay Donna Drive-In cinema on the CRH which was earmarked to be acquired for the interchange and was deemed a conflict of interest. Sinanan made it clear that while it was true he has an interest in the land with other stakeholders \u201cwhat has been circulating\u201d was not true, and he promised to recuse himself from the land acquisition process. \u00a0 \u00a0 A FREE roundup of top news from Guyana you might otherwise miss.

            "text": " TOBAGO HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY   In describing the event as an historic one for Tobago and its health sector, Secretary of Health and Social Services Assemblyman Claudia Groome-Duke said she was very pleased with \u201cOperation Nightingale\u201d during which 57 in patients were moved in an ambulance convoy with blaring sirens and police escort from the old Scarborough Regional Hospital at Fort King George two miles away to the new $750M institution overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The first patients to arrive at the institution at 8.43 a.m. were six children who were admitted to the paediatric ward. This was followed by the admittance of seven in-patients to the surgical ward, 10 to the maternity ward, eight to the medical ward and26 to the accident & emergency department. CEO of the TRHA, Paula Chester-Cumberbatch, reported that the transfer of the in-patients went smoothly. This operation included the Division of Health and Social Services, the Tobago Police and the Tobago Emergency Management Agency (TEMA). Chester-Cumberbatch said this new state of the art healthcare facility was designed to meet the needs of the growing population and to accommodate the changing face of healthcare in Tobago. \u201cThe new hospital aims to empower our clients to lead better lives by providing compassionate healthcare services and by building an environment where people feel welcomes and respected while receiving a range of improved and new services,\u201d she added. Full services which were available at the stroke of 8 a.m. were in the neonatal department, four operating theatres, medical imaging, rehabilitation and 19 speciality services. It also included improved security services such as an electronic locking system and baby monitors and an improved customer service. Eighteen new house officers, a variety of specialists and 50 nurses were added to the medical staff that served the old hospital. Secretary Groome-Duke who was at the old hospital to witness the loading of the in-patients and their intake at the new one said she was very happy to see manner in which they were handled. She said each patient was accompanied by their spouse, parent or guardian to ensure that they were comfortable during the transfer. She also congratulated the TRHA staff who came out to be part of \u201cthis historic exercise\u201d and said healthcare in Tobago can only move to higher ground\u201d. The sod for the institution was turned in February 2003 by then Minister of Planning Dr Keith Rowley, then Minister of Health Colm Imbert and THA Chief Secretary Orville London. It was originally estimated to cost $135M for construction through a loan from the IDB health sector reform programme. However, there were several delays in construction and the project stopped in 2006 in a dispute between the project managers, Nipdec and the main contractor NH International (Caribbean Ltd). Construction restarted under a new contractor, China Railway Construction Ltd in 2010 which was contracted to construct the buildings and supply the state of the art equipment. The financing, construction and equipping of the hospital were the responsibility of the Central Government with the Ministry of Health the client. While the THA and TRHA were given responsibility to operate the services as a unit of the ministry, it will have to wait until the government gets parliamentary approval for an amendment to the Regional Health Authority Act to vest the institution to the TRHA.

The loan terms of Tranche A have been applied to this project.In 2011, the Corporation Electrica del Ecuador (CELEC) awarded the 95.5 million USD contract to CNEEC to build the Quijos hydroelectric power plant. Celec awarded China National Electric Equipment Corp. (CNEEC) a US$94.7 million contract in December for construction and equipping of Quijos, to be complete by December 2015. However, by the end of 2015, state-owned Celec submitted its first request to the Public Procurement Service (Sercop) to include the Chinese company in the register for faults in a contract for construction, installation and commissioning of the 50 MW Quijos hydroelectric project. As of January 2017, the project is reported 46% completed. A CELEC project summary released in 2014 put the total project cost at 155,437,705.11 USD. It is unclear how much of the total project cost was financed by CDB, and the transaction amount is left blank for now.

Los trabajos empezaron en marzo de 2012 y deb\u00edan culminar en marzo de 2016, pero no se concretaron tambi\u00e9n por problemas t\u00e9cnicos, especialmente relacionados a la obra civil, por lo que los plazos tuvieron que ser extendidos. William B\u00e1rcenes, gerente de la unidad de negocios Celec-EP Enerjubones, mencion\u00f3 que uno de esos inconvenientes se localiz\u00f3 en la presa. La estructura, hecha con hormig\u00f3n rodillado, tiene una altura de 80 metros desde la cimentaci\u00f3n. Ah\u00ed se detectaron anomal\u00edas en el estribo izquierdo durante el proceso de excavaci\u00f3n, para reparar el da\u00f1o se tuvo que hacer una obra adicional de estabilizaci\u00f3n. B\u00e1rcenes asegur\u00f3 que la situaci\u00f3n fue resuelta. La presa est\u00e1 conformada por 11 bloques, un canal de aproximaci\u00f3n para facilitar la limpieza de los sedimentos, un cuenco amortiguador, dos atagu\u00edas y un t\u00fanel de desv\u00edo del r\u00edo. Los requerimientos adicionales tambi\u00e9n significaron incremento de costos. Al final la cifra fue de $ 479 millones. El funcionario aclar\u00f3 que no todos los frentes de construcci\u00f3n ampliaron sus presupuestos, en algunos casos se redujeron. Con corte a agosto de este a\u00f1o, Minas San Francisco registra un avance del 99,85%. Posee tres turbinas que generar\u00e1n un potencial nominal de 270 MW, con una producci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda anual de 1.290 GWh. La energ\u00eda se env\u00eda al Sistema Nacional Interconectado a trav\u00e9s de una l\u00ednea de transmisi\u00f3n de 42 kil\u00f3metros y 100 torres, que interconectan a la subestaci\u00f3n Minas con la subestaci\u00f3n San Ildefonso. A finales de octubre est\u00e1 previsto que culmine la fase de operaci\u00f3n experimental de las tres turbinas (cada una de 90 MW) y para noviembre se calcula que entre en operaci\u00f3n comercial.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters By Daniel Ramos 3 Min Read LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia has chosen a Chinese consortium to be its strategic partner on new $2.3 billion lithium projects, the government said on Wednesday, giving China a potential foothold in the country\u2019s huge untapped reserves of the prized electric battery metal. China\u2019s Xinjiang TBEA Group Co Ltd will hold a 49 percent stake in a planned joint venture with Bolivia\u2019s state lithium company YLB, the Bolivian firm said. Together, the companies will seek to produce lithium and other materials from the Coipasa and Pastos Grandes salt flats. Bolivia estimates that development of the projects will cost at least $2.3 billion. The Chinese firm will provide initial investment and YLB will pay its share with future lithium production, YLB\u2019s executive manager Juan Carlos Montenegro said by phone. Bolivia has some of the world\u2019s largest reserves of lithium - a key component in batteries that power electric cars - but has yet to produce the metal at a commercial scale. The preliminary deal gives Beijing a fresh chance at locking in access to Bolivia\u2019s lithium after German firm ACI Systems GmbH was chosen last year as partner on the country\u2019s largest lithium deposit in the salt flats of Uyuni. Xinjiang TBEA beat six rivals that also sought to partner with Bolivia on Coipasa and Pastos Grandes, including ACI, Uranium One - a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s state nuclear company Rosatom - and the Irish company Clontarf Energy Plc. \u201cWhy China? There\u2019s a guaranteed market in China for battery production,\u201d Bolivian President Evo Morales said in broadcast comments at a signing ceremony in the highland city of Oruro. China, the biggest global consumer of lithium, will need 800,000 tonnes of the metal per year by 2025 to support its booming electric car industry, China\u2019s Ambassador to Bolivia Liang Yu said at the same event, hailing the deal as \u201chistoric.\u201d There are no estimates yet for how much lithium Coipasa and Pastos Grandes hold. Bolivia said last month that a new study found that Uyuni likely has at least 21 million tonnes of lithium, more than double a previous estimate. Despite its abundant reserves and growing global demand for the metal, Bolivia\u2019s state-led plans to industrialize its lithium have faced repeated delays. The next steps on Coipasa and Pastos Grandes will be to conduct feasibility studies, YLB said. \u201cThis investment is not going to happen in a year. It\u2019s a long process of several years,\u201d Bolivia\u2019s Deputy Minister of High Energy Technologies Luis Alberto Echazu said. YLB added that it might partner with Xinjiang TBEA on a lithium battery plant in China.

            "text": " Abuja \u2014 The Director-General, Voice of Nigeria, VON, Mr Osita Okechukwu, has said that Nigeria has enough potential to repay its debt obligations to China through food export. Okechukwu stated this in a statement issued to journalists in Abuja on Sunday. He said that the government was not worried about the country's indebtedness to China as Nigeria's food export to the country could balance its trade deficit with the Asian nation. The All Progressives Congress, APC, chieftain noted that China's total food imports amounted to 58.28 billion dollars in 2020, up 25 per cent year-on-year, while the annual average growth rate over the previous five years was 5.7 per cent. According to him, with vigour and dedication, the Federal Government could have a big cut from the over $50 billion dollars China spends on food importation. Also read: BLOCKADE OF FOODSTUFFS: We're already feeling the pains -- Market leaders He, however, urged youths to join President Muhammadu Buhari's Agro-Revolution for the country to attain food security and exports. Okechukwu said, \"It's high time our youths joined the Federal Government's Agrarian Revolution for food security and exports. Methinks Nigeria can repay Chinese loans with food exports. China imports food in billions of dollars annually. \"It is painful that our youths are not engaging sufficiently in agriculture, especially the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP).\" Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

The APC chieftain queried, \"Is it not embarrassing that advanced countries like Europe and the United States have more food to export than an agrarian country like Nigeria? \"Improved agricultural production will boost rail haulage on the domestic side and food export to China will definitely improve and balance our trade deficit with the country. The same goes for the US which, some years ago, enacted AGOA for countries like Nigeria. But we have been unable to exploit it because of our over-dependence on oil.\" But on the practicality of his hope on food exports to repay Nigeria's huge loans from China, especially when insecurity is affecting farming activities, Okechukwu said: \"Insecurity cannot continue indefinitely; more so, Mr President has emphatically ordered the arrest of those herdsmen bearing arms without a licence. And don't forget that many states are quietly curbing the farmers-herdsmen clashes. In Enugu for instance, we have Forest Guards and in the South West we have Amotekun.\" Read the original article on Vanguard.

            "text": " The Esperanza camp, which is part of the San Carlos Panantza mining complex in Ecuador, was intentionally set on fire and destroyed this weekend, according to information made public by the Ministry of\u00a0 Energy and Natural Non-Renewable Resources. The copper project, located in the southeastern province of Morona Santiago, is operated by Explorcobres S.A.(EXSA), a subsidiary of Chinese-owned, Canada-based Corriente Resources. According to the ministry, the arsonists also stole valuable objects from the camp. San Carlos Panantza has seen its fair share of conflict since the early 2000s, as it is opposed by the Shuar First Nation, in whose ancestral territory the project sits \u201cWe reject these acts of vandalism and the destruction of the property that belongs to the San Carlos Panantza mining project,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cWe also reject the fact that the decree of state of emergency was violated.\u201d Two weeks ago, Ecuador declared a state of emergency to deal with the growing number of COVID-19 infections. As of Sunday, the country had registered 1,835 confirmed cases and 48 deaths. Besides pointing out the fact that the vandals violated the mandatory curfew that goes from 2 p.m. to 5 a.m., the Ministry of Energy also insinuated that police didn\u2019t do their job as they are mandated to guarantee the safety of mining operations. \u201cWe demand that authorities investigate this incident so that those responsible for the fire can be held accountable,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 reads. San Carlos Panantza is an advanced-stage project whose reserves have been estimated at 6.6 million tonnes of copper. The 41.760- hectare property is set to host an open-pit operation expected to be active for at least 25 years.\u00a0   Corriente Resources no longer has any relationship to Canada. Does this mean that gold prices are going to get higher."

He said the nature guide gives directions on how to get to a site and what to look for in regard to flora, fauna and geology. Thacker said the sites range from being within city limits and accessible by bike or public transit, to those\u00a0requiring a vehicle to access. \"We've added 10 new sites to the guide,\" Thacker said. \"And we've expanded the size of the book in terms of number of pages. We've also added pages where we explain about things like different kinds of rock formations or things like butterflies.\" Thacker said book was designed by Ingrid Paulson in Toronto who has done publication design for the Royal Ontario Museum and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection.The printing is being done by Friesens in Altona, Manitoba. Thacker said both Paulson and the print shop have a famous connection. \"During one of our e-mail exchanges, I mentioned our printers [to Paulson] \u2014\u00a0who we had already lined up \u2014 and I said they had actually done a number of the books in the Harry Potter series,\" Thacker said . \"And she said, 'yes I know, I designed one of them'. So that was a bit of an eye opener, too. She's done a beautiful job.\" Thacker said the guide is currently at the printers, and they are hoping to release it for sale on their website and Facebook page on\u00a0March 22.

In March, Mexico imported over 800,000 b/d of gasoline and diesel, according to government data. The country sources most of its imports from the US. A new 35-km pipeline will connect Dos Bocas with Minatitlan. From there, fuel can flow to Mexico City and the Port of Salina Cruz through existing infrastructure, Pemex said in a statement. Salina Cruz is a major marine logistics point, distributing fuel to Mexico's Pacific Coast. Dos Bocas will be able to supply the Yucatan Peninsula using marine shipments to Puerto Progreso. Pemex did not mention how work began at Dos Bocas. However, on May 25, the company awarded a dredging contract for the river next to the site of the refinery. Dos Bocas will process Maya heavy crude, Mexican Energy Secretary Rocio Nahle said. Maya is Mexico's landmark crude blend with a 3.4% sulfur content and 22 API. The refinery's expected output is 170,000 b/d of gasoline, 120,000 b/d of diesel and an unspecified volume of jet fuel and asphalt, she added. \"Fuel production is a great business worldwide. For Pemex, it has represented years of profits and work,\" Nahle said. Dos Bocas should take five years to pay back its construction costs based on the current profit margins of a 350,000 b/d refinery in the US, she added. The construction process for Dos Bocas will involve six tenders, which Pemex will award by the end of June. The project will cost Peso 150 billion ($7.6 billion), of which 33% has already been assigned under Pemex's 2019 budget, Nahle said. Pemex unsuccessfully tried to award a project management contract Dos Bocas May 9. Among the interested companies were Batchel, Techint, KBR, Jacobs. However, none could not match the government's demands that the refinery be built in less than three years and for less than $8 billion. Pemex CEO Octavio Romero Oropeza said the port of Dos Bocas is the optimal place to build a new refiner, as the area gathers and exports over 1 million b/d of crude. The construction of Dos Bocas \"is the beginning of the recovery of the nation's security through the exercise of our national resource sovereignty, especially oil,\" Romero said. The refinery \"will allow the creation of a fair, just and generous homeland,\" he added. -- Daniel Rodriguez, daniel.rodriguez@spglobal.com -- Edited by Keiron Greenhalgh, newsdesk@spglobal.com  LNG,Natural Gas -   October 15, 2021  -      READ >     S&P Global Platts has responded to the changing landscape of the North American natural gas market by adding 8 Mexico...

            "text": " A decade ago, Ecuador was highly dependent on fossil fuel production for power generation, with thermopower plants accounting for about half of energy production. Fossil fuels also represented almost the half of the exportations from the country. About 40 per cent of the population had a subsistence livelihood, and rural and indigenous populations faced a lack of access to electricity. In 2006, hydropower represented 44 per cent of energy production with 1,640 MW installed capacity. Ecuador took the decision to exploit its hydropower potential, estimated at more than 20,000 MW, to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel and foster economy growth. Hydropower is crucial in the government\u2019s strategy to change the energy mix, increase energy security and reduce energy cost. Framed in the National Plan for Good Living 2009\u20132013, the most important milestone was the decision to begin the simultaneous construction of eight hydropower projects that will increase the total capacity by 2,832 MW. Ecuador aims to have one of the cleanest energy mixes in the world by generating 90 per cent of its energy from hydropower once all the plants are in full operation in 2017. With these eight hydroelectric projects, Ecuador will be able to satisfy the national domestic energy demand and export surplus energy to Colombia and Peru. The government estimates this will save millions of USD by not importing fossil fuels to operate thermopower plants, and will also reduce CO2 emissions. Within the framework to eradicate poverty, promote sustainable development and equitable redistribution of resources, Ecuador now leads in promoting energy security in the region. The grid has also been strengthened by more than 2,000 km of transmission lines and an increase of transformative capacity by 74 per cent in one decade. In order to connect the new hydropower plants to the national electricity grid, 600 km of high-voltage 500 kV transmission lines are under construction. They connect four substations: one in the north-east, close to the 1,500 MW hydropower plant Coca Coda Sinclair; two in the centre close to Quito and Tisaleo; and one in the south-west in Guayaquil, increasing the supply reliability to the country\u2019s major demand centres. Power generation, distribution and commercialisation are managed by the state-owned company CELEC (Electric Corporation of Ecuador). Ecuador\u2019s most emblematic hydropower project, the 1,500 MW Coca Coda Sinclair plant, went into full operation in November 2016. The first four Pelton units started to generate electricity in April just three days before the 7.8 magnitude earthquake. The plant did not suffer any damage and continues to supply power to the national grid. The USD 2.25 billion project was 70 per cent financed by the Chinese Exim Bank and built by the Sinohydro Corporation. It is the largest hydroelectric project in Ecuador, and the largest built by China overseas, meeting 30 per cent of total domestic electricity demand with a mean annual generation of 8,734 GWh. The Sopladora hydropower project, the third largest in Ecuador, was completed in August 2016. At a cost of USD 755 million, the project was 85 per cent financed by the Chinese Exim Bank and built by a Chinese consortium. The station is part of the Hydropaute cascade scheme in the Paute River, located in the south-east. Sopladora relies on the water discharged by the upstream 1,075 MW hydroelectric plant Molino. Three Francis turbines with a power of 487 MW will supply an average annual generation of 2,770 GWh to the national grid, meeting about 13 per cent of energy demand. Five other hydropower projects from the government\u2019s strategic plan are in an advanced stage of construction. They are spread across the country, and CELEC plans to start their operation in 2017. These include Minas San Francisco (275 MW), Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n (254 MW), Delsitanisagua (180 MW), Quijos (50 MW), and Mazar-Dudas (21 MW). This country profile was last updated in May 2017.

The \"potentially hazardous\" space rock was expected to fly past Earth on Friday (March 5, 2021) in the evening. Officials believe The God of Chaos asteroid is potentially hazardous because of its size and how close it is to Earth. Scientists believe the asteroid is 1,017 ft to 2,230 feet and will pass Earth tonight by 10,225,000 miles, which is equal to 43 times the distance from the earth to the moon, Newsweek reports.  The asteroid is named Apophis nicknamed the God of Chaos, after the Egyptian god. \"This will be the closest approach by something this large currently known,\" NASA said about the asteroid's Friday night fly-by, according to the Daily Star. \"Apophis will be visible to the naked eye for several hours, and Earth tides will probably change its spin state.\" Scientists will be monitoring the God of Chaos asteroid closely because if its close trajectory to Earth - expected to be only 19,800 miles from Earth when it returns in April 2029.

NASA/IAC/UAE Space Agency // Wikimedia Commons On December 9, 1965, in Kecksburg, PA, a large object streaked across the sky, seen by thousands in nearby counties and states. The object, described as a \u201cclay acorn the size of a Volkswagen with Egyptian hieroglyphs running around the base,\u201d crashed shortly outside of Kecksburg only to be immediately secured by soldiers. The military claimed that nothing had crashed or been removed, and that all reports to the contrary were false. Many associate the event with the Roswell UFO crash, going as far to dub it \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s Roswell.\u201d  U.S. Navy National Museum of Naval Aviation // Wikimedia commons Kentucky Air National Guard pilot Captain Thomas Mantell was sent to investigate a UFO sighted near Fort Knox on January 7, 1948. Mantell\u2019s pursuit ended in flames\u2014the pilot pursued the object at too high an altitude, blacked out from lack of oxygen and spiraled out of control. The government later revealed that the UFO was, in fact, another classified weather balloon from Project Skyhook. This explanation, however, did little to calm public nerves, and previous awe of the potential for extraterrestrial life began shifting to fear of an otherworldly hostile takeover.  chris_ford_uk // Flickr Long Island has become a hotspot for UFO sightings over the last decade, with the number of reported events in Suffolk County on the rise. A cluster of yellow lights flying over Sand\u2019s Point has caught the public\u2019s attention, though police and other investigators are still struggling to explain the sightings. By Anonymous // Wikimedia Commons The Morristown UFO sighting on January 1, 2009, involved reports of five red lights in the sky. Two men later took credit for the lights, claiming that they had been conducting a social experiment to prove the faultiness in eyewitness accounts for such an event.  be creator // Flickr One of the few encounters with UFOs to result in civil court proceedings, the Cash-Landrum incident occurred on the evening of December 29, 1980, outside of Dayton, TX as Betty Cash and Vickie and Colby Landrum were driving home from dinner. The witnesses allege that they saw a diamond-shaped spacecraft burst into flames, expelling a tremendous amount of heat as it struggled to remain in the air. Cash observed it for some time before it was able to right itself and return to higher altitudes, where it was then surrounded by helicopters later identified as tandem-rotor CH-47 Chinooks. Health problems akin to ionizing radiation later arose in all three witnesses, leading them to sue the U.S. government for $20 million. The case was later dismissed for lack of evidence that the tandem-rotor CH-47 Chinooks were related to the U.S. government.  DragonRal // Flickr Several individuals reported sightings of a saucer-like object floating over Vancouver, on February 20, 2011, which remained unsolved for months. The UFO was revealed to be a Chinese-made kite made of parachute fabric embedded with hundreds of multi-color LED lights in a triangle shape, standing 7 1/2 feet tall with a wingspan of 13 feet.  Kelly // Flickr In Valensole, France, farmer Maurice Masse observed the touchdown of an oval structure standing on four legs in a nearby field on July 1, 1965. Walking towards it, he encountered two short gray figures with large, tapered heads and eyes who pointed an apparatus at him, freezing him in his tracks. The figures then flew the spacecraft away, leaving Masse frozen in place for twenty minutes. The story is considered a classic UFO encounter, with Masse\u2019s good character confirmed by authorities in the area.  DragonRal // Flickr Betty and Barney Hill were a couple from New Hampshire who claim to have been abducted by aliens on the night of September 19, 1961. They say they were taken by short gray men in uniforms onto a saucer-like aircraft, and examined. After their release, the Hills struggled to recall the event, turning to hypnosis to fill in the gaps in their memories. These events are some of the most widely referenced in pop culture, with details from their accounts used in episodes of \u201cThe X Files\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201d  DragonRal // Flickr The RB-47 high-altitude strategic bomber jet possessed the most advanced electronic intelligence equipment at the time, but was unprepared for a fly-by with a passing saucer, culminating in one of the most-discussed UFO sightings of the last century. In the early morning of July 17, 1957, the radar of an RB-47 over the southern U.S. picked up an unexplained blip before both the pilot and crew of the plane witnessed a blinding blue light. Authorities were quick to dismiss the sighting as an airliner, a claim quickly ridiculed by the public.  fdecomite // Flickr Reports on October 23, 2010, of large, cigar-shaped flying ships over the missile silos of Warren Air Force Base coincided with troubling reports of more than 50 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles going offline.

Artist's interpretation of the goblin\u2014Public domain The Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter is one of the first documented alleged encounters with extraterrestrial beings. Residents of a farmhouse arrived at a local police station on August 21, 1955, claiming that figures from a flying spaceship were attempting to gain access to their house. Police reported bullet holes in the sides of the home, but no evidence of the intruders. They ultimately credited meteors and Great Horned Owls as the alleged \u201clittle green men.\u201d  Amanclos // Flickr Considered the catalyst for modern interest in UFO sightings, Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine strange objects flying around the Cascade Mountains to the East Oregonian. The ensuing article sparked national interest in the alleged UFOs that were described as flying in formation, between 9,500-10,000 feet in elevation and traveling about 1,200 miles per hour\u2014far faster than any plane in use commercially or by the military.  Jan-Mallander // Pixabay On August 25, 1951, three professors from Texas Tech reported sightings of an unusual formation of lights over Lubbock, TX. Similar sightings were reported over the next few days in neighboring towns, and Texas Tech freshman Carl Hart Jr. managed to snap a few pictures of the phenomenon. Extensive studies from Project Blue Book determined these observations to be light from street lamps bouncing off the reflective feathers of birds in flight, but many dismissed this explanation, alleging that the lights were moving too fast to be birds.  Diliff // Wiikicommons The 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident, otherwise known as the Invasion of Washington, was a cluster of UFO sighting reports to Project Blue Book and the U.S. Air Force. Occurring over consecutive weekends in July, unknown radar returns and visual sightings of unexplained aircraft produced mounting waves of public hysteria, leading to a demand for explanations from President Truman. The Air Force credited the reports as heat wave mirages, misidentified stars, satellites and asteroids, and hallucinations, but later created the Robertson Panel to closely examine all findings by Project Blue Book.  Pocketthis // Wikimedia Commons On March 30, 2018 two pilots reported the same unidentified flying object passing over their planes in two different locations. Both pilots requested to know if there were any scheduled flights overhead of their pre-planned routes, to discover there were none. Authorities are still attempting to explain how the same UFO could be observed by two different planes within minutes of each other.  Max Pixel Charles Hall, a former nuclear physicist and ex-military American weather specialist, alleges that he encountered white, human-like figures who enjoyed attending shows at nearby Caesar\u2019s Palace while serving as a weather observationalist on the Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The base has since closed, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Hall from writing a book about the experience, and launching a press tour.  DragonRal // Flickr If you\u2019ve ever seen Close Encounters of the Third Kind, you\u2019re familiar with the scene in which a passing UFO causes electronic equipment to go haywire in the cars below. This references a real-life report of extraterrestrial happenings in Levelland, TX, during which car engines and lights cut out as bright lights and rockets passed overhead. Investigating police officers experienced the same phenomenon, only to have Project Blue Book explain everything away as ball lightning during an electrical storm. Interestingly, there were no reports of either happening in that area at the time.  AlphaTangoBravo // Flickr Logger Travis Walton and six workmates reported seeing a shimmery silver saucer on November 5, 1975, in Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest near Snowflake, Arizona. The workmates fled as the saucer flew closer, leaving Walton by himself to be abducted and missing for five days after the report. Walton\u2019s story is considered by most to be false, as there were several discrepancies in both his and his workmates\u2019 accounts of the tale.  Peter-Lomas // Pixabay Documented by Raymond Fowler in his book, \"The Andreasson Affair\", Betty Andreasson\u2019s abduction occurred in January of 1967 in South Ashburnham, MA. Like many other abduction tales, Andreasson claims that she and her family were enjoying a calm evening before seeing blinking lights that were then followed by short, gray-skinned life forms with pear-shaped heads and large, cat-like eyes. Andreasson was put into a trance and taken aboard the aliens\u2019 ship where she was examined and told the meaning of life, then had her memory erased. These memories were recalled under hypnosis.  seanbjack // Flickr On June 30, 1983, hundreds of basketball-sized lights were reported around a suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana, leaving unusual marks behind.

Lukas skywalker // from Wikimedia Commons The Tehran UFO incident occurred on September 19, 1976 after reports from concerned citizens of a bright light in the sky. Two F-4 fighter jets were released at different times that night to investigate the occurrence, with the first returning to base shortly after departure due to a total blackout of equipment while approaching the unidentified light. The pilot of the second F-4 achieved radar lock on the light before the UFO released a streak of light. As the pilot prepared to engage, all systems and equipment malfunctioned. U.S. Air Force section chief Lieutenant Colonel Olin Mooy was consulted, and provided an explanation: the light had been Jupiter, which was unusually bright that night, the planes had simply been faulty and the streaking light had been an errant meteor from a passing shower. \u00a0  By MCSA Kelly M. Agee // Wikimedia Commons More recently, the USS Nimitz UFO incident occurred on November 14, 2004, when Commander David Fravor and Lieutenant Commander Jim Slaight were investigating a nearby UFO during a routine training mission. The pilots then observed a 40-foot oblong ship that flew erratically at 80,000 feet before dropping down to 50 feet above the ocean. The ship approached the U.S. jet, then sped away as the two pilots pursued, ultimately returning to the USS Nimitz.  PxHere (screenshot it) Several sightings of unknown objects were reported to the Breckenridge police force on October 3, 2014, though authorities did little other than observing the phenomenon for themselves. No official investigation was ever launched, but several speculated that the lights were high-altitude balloons or Google Loons, giant balloons the company planned on using to bring wireless internet to rural communities.  V\u00e1mos S\u00e1ndor // Wikimedia Commons On August 11, 2014, many called in sightings of a ring of flashing lights flying in a thunderstorm. What makes this unique? Someone caught the ring of lights on camera, and though the body of the UFO is transparent, the ring is clearly captured. When asked for an explanation, image, and video, analyst Marc Dantonio explained that if footage of the event was examined separately, one could see it was only mall lights in the distance.

            "text": " Yesterday was International Women\u2019s Day and it is 110 years since the first one was held, having been discussed at the International Socialist Woman\u2019s Conference held in Germany in 1907. This was a historical moment in which the women\u2019s movement was radical in nature and known for its campaign for electoral participation. Writing for slow news website Tortoise, Liz Moseley lamented this loss of radicalism, saying: \u201cThe whole IWD thing has gone . . . well, it\u2019s all a bit \u2018bake sale\u2019 isn\u2019t it?\u201d True though this may be, International Women\u2019s Day affords us all a vital reminder of the historical struggle women, and other groups, have faced, but also offers the opportunity to reflect upon those women who have shaped, and continue to shape, who we are. I think of my mum, my wife, my daughters, my gran, my mother-in-law, my sisters-in-law, and, today, in particular, my grandmother \u2013 who passed away in 2008 \u2013 but who left an indelible mark upon my life. Else Louise Nitsche was born in 1922 in the small West German town of Kamp Lintfort, only a 30-minute drive from the Dutch border. She grew up in a slice of history wedged between the First and Second World Wars and married Charles \u2013 my grandfather \u2013 who fought on the opposing side for the British Army. You can imagine the visceral racism she experienced, as a native German, marrying a British-born man and relocating to Scotland a few years after the end of the war. My grandparents were as much a debating society as they were a family. I spent much time with my grandad Charlie, who died when I was 10. Part of the Forgotten Army stationed in Burma, he carried lifelong trauma and hated the triumphalism of war movies. My gran told me he came home drunk one night and, like the feisty, protective woman she was, she held her three boys \u2013 my dad included \u2013 behind her as she wielded a frying pan at him if he dared come near. He decided against. Her hospitality was second-to-none. Like most women of her time, she could rustle up a meal with minimal provisions and made many traditional German dishes with sweet, sour and pickled flavouring, including sauerkraut, red cabbage and pickled green beans. Always on the hunt for a bargain, my dad reminded me of the time towards the end of her life he offered, as a church minister, to do her funeral and she responded, saying: \u201cGreat! That\u2019ll save some money.\u201d The word \u201cradical\u201d is defined as \u201caffecting the fundamental nature of something\u201d. Born only 15 years after the first International Socialist Women\u2019s Conference held not far from her home, Else might not be the kind of woman you would describe as radical in a political sense but she definitely was on a personal level as she certainly affected the fundamental nature of those she raised, myself included.

Nester Hosiery designs and manufactures innovative socks for mountaineers, firefighters, military personnel, athletes, and anyone who loves a perfect pair of socks. \u00a9 Dreamstime. 8th March 2021 \nKnitting Industry\n\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nMount Airy, NC, USA\n Hosiery/\u200bSocks \nA North Carolina based socks manufacturer was honoured earlier this month, in the 2020 Governor\u2019s Export Awards. Mount Airy headquartered Nester Hosiery Inc. was one of 13 North Carolina companies to win the award, recognized as one of the state\u2019s top rural exporters, according to a report in The Mount Airy News. \n\u201cGrowing our global business has been a core initiative for us, all the while remaining true to our North Carolina roots,\u201d Matt Brucker, vice president of sales at Nester Hosiery, told the newspaper. \u201cWe produce some of the most innovative socks in the world and do everything with an eye on our communities, both locally and globally. We are well positioned for the future as we continue to build solid, mutually beneficial relationships with our customers, brands, and licensing partners,\u201d he said. \nNester is a long-established socks maker known particularly for its Farm to Feet socks, which are made exclusively from American-made raw materials, in US based factories. According to the report, the company has also been successful in recent years in securing a large military contract and retooling some of its production facilities to make PPE needed by healthcare and other workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAccording to Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s office, the 13 winners \u201crange from a small wooden-boat builder in southeast North Carolina to one of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world,\u201d the report said. \n\u201cThese diverse companies raise the profile of North Carolina-made products around the world, promoting excellence in goods and services made possible by the exceptional workforce in our state. Today, we honour these companies for the way their exports promote the North Carolina economy, their grit during tough economic times and the more than 412,000 jobs they support state-wide,\u201d Cooper said. \nEach of the manufacturers being recognized has turned to the state for help increasing its international sales. These free services are delivered through the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina which selects award winners from the more than 600 companies its international trade team supports each year. \nNester Hosiery, the state said, consulted with the state economic development partnership overseas trade offices and used partnership-administered federal grants to help pay for trade show participation in Germany. \nIn addition to Nester, the other award-winners include: Advanced Superabrasives Inc. in Madison County; C.R. Onsrud Inc. in Iredell County; Budsin Electric Boats in Carteret County; Latitude Aero in Guilford County; Grady-White Boats in Pitt County; Novo Nordisk in Johnston County; Glen Raven Inc. in Alamance County; Nufabrx in Catawba County; Redeye Worldwide in Orange County; Tactical Support Equipment in Cumberland County; DGL Logistics in Mecklenburg County;\u00a0Sharyn Koenig of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. \n\u201cWe assist manufacturers with everything from export-education seminars and foreign market intelligence to trade show support and introductions to international distributors,\u201d John Loyack, Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina vice president for global business services told The Mount Airy News. \n\u201cAnd since the pandemic shut down international travel and in-person trade events, we\u2019re helping more exporters pivot to doing business virtually,\u201d Loyack said. \u201cThat includes leveraging grants that help manufacturers pay for exhibiting in online trade shows, or for translation and search-engine optimization of their website in other countries.\u201d \nNester Hosiery Website \nTwitter\u00a00\nFacebook\u00a00\nLinkedIn\u00a00\nEmail\u00a00\nvar switchTo5x = true;\n\nstLight.options({\n        publisher: \"56c21450-60f4-4b91-bfdf-d5fd5077bfed\",\n        doNotHash: false,\n        doNotCopy: false,\n        hashAddressBar: false\n      });\n Nester Hosiery welcomes new investment Kayser-Roth closes Tennessee hosiery plant New R&D Innovation Centre for Sateri Business intelligence for the fibre, textiles and apparel industries: technologies, innovations, markets,\ninvestments, trade policy, sourcing, strategy...

            "text": " New York Governor Andrew Cuomo defiantly rebuffed calls for his resignation as more women have\u00a0come forward\u00a0with sexual harassment allegations against him, saying Sunday \"there is no way\" he will step down. But shortly after his press conference, New York State Senate Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat, said he \"must resign.\" \"Everyday there is another account that is drawing away from the business of government,\" Stewart-Cousins said in a statement Sunday afternoon. \"We have allegations of sexual harassment, a toxic work environment, the loss of credibility surrounding the COVID-19 nursing home data, and questions about the construction of a major infrastructure project. New York is still in the midst of this pandemic and is still facing the societal, health and economic impacts of it. We need to govern without daily distraction. For the good of the state Governor Cuomo must resign.\"\u00a0 Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, also a Democrat, stopped short of saying outright that Cuomo should resign, but said in a statement that Cuomo should \"seriously consider\" if he can lead the state. \"I too share the sentiment of Senate Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins regarding the Governor's ability to continue to lead this state,\" Heastie said. Cuomo insisted earlier Sunday that he continues to be focused on the state's COVID-19 response and vaccination effort, and said he would not be \"distracted\" by the allegations. \"I was elected by the people of the state, not by politicians,\" Cuomo told reporters Sunday. \"I'm not going to resign because of allegations. The premise of resigning because of allegations is actually anti-democratic.\" Cuomo has spent the weekend reaching out to state leaders and legislators telling them he will not resign, two people familiar with the conversations told CBS News. In telephone calls, the governor is repeating what he has said publicly: Be patient and allow an investigation overseen by New York Attorney General Letitia James to proceed. In these conversations, Cuomo is asking for due process, saying that others who've faced similar allegations have been afforded an opportunity for investigations to play out before potential accountability, according to one of the people familiar with the outreach. Another person told CBS News that Cuomo has support across the state, \"But you never know how deep or wide.\" It was not clear who exactly the governor spoke with or how many calls he made, but the list includes Stewart-Cousins and other legislators, the two people said. Two more women came forward on Saturday with allegations that Cuomo acted inappropriately, making it five women who have accused him. While\u00a0Cuomo said last week\u00a0he was \"embarrassed\" and apologized for \"any pain I caused,\" he struck a more defiant tone on Sunday. He has said an alleged incident with one woman, Lindsey Boylan, \"didn't happen,\" and he said Sunday allegations from a former aide, Karen Hinton, are \"not true.\"\u00a0 One of Cuomo's accusers, Charlotte Bennett, described him as a \"textbook abuser\" in an\u00a0exclusive interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O'Donnell. Bennett alleges that on June 5 \u2014 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in hard-hit New York \u2014 Cuomo asked her if she was ever intimate with an older man and said he was comfortable dating women decades younger than him. Text messages sent by Bennett\u00a0to a friend and reviewed by CBS News memorialized her encounter with Cuomo immediately after the alleged conversation. In the messages, Bennett told a friend that Cuomo \"talked about age differences in relationships.\" Her friend, who verified the messages, asked: \"Wait what,\" and \"Did he do something.\"\u00a0 \"No,\" Bennett responded. \"But it was like the most explicit it could be.\"\u00a0 When asked by CBS News on Sunday if he was made aware of\u00a0Bennett's complaint at the time, Cuomo said he was not. He again insisted he would be awaiting the results of an investigation by Attorney General Letitia James. \"This is not about me or accusations about me \u2014 the attorney general can handle that. This is about doing the people's business,\" Cuomo said. \"These next six months will determine the future trajectory of New York state.\" On Sunday, the editorial board of the Albany Times Union, a newspaper that endorsed Cuomo's three campaigns for governor, said Sunday that he must step down. But the newspaper focused on the other scandal embroiling the governor: The deaths of thousands of state residents at nursing homes during the pandemic and his administration's alleged attempts to\u00a0cover up\u00a0the full scope of the problem. \"New York cannot get through this public health crisis if New Yorkers don't know whether the governor and health officials are being honest with them from one day to the next,\" the editorial board wrote. \"Today was a body blow, for sure,\" said a state official, granted anonymity to speak frankly about the governor's political standing amid concerns about potential retribution. \"It ain't over 'til it's over, but this was a bad 24 hours for him.\" Cuomo said he has been focused on getting the state budget approved. New York state's constitution mandates the budget be approved by April 1, and Cuomo submitted his budget in mid-January. According to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, New York will be getting $12.5 billion in stimulus money in the\u00a0recently passed federal relief package, although Cuomo had sought $15 billion.\u00a0 \"This does not mean it's going to be an easy budget, but now it will be a possible budget,\" Cuomo said.\u00a0 Cuomo also announced Sunday that with the exception of New York City, restaurants in New York state will now be able to open at 75% capacity.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell, Michael Kaplan, Julie Morse, Adam Verdugo and Caitlin Yilek contributed to this report.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Jose Llangari 3 Min Read TUNDAYME, Ecuador (Reuters) - Copper output began at the Chinese-owned Mirador mining project in southern Ecuador on Thursday, a milestone in market-friendly President Lenin Moreno\u2019s effort to boost the mining sector and wean the OPEC nation\u2019s economy off its dependence on oil. Ecuador, an Andean country neighboring No. 2 copper producer Peru, has large mineral reserves but is only beginning to develop industrial-scale mining projects. Mirador has an estimated 3.2 million tonnes of copper reserves, along with 3.4 million ounces of gold and 27.1 million ounces of silver Ecuacorriente, a subsidiary of the Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan which has a 30-year concession to mine Mirador, says it expects to produce 94,000 tonnes of copper concentrate per year. The company has invested some $1.4 billion in the project and paid $85 million in government royalties, official data show. \u201cFor the first time, with the Mirador project, Ecuador will produce copper and become an industrial-scale exporter of minerals,\u201d Carlos Perez, Ecuador\u2019s minister of energy and non-renewable natural resources, said at a ceremony marking the mine\u2019s inauguration. The CRCC-Tongguan consortium bought the company with the concession for the open-pit mine under former leftist President Rafael Correa, who deepened Ecuador\u2019s economic ties with China. During Correa\u2019s 10-year tenure, the world\u2019s No. 2 economy invested in major electricity projects and lent billions in loans-for-oil deals with state-owned Petroecuador. Moreno, who was elected with Correa\u2019s endorsement in 2017 but has since earned his former mentor\u2019s ire by shifting economic policy to the right, has focused on improving Ecuador\u2019s investment environment to attract Western companies. Other major mining projects in Ecuador include the Fruta del Norte gold mine, - operated by Canada\u2019s Lundin Gold; the Cascabel copper, gold and silver mine, operated by Australia\u2019s Solgold; and the Llurimagua copper mine, to be operated by Ecuador\u2019s Enami and Chile\u2019s Codelco. Some of those projects have run into opposition from nearby communities, which are concerned about environmental damage.

            "text": " Off-stream reservoirMechanical excavation n/a 163 MW 2010 The Confluencia hydropower project, located in the Chilean Andes, is fed by water from seven intakes. The Tinguiririca intake features an off-stream reservoir to provide peaking services. It also serves as a very efficient sedimentation basin, which helps to protect the turbines.  \u200d The Confluencia hydropower project is a run-of-river project located about 160 km southeast of Santiago de Chile in the region of O\u00b4Higgins. Owned by Tinguirica Energ\u00eda, a joint venture between Pacific Hydro and Statkraft, the Confluencia project entered into operation in 2010, and has an installed capacity of 163 MW. As shown in the scheme of figure 1, the project uses the water from the Tinguiririca, Portillo and Azufre Rivers, as well as another four small tributaries. The main intakes, Tinguiririca and Portillo, feature weirs and desanders to divert water to the headrace tunnels, of 9.2 km and 12 km, with design discharges of 26.5 m3/s and 25 m3/s respectively. The secondary intakes can divert between 1.5 and 2.3 m3/s. Tinguiririca intake also includes an off-stream regulating reservoir with 1.2 Mm3 of storage to provide peaking services. It can supply water for six hours of generation at full capacity. The annual observed sediment load through turbines is 71,000 t/yr. The sediment concentration at Confluencia is between 80-1,000 ppm, with about 25 per cent hard minerals. The river bed load consists of cobbles and boulders. The expected generation is 656 GWh, but due to the sediment problems the production loss is almost half. The current average annual generation is 374 GWh. The rainy season in 2016 was characterised by increasing runoff, which led to higher sediment transportation. The heavy sediment load of the Tinguiririca River caused major damage to the Tinguiririca facilities and access roads. Figure 2 shows an aerial view, where the sediment load has turned the river brown. The sediment-related costs at the Confluencia project are estimated to be 8 per cent of the project\u2019s annual revenue. The main sediment-related costs are the maintenance and replacement of components damaged by the extreme sediment concentration, and the sediment mechanical dredging at the intakes. The civil works to repair the Tinguiririca facilities and access road caused by the high precipitation and heavy sediment load in 2016 include mechanical dredging, the expansion of two gutters to 500 m and 450 m, and other works to improve the access roads. The off-stream reservoir is best suited to providing short-term storage for the Confluencia run-of-river plant, providing daily flow regulation for power peaking. This off-stream reservoir only uses the Tinguiririca intake and includes a desander prior to the 1.2 Mm3 regulating pond (see figure 3). The single regulating pond has been sized with respect to the powerhouse discharge rather than the intake capacity, as no regulation volume is provided for the other intakes. Nevertheless, the other intakes discharge directly to the powerhouse following desanding. Desanders are typically provided to reduce sediment load and also to prevent the deposition of coarse sediment in the conveyance facilities. However, the off-stream reservoir for power peaking will be much larger than a desander, and will act as a very efficient sedimentation basin for the material not trapped in the desander. This is beneficial from the standpoint of protecting turbines. The off-stream reservoir entered into service in May 2011 but by 2017 had not yet experienced a sedimentation problem in the reservoir that required dredging. The sediment consists of silt, with negligible amounts of clay, and after an initial period of accumulation the rate of sediment accumulation slowed substantially or halted because the sediment was being carried out of the pond by normal operational drawdowns in the off-stream reservoir.  \u200d \u200d \u200d  This is part of a series of sediment management case studies collated by the International Hydropower Association with support from the South Asia Water Initiative (SAWI), trust funds to the World Bank.

This one is beneath the ocean. While the U.S. wages a high-profile campaign to exclude China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co. from next-generation mobile networks over fears of espionage, the company is embedding itself into undersea cable networks that ferry nearly all of the world\u2019s internet data. About 380 active submarine cables\u2014bundles of fiber-optic lines that travel oceans on the seabed\u2014carry about 95% of intercontinental voice and data traffic, making them critical for the economies and national security of most countries. Current and former security officials in the U.S. and allied governments now worry that these cables are increasingly vulnerable to espionage or attack and say the involvement of Huawei potentially enhances China\u2019s capabilities.

U.K. CANADA U.S. BRAZIL Sources: Huawei Marine; TeleGeography Huawei denies any threat. The U.S. hasn\u2019t publicly provided evidence of its claims that Huawei technology poses a cybersecurity risk. Its efforts to persuade other countries to sideline the company\u2019s communication technology have been met with skepticism by some. Huawei Marine Networks Co., majority owned by the Chinese telecom giant, completed a 3,750-mile cable between Brazil and Cameroon in September. It recently started work on a 7,500-mile cable connecting Europe, Asia and Africa and is finishing up links across the Gulf of California in Mexico. Altogether, the company has worked on some 90 projects to build or upgrade seabed fiber-optic links, gaining fast on the three U.S., European and Japanese firms that dominate the industry. These officials say the company\u2019s knowledge of and access to undersea cables could allow China to attach devices that divert or monitor data traffic\u2014or, in a conflict, to sever links to entire nations. Such interference could be done remotely, via Huawei network management software and other equipment at coastal landing stations, where submarine cables join land-based networks, these officials say.  \u201cWe are acutely aware of counterintelligence and security threats to undersea cables from a variety of actors,\u201d said William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. \u201cGiven that undersea cables carry the bulk of the world\u2019s telecommunications data, safeguarding these cables remains a key priority for the U.S. government and its allies.\u201d So far, Western allies have pushed the company out of at least one international project and tried unsuccessfully to thwart another.  Huawei Marine said in an email that no customer, industry player or government has directly raised security concerns about its products and operations. Joe Kelly, a Huawei spokesman, said the company is privately owned and has never been asked by any government to do anything that would jeopardize its customers or business. \u201cIf asked to do so,\u201d he said, \u201cwe would refuse.\u201d The U.S. has been lobbying allies hard, warning Germany in recent days that it would limit intelligence sharing with Berlin if Huawei built the country\u2019s next-generation mobile-internet infrastructure.  Last week, Huawei filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court challenging a law that restricts federal agencies from doing business with the company. Longer term, the U.S. and some of its allies see Huawei and its undersea cable business as part of China\u2019s strategy to boost its global influence by building telecom infrastructure and exporting digital technology, including surveillance tools.  The U.S. has sought to block Huawei from its own telecom infrastructure, including undersea cables, since at least 2012. American concerns about subsea links have since deepened\u2014and spread to allies\u2014as China moves to erode U.S. dominance of the world\u2019s internet infrastructure. \u201cThis is another vector by which Huawei gets into the infrastructure of another country,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. William Mayville, who until last year was deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command.  \u201cFailing to respond to Huawei Marine cedes space to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. and its partners must meet and compete.\u201d Undersea cables are owned mainly by telecom operators and, in recent years, by such content providers as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n\n\n       and Google. Smaller players rent bandwidth. Most users can\u2019t control which cable systems carry their data between continents. A handful of switches typically route traffic along the path considered best, based on available capacity and agreements between cable operators.

U.S.-led efforts to crimp Huawei\u2019s undersea cable business, as with 5G, have had mixed success.  In June 2017, Nick Warner, then head of Australia\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service, traveled to the Solomon Islands, a strategically located South Pacific archipelago. His mission, according to people familiar with the visit, was to block a 2016 deal with Huawei Marine to build a 2,500-mile cable connecting Sydney to the Solomons.  Mr. Warner told the Solomons\u2019 prime minister the deal would give China a connection to Australia\u2019s internet grid through a Sydney landing point, creating a cyber risk, these people said. Australia later announced it would finance the cable link and steered the contract to an Australian company. \u201cThe concern was China could have an ability to in-build security vulnerabilities,\u201d an Australian security official said. \u201cIt really mirrors the issues with 5G.\u201d In another recent clash, the U.S., Australia and Japan tried unsuccessfully in September to quash an undersea-cable deal between Huawei Marine and Papua New Guinea. Huawei Marine said it uses some hardware and network management software from its Chinese parent company, and was \u201cwilling to make any product available to any security expert or government agency for evaluation.\u201d  Industry representatives and some experts say most security risks in the undersea cable system can be mitigated. While submarine cables can be physically cut or disabled, technology makes it more difficult to intercept data undetected, said Kent Bressie, legal adviser to the International Cable Protection Committee, an industry group that includes Huawei Marine. Landing stations are usually protected by fencing, guards and security cameras, Mr. Bressie said, and network management systems are designed to be walled off from the broader internet.  \u201cIf there are new risks or information that industry doesn\u2019t have,\u201d Mr. Bressie said, \u201cthere needs to be communication from governments to operators.\u201d U.S. and allied officials point to China\u2019s record of cyber intrusions, growing Communist Party influence inside Chinese firms and a recent Chinese law requiring companies to assist intelligence operations. Landing stations are more exposed in poorer countries where cyber defenses tend to be weakest, U.S. and allied officials said. And network management systems are generally operated using computer servers at risk of cyber intrusion. Undersea cables are vulnerable, officials said, because large segments lie in international waters, where physical tampering can go undetected.  At least one U.S. submarine can hack into seabed cables, defense experts said. In 2013, former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden alleged that Britain and the U.S. monitored submarine cable data. The U.S. and its allies now fear such tactics could be used against them. American and British military commanders warned recently that Russian submarines were operating near undersea cables.  Last year, the U.S. sanctioned a Russian company for supplying Russian spies with diving equipment to help tap seabed cables. China seeks to build a Digital Silk Road, including undersea cables, terrestrial and satellite links, as part of its Belt and Road plan to finance a new global infrastructure network.  A Pentagon report in January said these projects, while benefiting host countries, could help China obtain foreign technology and \u201cenable politically motivated censorship.\u201d  Chinese government strategy papers on the Digital Silk Road cite the importance of undersea cables, as well as Huawei\u2019s role in them.  Planned cables FRANCE Marseille PAKISTAN EGYPT Gwadar Karachi DJiBouTI SOMALIA KENYA SEYCHELLES SOUTH AFRICA Sources: Huawei Marine; Peace Cable International Network A research institute attached to China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, in a paper published in September, praised Huawei\u2019s technical prowess in undersea cable transmission and said China was poised to become \u201cone of the world\u2019s most important international submarine cable communication centers within a decade or two.\u201d China\u2019s foreign and technology ministries didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Huawei Marine said it had no official role in either the Belt and Road or Digital Silk Road programs. Huawei Marine has a Communist Party committee, as Chinese law requires, but said the committee had no management authority.   Huawei Marine, based in the Chinese port of Tianjin, was formed in a 2008 venture with Global Marine Systems, a British company with ships to handle undersea cables. Global Marine was a successor to the entity that laid the first undersea telegraph cable in 1850, which connected England to France.  Huawei owns 51%. Global Marine\u2019s 49% stake is in play: Parent company \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        HC2 Holdings,\n\n\n       headed by former hedge-fund manager \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Philip Falcone,\n\n\n\n       said in October it was exploring a potential sale. That would open the door for Huawei or another Chinese company to take full ownership, which could require approval by British authorities. Britain\u2019s national security adviser, Mark Sedwill, told a parliamentary hearing in 2017 that attacks on undersea cables could have \u201cthe same effect as used to be achieved in, say, World War II by bombing the London docks or taking out a power station.\u201d  HC2 and Global Marine both referred questions on Huawei Marine to Huawei, which declined to comment. Early on, Huawei set its sights on expanding its business to the U.S. In 2007, Huawei Technologies installed equipment to upgrade the Hibernia Atlantic trans-Atlantic cable between landing stations in Lynn, Mass., and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

It also agreed to build and provide $250 million in financing for a new trans-Atlantic link called Project Express, connecting New York and London for the financial industry. Bjarni Thorvardarson, then chief executive of the cable\u2019s Ireland-based operator, said U.S. authorities raised no objections until 2012, when a congressional report declared Huawei Technologies a national security threat. Mr. Thorvardarson wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt was camouflaged as a security risk, but it was mostly about a preference for using U.S. technology,\u201d he said. Under pressure, Mr. Thorvardarson dropped Huawei Marine from Project Express in 2013. The older cable network continued to use Huawei equipment. Virginia-based GTT Communications now operates the cables formerly known as Hibernia Atlantic and Project Express, and it recently won a contract to provide trans-Atlantic communications for the Pentagon. GTT and the Pentagon both declined to say if the cables still used Huawei technology. Huawei Marine hasn\u2019t worked on U.S.-connected cables since 2013. Elsewhere, it has thrived. The company is now the fourth-biggest player in an industry long dominated by U.S.-based SubCom and Finnish-owned Alcatel Submarine Networks. Japan\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            NEC Corp\n\n\n       is in third place.

Completed cables CAMEROON Kribi BRAZIL Fortaleza Source: Huawei Marine Some of the cables connect to U.S. allies, including Britain, Canada and France. Government agencies in those countries declined to say whether those cables still used Huawei technology. Most other Huawei Marine projects are in the developing world, including newer ones financed by China\u2019s state-owned companies.

In Pakistan, the cable network will land in Gwadar, a port China is developing as part of Belt and Road and where U.S. officials believe Beijing wants to open a naval facility, which China has denied. The cable is planned to connect to a land-based link with China. \u2014Max Colchester, Drew FitzGerald and Paul Vieira contributed to this article.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Alexandra Valencia, Brian Ellsworth 7 Min Read QUITO (Reuters) - Conflicts with indigenous communities have stalled operations at Ecuador\u2019s San Carlos Panantza copper mining project, which the government of President Lenin Moreno had long pointed to as an example of mining sector expansion that would generate $40 billion in export revenue over the next decade. Many now view the $3 billion project bankrolled by China\u2019s ExplorCobres S.A. as emblematic of the turmoil impeding Ecuador\u2019s push to become an Andean mining power to rival Peru and Chile. The project had been slated to start exporting copper this year, but a dispute with the Shuar indigenous community led ExplorCobres to halt the project nearly two years ago, according to the country\u2019s mining authority, which says the company does not believe conditions on the ground are suitable to resume work. Unknown assailants in March set fire to mine installations and stole equipment. In a series of complaints, indigenous groups say the government did not adequately consult them about projects. The strife is undermining Ecuador\u2019s ambitious plans to develop large-scale mining as an alternative to its oil industry. \u201cThere is not a consensus on what role mining should play in the development of economy, and communities often feel like they\u2019ve been run over,\u201d said Sergio Guzman, Andean region director for consultancy group Colombia Risk Analysis. \u201cA conciliation is needed between the (government\u2019s) mining objectives, and how this results in (benefits) for the communities.\u201d Of the five projects with $7 billion in investment that form the backbone of the mining effort, two - including San Carlos Panantza - have completely halted. A third is relocating some facilities due to local opposition. Other projects that are less advanced face pushback from local leaders still unconvinced their communities will benefit from an industry plagued by worries about environmental damage and limited job creation. On Wednesday, Ecuador\u2019s electoral court approved a referendum to be held in February that will ask voters if they want to outlaw mining near rivers that run through the city of Cuenca. The results would be binding but not retroactive. Mining industry leaders complain that such referendums change the goal posts on projects that were developed under a different set of guidelines from Ecuador\u2019s government. The resistance could undermine Ecuador\u2019s efforts to generate tax revenue to ensure a return to economic growth and bolster state finances after an IMF-backed debt restructuring plan this year. Ecuador lags Chile and Peru in mining development despite having what are believed to be ample deposits of copper and gold. It has not completed enough exploration to determine total mineral reserves, according to the government. The industry will generate about $4 billion in tax revenue and some $40 billion in export earnings over the next decade, according to the government\u2019s most conservative estimates. Mining Deputy Minister Cesar Vasquez told Reuters in a recent interview that Ecuador is prepared to adjust timeframes so concessions do not expire due to social conflicts. Still, he acknowledged that community resistance was dampening investor enthusiasm. \u201cThere are people who are opposed to mining activity and they are going to (oppose it) with or without the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state will always act within the law to defend the interests of the country.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s mining effort can boast some success stories. The Fruta del Norte gold mine led by Canada\u2019s Lundin Gold Inc is already exporting. The same is true of the Mirador copper mine owned by a subsidiary of Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan Investment, the ultimate parent of ExplorCobres. Canada\u2019s Solaris Resources, in charge of the now-exploratory Warintza copper-molybdenum project, created a strategic alliance with two communities of the Shuar people in September after three years of dialogue. But community opposition has taken its toll - particularly at San Carlos Panantza, which has never been on good terms with the local community. \u201cThe government approved concessions years ago without providing information and without the knowledge of the Shuar-Arutam people,\u201d said Josefina Tunki, president of the Shuar-Arutam. \u201cThe people have said \u2018no\u2019 to having this large-scale extractivist company in our territory.\u201d Indigenous activists said the mine\u2019s first camp in 2016 displaced eight families and eliminated the ancestral village of Nankints, triggering a standoff with the Shuar people that year that left one police officer dead and five wounded. Then-president Rafael Correa described them as a \u201cminuscule group of extremists,\u201d denying the area was ancestral territory and ordering a military occupation. ExplorCobres did not reply to a request for comment. In March, it issued a statement condemning the attack on the project, calling them \u201cdelinquent acts by armed groups that came from outside the zones of influence of the project.\u201d Moreno, elected in 2017, hoped to turn the page on the incident. But by 2018, the mining authority had agreed to indefinitely extend the time frame during which ExplorCobres could carry out exploration, citing social conflict. The Shuar people filed a lawsuit to have the entire project scrapped and demanded damage payments from ExplorCobres for the forced displacement of its people, but the case was thrown out by a provincial court in 2019. The Shuar are now taking the fight beyond Ecuador\u2019s borders, saying in November they will file a complaint with the International Labor Organization against Ecuador. The complaint will argue that granting the mine concessions without the group\u2019s permissions violates ILO statutes on the rights of indigenous peoples. Though an ILO decision alone would not alter the course of the mine, a negative recommendation would pressure authorities by staining Ecuador\u2019s reputation in the diplomatic community. The office of Ecuador\u2019s attorney general, which represents the country in international legal disputes, said it had not been informed about the complaint. \u201cWe will never allow extractivist companies into our territory, we want to live in a territory without pollution,\u201d said Tunki at a press conference.

            "text": " Nearly 20 percent of Afghan women journalists have quit or lost their jobs in the past six months, a media watchdog group said Monday, as a wave of murders targeting the press has intensified in the war-torn country. The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee said that more than 300 women had left the industry in recent months, citing the \"wave of targeted killings\" as one of the main reasons -- along with financial difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The report comes as the world marks International Women's Day and less than a week after three female media workers from Enikass TV were gunned down by militants in the eastern city of Jalalabad in an attack claimed by the local Islamic State group affiliate. Another woman working for the station was murdered in December. On Monday, Enikass said it had asked all remaining women staffers to stay home until security improves. \"I love journalism but I also love to live,\" Nadia Momand, a presenter at Enikass, told AFP. \"I'm not going to go out again unless they send me an armoured vehicle.\" \"There is no protection for them,\" said Zalmai Latifi, the broadcaster's director. \"We also decided not to hire any additional women employees,\" he added. The watchdog noted in a statement that \"Afghanistan is celebrating International Women's Day this year at a time where security threats against journalists and media workers, especially women in the media, have intensified\". Journalists, religious scholars, activists and judges have all been victims of a recent wave of political assassinations across Afghanistan, forcing many into hiding and some to flee the country. The killings have been acutely felt by women, whose rights were crushed under Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001 -- which included a ban on them working. Intelligence officials have previously linked the attacks against women to demands at ongoing peace talks in Doha -- between the Kabul government and the Taliban -- for their rights to be protected. The attacks come as speculation is rife over America's future in Afghanistan, after the administration of President Joe Biden announced plans to review the withdrawal agreement signed with the Taliban last year that paved the way for foreign troops to leave the country by May. emh-ds/fox/leg Able to print banners, labels, photos and more, this ink-free, battery-powered device is too cool to pass up.

            "text": "  Development, Government, Local News, National Strategic PlanFebruary 6, 2018 The Grouping of Civil Society Organisations in Grenada is expressing concerns with recent publications regarding development plans for the State of Grenada An extensive report by the South China Post was published under the headline China set to move into United States\u2019 backyard with national development plan for Grenada According to the report \u201cThe Chinese foreign ministry told the South China Morning Post this month that \u201cChina Development Bank, at the request of the Grenadian government, is helping them draft a national development strategy\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d The report further states that \u201cWang Yingjie, a lead researcher involved in the drafting of the Grenada national development strategic plan had been finished recently and \u201cshould be in the hands of the Grenadian government already\u2026\u201d \u201cBeijing\u2019s blueprint envisions the construction of massive infrastructure projects which includes the construction of a highway connecting the major towns on its main island and a railway line encircling it. The plan also calls for the building of deepwater ports that could accommodate a large number of cruise and cargo ships, a large wind farm to replace diesel-fueled generators and a modernised airport with more, longer runways. It also sees a future for Grenada as an offshore tax haven for foreign companies or individuals\u2026\u201d The South China Post report claims that \u201cA China-drafted development plan for Grenada would give Chinese companies better access to future investment and infrastructure projects. The Chinese team warned in one document that the development envisioned by blueprint would not be achieved unless the Grenadian government took strong, effective measures to ensure and protect the interests of foreign investors.\u201d Civil Society members said they sought answers from the Government to the following questions \u2013 Is the implementation of Bejing\u2019s blue print already underway? And are Chinese institutions and others discussing and planning for Grenadians? The Grouping also asked government if \u00a0 work undertaken and to be undertaken on the Western Corridor Road Project, Airport loan and airport works, and the Conversions of Reserves to National Parks are part of the national development plan for Grenada. In a recent Interview on the GBN\u2019s Beyond the Headlines programme Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Dr Keith Mitchell Prime Minister Mitchell was asked about the report by Host of the Programme Lew Smith and he admitted that what they did was asked for help in developing a national development plan. \u201cAs you know Lew we were going around doing discussions internally and we asked the Chinese and they said they would prepare something \u2026 because they were the ones who took responsibility to helped us Prime Minister Mitchell said that other countries and institutions regionally and internationally were asked for assistance. \u201cBut the Chinese were the ones who accepted responsibility. We were seeking funding and the Chinese said that they were willing to provide at least a draft after consultations with persons in the country from various levels and you know we are holding discussions with rank and file persons in the country,\u201d he said.However the prime minister said that a national plan cannot be implemented without the people. \u201cAny national plan will have to be endorsed by the people of the country. So you can get advice and you can get recommendations from anybody including a government but the final decision in what sort of plan we have going forward have to be vested in the people of the country,\u201d he said. The Grenadian government announced its national strategic plan 2030 in November of 2014. Goal of the Plan as outlined by Government is to create a path toward greater national consciousness & competitiveness; greater collective responsibility for our nation\u2019s future; smarter & more effective planning for future generations; better use of our national assets & resources; empowerment of our people; development of competitive micro, small and medium sized businesses; a diversified economy built on the collective will of every citizen The 2030 is expected to build on Growth & Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS); National Strategic Plan 2007; the 2015 Strategic Plan to Modernize the Public Sector; Strategic Plans of various Ministries/Depart; and Statutory Bodies & State owned Enterprises.

            "text": " The following was published in the Loyola Phoenix by\u00a0Hannah Helbert and is reproduced here for the benefit of DNO readers: Growing influence of China easy to see half a world away in Caribbean Walking into the post office in Roseau, Dominica, I saw the usual scenes of bureaucracy I would expect anywhere around the world: drab plastic countertops, marquee ropes controlling lines and less-than-enthused employees weighing packages and filing paperwork. What I didn\u2019t expect to see was a 2010 \u201cScenery of the Great Wall\u201d calendar. This calendar was displayed prominently on the back wall of the office. My visit to the Commonwealth of Dominica (not to be confused with its Caribbean island neighbor, the Dominican Republic) coincided with the Chinese Lunar New Year. Dominica bills itself as \u201cThe Nature Island of the Caribbean,\u201d offering dramatic volcanic mountains, hot springs, rainforests and world-famous diving spots. Several parts of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies were filmed on the island. While I expected the ecological wonders I encountered, what I didn\u2019t expect was the visible evidence of Chinese investment in the country. Dominica\u2019s population hovers at approximately 70,000 and has an unemployment rate of about 23 percent. The government is trying to increase revenue through ecotourism and off-shore banking systems \u2013 and a new relationship with China. There is a highly visible Chinese presence in the area: While exploring the city, I came upon the brand-new Windsor Park Sports Stadium, which proudly displayed the sign \u201cThrough a grant from the People\u2019s Republic of China to the Government of Dominica.\u201d A new bridge project and new government buildings have just been completed by Chinese construction. Multiple Chinese restaurants, dry cleaners and import shops are visible in Roseau. These projects stem from the 2004 decision that Dominica would stop recognizing the government of The Republic of China (what is commonly called Taiwan) as the country\u2019s legitimate ruling body and instead recognize to The People\u2019s Republic of China (what is commonly referred to and recognized as China). Reports vary on how much China paid the government of Dominica for this recognition, but according to The Economist it was $122 million over five years. Both China and Taiwan have a history of using monetary incentives to earn diplomatic recognition, in countries from the Pacific to Africa. But what could China really want from a country with such a small population and economic instability? Caribbean outreach allows China to grow its influence in every region of the world. These ties allow for economic interaction and the establishment of global economic and diplomatic ties. I asked Martin, the driver of a taxi shuttle I took in Dominica, what he thought about the Chinese investment. He said he was glad the island had a new cricket stadium, so that bigger games and better teams could visit the island. He said he was unsure, however, as to why the Chinese wanted to give his island all of these things. They were far away and, from what he could tell, had no reason to have this much interest in the country. Martin went on to tell me how the Chinese projects only used Chinese workers. No Dominican men had been hired to build the bridge or stadium. Instead, all of the temporary workers had come from China, and lived in dormitories on the grounds of the new government building they were constructing. I saw these dormitories, decorated with the red banners of New Year\u2019s celebrations, and noticed that all of the signage anywhere near construction areas was in Mandarin rather than English, Dominica\u2019s official language. The construction projects had nothing to do with improving the lives of Dominicans on a personal level. Projects like the stadium would have been able to give jobs to many of the 23 percent unemployed on the island. Even the construction of the government\u2019s own buildings were undertaken by Chinese workers. These \u201cgifts\u201d were achieving little beyond aesthetic renovations, and the government of Dominica seemed fine with it. Many young people are leaving the island to seek jobs and send remittances back to their families. Martin\u2019s daughter was one of these young people. He told me she was 25 and had moved to Belize a few years ago so that she could find a job. While on the island, I visited an organic farm that tried to make up for the lack of financial opportunity on the island. Roy Ormond, the owner of Harmony Farms, wants to distill essential oils from his herbs and produce, which he could market globally, but he needs money and government support to complete these projects. He told me his daughter is currently applying for grants from USAID to purchase the equipment he needs. Roy didn\u2019t expect anything from the government of Dominica despite the millions the Chinese had given the country. As Dominica grows in popularity as a tourist destination and place to stash money into offshore accounts, there will have to be a shift eventually. Will the government cater to the policies of the Chinese in exchange for continuing funds, or will it begin to use the powerful friendship it has made to improve the lives of its people? The one souvenir I purchased in Dominica was a small flag. Featuring the Sisserou parrot, a bird native to Dominica, the flag was actually made in China but sold in a tourist market next to magnets featuring Barack Obama and reproductions of native art.

Damn fakes and spys!! @ bone I would not make such a comment. People are hearing about what is going on in all the West Indian islands. There is no doubt that she wanted to see for herself and view the scene in order to confirm it. There is a concern of the growing Chinese influence which is conspicuous. You should be concerned. Speak sense or say nothing\u2026 In my eyes, Dominica should become a French colony and should have stayed one the whole time, then none of this would\u2019ve never happened to us, we would have been better of and relied on France most of the time, instead of China and other countries basically buying Dominica. @ Anonymous I have always felt that way. Were it not for the British Dominica would still be a French Colony and would have faired better. Take note of Guadeloupe and Martinique. France is taking good care of them. Justice and Truth i agree. Is it possible for Dominica to become a French Colony? Can that happen? Because i actually want that to happen and think that this is the only say to make Dominica better off I don\u2019t speak French, or have any desire to speak French  deny her access to dominica the next time she tries to come here. @ kalos   You are so wrong! She has observed and written the truth. It is stated that the truth offends. Obviously it offends you. Face up to the fact.  The article is riddled with untruths: there ARE Dominicans working on the Roseau to Portsmouth road as well as the State House. Any journalist who is worth his/her salt would try to be neutral and make a most plausible comment, however, it seems the purpose of this article was not to shed some light from an historical perspective, as to what obtains here but rather to INSINUATE that there are underhand dealings- which in fact they may be; but the entire TONE of this piece begs numerous questions. And let us simply remember this: countries rise and fall and friends once upon a time can tomorrow be enemies. It used to be England, France, Europe, USA, Canada, etc.; today it is China so what is wrong with having relations with this country? The USA, France, Europe, Canada and the rest do have relations with it, why can\u2019t we? My own take on this issue is that Dominica\u2019s position should be as that expoused by former British Prime Minister Winston ChurchHill: England has no permanent friends nor enemies:ONLY ECONOMIC INTERESTS. What did all our former \u201cfriends\u201d give us or want from us when they became our friends? This constant bashing of our relationship with China must stop as it is not in Dominica\u2019s interest. @Kwame What is wrong? The other countries, Great Britain, U.S. , France and Canada are democratic countries. They are not there to takeover Dominica or the islands for that matter and place their conspicuous marks all over the island, making it look as if those islands are not West Indian islands but Chinese ones and belong to them. There is some selfishness in assisting DA of all. Whenever those democratic countries assist they do not send an influx of their residents to reside permanently in Dominica and to open their businesses. They may send their experts but never hundreds and soon enough, thousands of their nationals to a small country as Dominica or elsewhere in the West Indian islands. This is the problem and a serious one at that. If you are blind to this, may God help you too, open your eyes and to see the light. Pure propaganda from another AMERICAN WHITE TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are one or two issues of major global importance which get too little attention, simply because they are so complex. One of them is the uncomfortable economic stand-off between China and America, about which learned articles have rumbled on for months in the stiffer journals, read by few and understood by even fewer. Now they are snapping at each other about little bits of protectionism, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. We are all familiar with the aphorism which goes: \u201cIf you owe someone a thousand pounds, you\u2019ve got a problem. If you owe someone a million pounds, he\u2019s got a problem.\u201d Now, the US owes China two trillion dollars. Who\u2019s got the problem? In an earlier blogpost I flippantly suggested that if the US\u2019s debt to China got any bigger China would in effect \u201cown\u201d the USA. Of course this is nonsense, because China has no way of staking its claim. Should the US default on a payment, they can hardly send the bailiffs round to repossess California. Every now and then the Chinese mutter about the possibility of doing down the dollar by changing some of their reserves into yen or euros, but they don\u2019t mean it: they don\u2019t want to undermine the dollar while they\u2019re still owed so many of them. Meanwhile, the Americans grumble endlessly that the Chinese are keeping the value of their currency artificially low. It is a logical nonsense that one of the world economy\u2019s biggest players still has a currency which is not freely convertible and allowed to find its own level on the markets. But it\u2019s not exactly hard to see why the Chinese are not yet prepared to venture forth on the choppy waters of untrammelled currency speculation. Their current policy originated as a defence against the worst of the Asian financial crisis in the late 90s, and its wisdom wasn\u2019t exactly shaken by more recent events. So, to the American plea to level the terms of trade by letting the currency float, the Chinese simply say \u201cWhy should we?\u201d Well, because it\u2019s not fair in the context of free trade. But the Chinese have an all-purpose get-out: we may be a major player in absolute terms, but per capita we\u2019re still a poor developing country. So we need these little unfairnesses to help us get on level terms with you. The implication is that China won\u2019t treat the US as an equal until their per capita economies are of similar size, i.e. when China\u2019s economy is five times the size of America\u2019s. How do we get out of this double bind? We\u2019ll see if any bright @ Rightmind Simply put, there are complains about China\u2019s monopolization of currency and the economy as originated from the U.S. It does appear, given time China may one day take over the entire world. The questions we need to ask are: 1. What are we giving in return? 2. Will we be able to afford to pay the price? I am not saying that it is anything sinister but at least we should know. That is what disturbs me the most. We don\u2019t know. And it is my experience that no one gives anything for free. @ Thinking You have said it correctly. We get nothing for nothing. Something will be demanded someday. Hannah well it can\u2019t bear the USA sign if it was givin to us by China eh? Duh\u2026What is the US giving us? Gay rights? @ yes In this case you can tell the U.S. to stay away and keep their gay rights.  The U.S. now wants all U.S. religious institutions and also hospitals to offer contraception and sterilization to those who seek them as other employees to include this in their insurance plan. They have been given a mandate to comply. This is part of President Obama and his Administration\u2019s Health Care System. They have a fight on their hands for a Court Case has been lodged against the U.S. by http://www.ewtn.com citing freedom of religious rights and their conscience. This is something which I cannot wait to hear and read about. The U.S. and Great Britain governments including the United Nations want to dictate to other countries to recognize the so-called gay rights which are really homosexuality and so-called same sex marriage. Now the U.S. government is dictating to all U.S. Christian institutions to comply with its immoral mandate as previously stated. They will soon be dictating to the rest of the world as the Caribbean to do likewise. This is what happens when those countries assist smaller countries or the third world countries. They expect something from them and this something is immoral, against the Law of the land and God\u2019s Law. God is patient! It is too bad that Dominica is not self-sufficient and of course the other islands. They would not depend on foreign aid of any sort. It may be time for Dominicans to pull their weight and note what is occurring all around them and to do something about it. SEARCH HOW MUCH OF AMERICAN DEBT CHINA OWNS AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THE US GOVERNMENT IS OWING 1.2 TRILLION DOLLARS TO CHINA. SO WHAT INTREST DOES CHINA HAVE IN AMERICA TO HAVE THEM OWE SO MUCH TO CHINA? IS IT NOT THE SAME ? CHINA GIVES TO DOMINICA FOR SUPPORT AMERICA BORROWS FROM THEM FOR SUPPORT . THINK ON THIS WHAT I WANT TO ASK .WHAT INTREST DOES USA HAVE IN EGYTP THAT THEY ARE GIVING THEM 1.3 BILLION IN MILITARY AID AND MILLIONS MORE IN AID. WHY ARE THEY NOT GIVING DOMINICA THE AID THAT WE NEED ,HOW MUCH ARE THEWY INVESTIG IN THE CARRIBBEAN? THE ANWER TO INVESTMENT IS NOTHING. SO LET CHINA BE MAN . DOMINICANS DONT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE FOOLED BY THESE AMERICANS AND OTHERS WHO DONT WANT TO SEE OUR SMALL CARIBBEAN COUNTRY GROW. DO U ALL READ WORLD NEWS? DID U NOT SEE HOW MUCH INVESTMENTS CHINA HAVE WITH THE US presizely my point!!!!! all they listen is those crappy talk shows!!! ond comment on hearsay!!!! thank you uncle skerro for going to china!!! What interest does the U.S. have in Egypt? You probably meant that as a rhetorical question, but the very concrete interests are oil in the region, the Suez Canal, and a counter to the influence of Iran. Unfortunately, there really isn\u2019t much in the Caribbean, let alone Dominica, that the U.S. depends upon, and the entire population of Dominica is smaller than most towns in the U.S. So it\u2019s not that the U.S. doesn\u2019t want Dominica to grow, it\u2019s probably more that Dominica is not even on their radar. Foreign policy is selfish for a nation. Dominica too acts in its own interests on the international stage \u2013 what interest does Dominica have in choosing mainland China over Taiwan? Mainland China gives us money. The U.S. would probably give Dominica more attention only if it were to reject Castro and Chavez. this is a reasonable answer. but why should they critis us for dealing with china/ venezula and cuba when they themself have dealings with some of these nations. and just the point that i am trying to make ,we have dealings with china over taiwan because to us it makes more sense there is more to gain but we dont critisize others for their choice so we should be leftalone @ CHARLES You should use your good judgment if you have any. Recall what occurred in Egypt. The U.S. also has to protect its interests and to combat and hopefully eradicate radicals as those extremists in Egypt. This is why the U.S. assists some nations to assist in bringing about peace and, hopefully a peaceful world. All countries need help but as you will see, the U.S. will not place its mark on Egypt. It will offer assistance and will advise Egypt but it will not dominate Egypt. The U.S. is fully aware of the Chinese influence in DA and other islands. Guyana is no exception. This may be the reason if the U.S. will not assist those countries as DA. I am merely speculating. Well, I live in a community with Chinese, and I can tell you, they only stick to their own kind. I am convinced that, their interest in Dominica is not for the people, but to buy the people! Very shifty race, they are rude, and their cultural values are defintely in no line of the nature island I was once born and lived in, before migrating to North America. We can go back and forth with this, it\u2019s like the pimp feeding their workers with candy and fancy cars, but at the end, the workers must pay! My mom, always warned me, \u201cnever let someone buy you, bacause they will sell you later\u201d! @ Anonymous It is the identical situation all over North America; no exception Canada. They do not assimilate in society. This includes the Asians. They are here for themselves; they live for themselves and they see about themselves. They will love your business as a customer but this is as far as it goes. People as that are not trustworthy. You never know what they are thinking and planning. I say to all Dominicans, see about yourselves and your country without harming anyone. If it is possible to open a business, purchase land and till that land, do so. Otherwise, years from now they may be at a loss and experience the loss of their very own country. This is cause for concern. Inform the youth accordingly for they are the future adults of DA. May they attend school, study hard and well, graduate and obtain a legal paying job in DA. DA will benefit from them living a law-abiding life and a hardworking one, also for their personal benefit and that of their family. I\u2019d be rude too to someone who thought I belonged to a \u201cshifty race.\u201d It\u2019s possible that you have met some rude Chinese people, as there are rude people of every color and kind, just don\u2019t become prejudiced against all Chinese people. After all the false things people say about black people worldwide, that we\u2019re lazy, that we\u2019re stupid, that we\u2019re thieves and criminals, you\u2019d think we\u2019d be more sensitive to that same kind of racism against others. THIS IS SOME IDIOT FROM DOMINICA WRITING THIS RUBBISH..GET A LIFE AND STOP HATING ON THE CHINESE..YOU EVEN KNOW THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE? WHEN WILL YOU POLITICAL HATERS STOP? YOU ALL COMING IN ALL FORM AND CARACTOR.KEEP MAKING STUPID NOISE WHILE DOMINICA IS LOOKING TO MAKE PROGRESS D/CAN IN NY This is your opinion it does not represent that person\u2019s views and that of many others as I. Allow them due right to comment as they so please. You are given yours.  We can also say that you all, as you have computers and you cannot spell and write the English language properly.  People as you are too fresh. I know where you are coming from by your writing.  Should I say to you know your place? On Line etiquette dictates that you write in lower case. The word is \u201ccharacter.\u201d  It\u2019s always amusing when someone criticizes someone else\u2019s post in a grammatically incorrect and typo-laden post of their own. You\u2019ve also told someone that their criticism is infringing upon others\u2019 right to comment by criticizing THEIR comment. We rolling with one China all the way!  Fool this is not a gift, like the government would want you to believe. It\u2019s like bribing one to be recognized. That\u2019s very important to China\u2026 Denying Taiwan the comfort of recognition that it enjoyed for so long with it\u2019s share of bribery. These are the same people who thrive on learning how to fish instead of standing in lines waiting for someone else to bring to fish for us. We rolling with one-China!!!  I understand the deep concerns and lack of trust that emerges whenever new diplomatic relations are formed. However, how is Dominica supposed to improve? Try traveling from Roseau to Mel Ville Hall on some of those roads that were basically death traps. For decades we were the laughing stock of the Caribbean because we lacked the proper facility to host an international cricket match. Now we have the new and improved Windsor Park Stadium. Look at the shape and state of the hospital? The last improvements that were done by the French Government is filled with mold. There are and may very well be imperfections with this new relationship however, some of the improvements that we are now receiving were long overdue. As one commentator said on this site; no one can physically lift these infrastructural improvements and take them away. i agree   @ Anthony P. Ismael What happened to the funds when Dominica seceded from Great Britain and became independent? Tell me how much money did the DA government receive at that time and what happened to it? If this money was utilized properly for the people, to build roads and assist in other respects, DA would have proper roads. The government of that era neglected to utilize the funds for what it was meant for. Tell us more if you know about it and more\u2026 Let us get the facts strght, england hd us for 200yrs and she left us cranana, with nothing, she refuse to make feeder roads for the farmers that is why Patrick had to take us to independence.Eugenia plot and plot nd bring Patrick dowm with false hoods, they say sunday island was selling Domnica,instead she sell us to America, which caused the biggest brain drain in all times, and took Europe to court to destroy our banana ndustry which was our mainstay, and our cocout soap factory, when Americ finish with us, all we had was brrel industry.Now is hina turn at least after she go we will have good roads and a decent Government house, which we will rent to the next big power that come after China. So China is our friend, and the chnese can never treat us s badly s the Europeans did. @ Law and order Therefore you are insinuating that Independence brought DA nothing and was not worth it. All that fighting, burning, hatred and enmity for nothing. This must have saddened Our Lord Jesus Christ. I tend to think that this is true. DA should have remained a British Colony under any condition. It would not have the prominence of China. This includes the other West Indian islands. I am wondering if this is a punishment with more to come. Great Britain is taking note. but de tourist only bought one souvenir and she still has de nerve to mention dat. she was hardly a benefit to de country. all she came to do was mako and give ppl bad name. stupes. best she had stay where she come out wii. Nudibranch you make right! Is that we have in Dominica water! Clean mineral rich water. Chinese are no fools.I already see how they are diverting the water high up in the rivers. I have a fresh spring flowing in my land. Just now the Gov. will claim it and send it abroad! You never miss the water till the well runs dry! We got natural resources\u2026 I mean look at Beijing, It is so polluted and look at dominica. Water will be the new gold in the next couple of years, but apparently we want it now. @ Roseau They are aware that Dominica has a lot of water and clean at that. They are looking at it? They stand to benefit from it. Will DA benefit from their very own water? Wait and see. We definitely have to be careful with the Chinese and all these grants and gifts etc that we are receiving from them. You have to remember China\u2019s biggest issue is sustaining it\u2019s population.It\u2019s one of the reasons why they market their people as a resource in terms of low cost,minimum wages. This is a means of enticing foreign companies to move to China for production and manufacturing.Diplomatic relations inclusive of gifts and grants help to gain good overall acceptance of the Chinese people.The Chinese government is not stupid they know they have to diversify in terms of their trade,commerce and cheap labor force.All this would be fine under normal circumstances but considering the Chinese are extremely hard to compete with in terms of production/manufacturing it really leaves our locals at a great disadvantage.If we want most of our businesses on island to stay locally own then we must be conscious of what we are doing when we do business with foreign nations. @ Debull The Canadian Prime Minister is presently in China. He received a welcome fit for a King as seen on TV. He is also discussing Canadians who have businesses in China and others that will follow. He wants what is best for his Canadian people. It is also a matter of establishing diplomatic relations with China and for peace sake. He also discussed human rights. The democratic governments would like to see countries as China become democratic ones. China has failed when it comes to human rights. What is also beyond my comprehension, China has money to assist those countries in the Caribbean and its poor people are not well-taken care of. Married couples can only have one child. If they have another child, they will be forced to abort the child. If they hide from the government they will be found out and no doubt imprisoned and there is more. Is this a good government to do business with? Some of this information i can say i don\u2019t agree with.. If NO Dominicans were employed then who are the black men working on the construction of the new roads? .. To add to that why give Dominican men jobs when they don\u2019t want to work? Give a Dominican to construct a house they come to work @ 9 o\u2019clock and by the time it\u2019s 3 o\u2019clock they are already gone? Most of the day their time is spent not working on the houses but chit chatting and sleeping.. On the other hand give a chinese work to do by the time it is 7 o\u2019clock they are already there working up to 6 o\u2019clock in the morning. In addition, there are many Dominicans lives that have been improved; what about the houses that have been given to the many Dominicans? What about the FREE cooking gas, FREE water, FREE services etc. that have been given to the elderly? Make a check and come right back! Well if that\u2019s how we live what\u2019s the point in investing in us? That money could have been spend on making the people you are talking about better citizens by creating More education facilities for Different time of people to move at their own pace.. Dont fool yourself and think that it is free my friend! We will be paying it back for hundreds of years to come. They will tie us in an economic knot that we, for generations, will not be able to untie!!!!!!!! Think for yourself my friend, ask the questions of yourself and your leaders\u2026\u2026..look beyond the smokescreen and saveguard your country for the generations after you!!!!!!!! The Colonial masters took all what we had and plundered us, its about time we get something for free. And we should take all the loans from them to build our infrastrure and when we cannot pay just default\u2026.we will get forginess. Okay hannah lets not get carried away if you look under most everything in the united states you will see \u201cmade in china\u201d. pleasseeee people like to exaggerate. I mean clearly china has done alot for Dominica and even though i hate seeing their lions on the bridge what can you say when you get it for free? I guess if USA stop bullying people and creating unnecessary wars maybe they can donate and contribute to developing countries. Maybe then they can create their own products as well. I\u2019m just not sure what the point of this article is hannah. You can trust that the way she speaking any american reader who hasn\u2019t travelled anywhere (thats many of them by the way) going to interprete this in a way thats not representative of the facts. By the way hannah I find this sentence very out of place and insulting \u201cAs Dominica grows in popularity as a tourist destination and place to stash money into offshore accounts, there will have to be a shift eventually.\u201d Stash money seriously where\u2019s the evidence to support this? I mean I\u2019m no big fan of the government but I\u2019m a big fan of Dominica so before you go spreading lies all over the place put the facts on the table. THE NEXT PROJECT THE CHINESE ARE GOING TO GIVE US IS A NEW HOSPITAL, THEN EXPAND THE CRUISE SHIP HARBOUR EITHER IN ROSEAU OR AT WOODBRIDGE BAY. THEN THE CHINESE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT FOR NIGHT LANDING, NO MORE SLEEPING IN ANTIGUA OR ST.MAARTEN. IN MELVILLE HALL THERE WILL BE A CHINESE MILITARY BASE SO THAT CHINA WILL BE CLOSER TO NORTH AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. You were going good until you 4k it up, man  @ Anonymous Health Care in Dominica should be free. This consists of medication. I heard that medication is expensive. Those who are sick in the hospital must pay for medication at an exorbitant cost. Correct me if I was wrongly informed. it\u2019s funny that nobody is writing an article on the reparations owed to us,by our very loving friends europe and england,at this stage as far as i see china is the less of the two evils,in this economic storm we are just ridding it out,the question is,the aid that the british and there brain child america has given us,is this the reparation owed to us,oh were they just blinding us,that we remain hush hush,and do not have the bolls to demand that they pay us. Rubbish. Another attempt at detraction penned by one of the many split personalities of our very vocal friends in the local media or the diaspora. A tourist seeking to enjoy the enchantments of the nature isle would never have the time or energy to go delving so deep into local politics. Belize?? who leaves Dominica and goes to Belize?? A country blighted by levels of poverty very much unseen here in Dominica. A country close to being blacked out because government is unable to pay it\u2019s energy bills. This story is as fictitious as the name of the political scavenger who wrote it because apart from the inaccurate and misleading versions of things coming from the oppositions propaganda machine, the signs and signals are clear that 69,990 of the approximately 70,000 dominicans are very comfortable and satisfied with the new wave of development and progress taking place on island. Ask the users of the new bridge, of the new goodwill road, of the new west coast road, of the many cricket fans gearing up to witness another international fixture at the stadium\u2026\u2026.etc, etc, etc. what do we have\u2026..WATER! any village or settlement with it\u2019s own well should register the source asap. Water is more precious than oil and we are going to sell our island to feed china\u2019s booming growth. beware, Chinese don\u2019t make silly deals, somewhere someone is going to wake up and re read the small print.Then we\u2019re in trouble Dominicans should be ashamed. How many of the chines are unemployed? You all need to open your eyes to the world. Remember the saying give a man a fish he will eat for a day but teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime. All Skero is doing is giving fish. Eat da ppl. I have a feeling that the percentage of unemployed people in Dominica is higher than what is stated in the article. \u201cThey were far away and, from what he could tell, had no reason to have this much interest in the country\u201d\u2026. They want our pristine fresh water and what ever other natural resources they can get. Colonialism Part 2! Before Americans start speaking all you just jumping on their band wagon. Americans tactic to make themselves look like helpers is to instill fear in the most suttle of forms. Whilst you taking about colonialism do you remember who destroyed our banana industry? America! They talking about how they want developing countries to be on our own two feet yet they destroy everything that helps us to further our lives. They do this to back you into a corner. They want you to be reliant on them so they will have power in whatever decisions they have to make. If they see you not intimidated they will slander your name like they cuba etc etc. Please stop the non sense. Hannah\u2019s article didn\u2019t have one point! I\u2019m not sure how a bridge and a \u201cmade in china flag\u201d says chinses are taking over. I going manhattan now an dI get lots of things that have \u201cmade in china on it\u201d ..pppleassee I would have rather stay under British Rule -.- @ Just Saying: Many give you thumbs down. I gave you a \u201cthumbs up.\u201d I do agree with you. Some people do not want to face reality. Some years from now I hope they will remember what you have stated. By the time reality set in it will be too late ; they kill Pierro so that we can be where we are now Walking into the post office in Roseau, Dominica, I saw the usual scenes of bureaucracy I would expect anywhere around the world: drab plastic countertops, marquee ropes controlling lines and less-than-enthused employees weighing packages and filing paperwork. Was this written by Parry Bellot\u2026.here goes another artile talkin about pur production\u2026.WOW Go to Brooklyn and Manhattan and buy US memorabilia and when you find one that says made in the USA show it to me; go Canal Street in Manhattan and tell me who running all the businesses down there..I understand the impact that the Chinese will have on our small population, but in every corner of the world the Chines habe been present for years; why do we need foreigners to come here and make us feel inferior? When Canada gave us the Goodwill Junior High School, no one went crazy saying that our prestige was being usurped by Canada\u2026by the way when last has any of these former donor countries given usd anything tangible? We haven\u2019t got, so I doh care who give us, all I know no government cannot pack up the stadium neither the roads etc and take them away\u2026 So the people of Dominica now and generations to come will benefit and enjoy them. PJ had gotten the money for the stadium to be built in Canefield, remember even the outer walls had already been built, money was from the French gov\u2019t, what happen to that; Eugenia came in and said that a stadium was not priority\u2026so leave us the hell alone. Amen to your comment!!! Agree with u 100%!! Admin, can you post this for the rest of your readers to see. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/business/global/26bridge.html?pagewanted=all Thanks 4 dat. @wikileaks thanks very interestd article Dominicans should really check out this Article its worth reading after reading this article i hope it open some people eyes You are always on top on things. Great link, because soem Dominicans always just see oneside of everything! Thanks bud\u2026.its interesting that some might want us to believe that we are living in a coccon. I am very skeptical of writers with such leanings. If this person who wrote this lived in the US, she would have never penned such gabbage. China\u2019s influence is all over the US and is all over their economy and their congress and politics. I hope that we can leverage the Dominica-Sino relationship to the benefit of us and the greater Caribbean. Life is not about Confrontations but partnerships. Sorry! The tourist only reported as he saw it. It\u2019s left with us to evaluate the situation and recognize the impact in the long run. What I know? I\u2019m just the Lougaoo checking it out in de neck of de Grand Bay woods. A lot of this misinformation was furnished by Martin, the Dominican driver, like, no Dominicans were employed on these projects and construction of the projects have nothing to do with improving the lives of Dominicans on a personal level. check again Martin. There is a bit of misinformation. This is not what we had in mind when we ask for our independence from Britain. VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE!!          \u201cThe one souvenir I purchased in Dominica was a small flag. Featuring the Sisserou parrot, a bird native to Dominica, the flag was actually made in China but sold in a tourist market next to magnets featuring Barack Obama and reproductions of native art.\u201d When small business cry caribbean leaders and political boomboomflies think they have no rights. Leave the Chinese alone. What US visitor or European wants to take their hard earned money to go to Dominica or any Caribbean island to see Chinese let alone by inferior chinese goods, when they can get all that trash right in their home countries. Dominica is fast loosing it\u2019s stance on the world stage. They kill agriculture and boost tourism but the only people that will enjoy the tourism and expand their waistlines with fatty foods are the islanders. Stay there still Only our ppl with their small minded approach to everything are unable to see the true lack of real economic impact of this chinese aesthetic investments in our country. I guess when you dependent on others for handouts you always have to be in a \u201cTake whatever you get mode\u201d, and people consider you ungrateful if you think its not what we deserve. But rather its the beggars attitude of accepting scraps/ and being thankful for it, because they are not willing to put in the effort or have the gull to achieve for themselves what they truely deserve Beggars are no choosers\u2026 Even america gets hand outs. If the recession didn\u2019t teach you that then gosh all you really under a rock. it is part of stamp collection philatelic inform yourself Thanks you for your observation on what is happening with the chinese nvestments inDominica. I am very surprised that the native is not being employed as they need work. The government should not allow the Chinese to bring over their workers and not employed natives as they need to learn a trade and earn money to survive. what does Mrtin mean when no Dominicans were and are employed in Chinese funded projects? The beautiful highways we have national working on them as well. If Dominica is giving a gift to another island in the form of infrastructure then Dominica must be given the right to send it\u2019s people to that country to work as well. What about our farmers who go to canada to harvest fruits i mean, the Canadians who have no jobs could refute that as well. I believe that our people are very lazy, we don\u2019t get the job done, we linger and complain about salaries. Most of our hearts are not directed to the country but to ourselves. true I didn\u2019t know farmers from dominica going Canada to harvest fruits. That\u2019s good!! We getting to host Australia because of them. Im starting to really wonder now are we an independent country, or are we becoming colonized once again? We Independent enough to decide for ourself, who we should and should not deal with and on what level. pOLICALLY WE ARE, ECONOMICALLY \u2026NOT Admin u have basically copied and paste the whole article so y put the link like there is more to the article than what u have already written for us to read\u2026\u2026\u2026please don\u2019t do that makes no sense cause am going to the link thinking that you just summarized and whereas you copied it making me waste my time Please do not delete ADMIN: We put the link there so readers can see the article actually exists and we did not make it up.

A projection published by broadcaster SRF showed the trade agreement had support at 51% after a poll last month had suggested it would pass by a narrow margin. Voters are getting a say because after environmentalists argued the trade agreement lets palm-oil producers off the hook too easily. Final results for both measures are expected later on Sunday. Indonesia is the world\u2019s biggest producer of the oil -- used in everything from chocolate to shampoo -- and the trade deal would reduce tariffs on imports of certified sustainable production. While the Swiss government argued the deal would help sustainable production, members of the Green Party and other activists said sustainability labels for palm oil aren\u2019t credible and that practices that hurt the environment won\u2019t be stopped. The proposal to ban face coverings is designed to forbid Islamic full-face veils. SRF said the projection showed support at 51%. It\u2019s been spearheaded by a group close to the anti-immigrant Swiss People\u2019s Party, which in 2009 successfully pushed through a national ban on the construction of minarets. Austria and France have already enacted similar laws. Women\u2019s groups and the Social Democrats campaigned against the proposed ban on face coverings, saying it\u2019s discriminatory. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

Secret Birria serves birria ramen, tacos and more.  {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. Secret Birria, a taco spot which opened in November in Uptown, isn\u2019t on a main drag. You have to know it\u2019s there, because it would be easy to pass right by the storefront windows looking in on a kitchen and service counter. Secret Birria offers counter service and outside seating in the adjacent driveway, with food delivered through a side window. The compact menu hangs its hat on birria tacos, the now-trending traditional tacos that are typically made with slow-stewed beef, simmered with guajillo and ancho chiles into an oily, fragrant pool of flavorful shredded meat. Super popular in cities including Los Angeles, San Antonio and Houston, birria tacos have been blowing up on social media. A quick check on Instagram has more than 244,000 #birria posts, with 115,000 birria-based videos running rampant on TikTok.\u00a0 Yes, they are that good. Super juicy, a scoop of the chili-infused meat is griddled with plenty of cheese in between corn tortillas, and they are served with a bowl of broth for dipping. There are many versions of the specialty, which hails from Jalisco, in western Mexico. The family-style stew is made with beef, goat or lamb.\u00a0They have been popularized locally at places like chef Will Avelar\u2019s Mawi Tortillas. Alex Caluda manages Secret Birria, whose owner prefers to stay out of the spotlight \u2014 though the building is owned by Darryl Reginelli, the local restaurateur who founded Reginelli\u2019s Pizzeria in 1996. According to Caluda, the owner fell in love with birria tacos in Mexico, and with a help of a friend there, came up with the idea of having his own birria taco joint in New Orleans. \u201cThe people behind this like the idea of a secret masked luchador (wrestler) being the restaurant\u2019s face,\u201d Caluda says. One of the trademark wrestling masks is on the counter where walk-in customers place their orders. Caluda wasn\u2019t familiar with birria tacos before he opened the restaurant, but he\u2019s learned fast. \u201cWe use Angus chuck beef and marinate it overnight in a base of fresh peppers and seasoning,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next day we cook it for at least five hours, which makes it so flavorful.\u201d Tacos are grilled in flour, not corn tortillas, filled with the shredded beef mix, onion and cilantro. Tacos are available in trios for $12, or solo for $4. A \u201cbirriarito\u201d is a burrito made with birria beef, rice, beans, pepper sauce, white queso, fresh onion and cilantro, and dipping sauce is served on the side. Birria ramen is another specialty, and it is exactly what it sounds like: a soupy bowl of ramen noodles swimming in the birria jus with meat, onion and cilantro for $8.75 a bowl. It\u2019s reminiscent of yakamein but not as spicy.  PoLa New Orleans is at Broad Street Cider every Friday and offers precooked, packaged meals on the second and fourth Sunday of the month.  If beef isn\u2019t your thing, there are a few other options. A chicken burrito is made with shredded chicken, rice, beans and slaw tossed with salsa negra, shredded mozzarella, fresh onion and cilantro. The fried fish tacos are stellar. Crispy battered Gulf fish \u2014 usually sheepshead, which comes in fresh most days \u2014 is garnished with shredded cabbage, drizzled with chipotle relish and served on a flour tortilla. House-fried Cajun cracklings are served with queso for dipping. Sides include queso, roasted shishito peppers and rice and beans. The restaurant doesn\u2019t have a liquor license or a plan to get one. Instead, the options are strawberry-, pineapple- and orange-flavored Fantas and Mexican Cokes made with Mexican cane sugar. Secret Birria is a casual neighborhood place, with a bench out front for customers waiting for take-out orders and a smattering of outside tables on the side of the building.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re definitely catching on,\u201d Caluda says. \u201cThe neighborhood crowd is growing.\u201d 323 Octavia St., (504) 899-2961 4 p.m.-9 p.m. Thursday-Sunday Limited outdoor seating and takeout Rosalita\u2019s Backyard Tacos may be the only taco joint named for an alley.

            "text": " On Assignment For HuffPost Bent Not Broken is a look back on the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has disrupted our mental health, plus advice on how to manage our well-being moving forward. The pandemic has transformed how we think and talk about mental health, particularly as more people have developed chronic stress, anxiety and other issues over the last year. Of the more than 500,000 people who took a depression screening between March and September 2020, around 8 in 10 people scored with symptoms of moderate to severe depression, according to a 2021 report released by Mental Health America. The survey also found that more participants reported frequent thoughts of self-harm or suicide, and symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety. Further, research has shown that the pandemic has greatly affected the mental health of communities across the globe, including frontline health workers and COVID-19 survivors. \u201cEven if you have managed to keep your jobs and relationships intact, and have not previously had a mental health diagnosis, there are still many challenges to maintaining good emotional regulation when there is such uncertainty about the future,\u201d said Noel Bell, a psychotherapist and a spokesperson for the U.K. Council for Psychotherapy. Circumstances such as isolating lockdowns and job insecurity have contributed to the emotional toll of the pandemic. Yet, not everyone reacts to stressful circumstances in the same way. HuffPost spoke with 12 people about how their mental health has changed during the pandemic, at times in surprising ways. (Note: Some people requested to withhold their last names in order to speak freely about their mental health or personal situations.) Jordan Stumph, 25, a community outreach coordinator, said the health restrictions put into place over the past year not only seemed to exacerbate symptoms of her bipolar disorder, but they also triggered new health issues and fears of being near people.  \u201cDuring the pandemic, I was also diagnosed with [complex] PTSD and have started treatment for anxiety,\u201d Stumph said. \u201cObviously, these were things that had been hanging out in the back of my mind for a long time, but the pandemic just amplified it.\u201d \u201cI feel like my mental health has improved because I\u2019ve had more time to work at it. I have had depression and anxiety since my early adulthood, and always brushed it under the rug. Now, I\u2019ve been able to focus on myself and create self-care regimens that help quell my anxiety and depression,\u201d said Shanelle McKenzie, 33, co-founder of the wellness community The Villij. \u201cMy hope above all is to be able to work from home much more than I did in the past to help keep this all up.\u201d As someone living with depression and an eating disorder, Francesca Baker, 33, worried that the lockdowns would worsen her mental health. Instead, the pandemic has given her more time to focus on habits and routines \u2014 such as meal planning \u2014 that supported her recovery.  \u201cI used to fill my time with activities because I couldn\u2019t bear to feel. That\u2019s been harder [to do] in lockdown, but it\u2019s actually been OK,\u201d said Baker, a copywriter and marketer. \u201cI\u2019ve become more at ease with downtime, which is much better for my well-being.\u201d \u201cIn the beginning of the pandemic, my anxiety levels went through the roof, but it wasn\u2019t anything I couldn\u2019t handle with my coping mechanisms that I had worked out in therapy. However, the unpredictability of the whole situation has really started to take its toll on my mental health toward the end of last year,\u201d said Babett K\u00fcrschner, a 23-year-old public relations student. Over the past few months, K\u00fcrschner has gotten creative in finding coping strategies to deal with the new waves of heightened anxiety. While she hopes her anxiety levels will return to baseline once people are allowed to safely engage in more activities, she also hopes her \u201cnew outlook on dealing with uncertainty is here to stay.\u201d The pandemic swiftly changed Katie Hull\u2019s day-to-day life as a 27-year-old student at the University of Sunderland in England, which has affected her mental health.  \u201cI was very accustomed to living my life in a certain way. I enjoyed attending university classes, but this was taken away. I find myself regularly in a room staring at the same walls,\u201d Hull said. \u201cI do not think that we will ever return to the normalization of January 2020. We have to remember that millions of people have died, and I doubt anyone wants to go through another 12 months of heartbreak.\u201d For Jennifer, 42, who is self-employed, the past year has actually had a positive impact on some aspects of her mental health. In particular, it has alleviated some anxiety around relationships with her relatives.  \u201cThe pandemic has taken the pressure off me to show up to family functions, which has reduced the anxiety around having to constantly defend my boundaries,\u201d she said. Hailey F., a 30-year-old artist, said her mental health has both improved and worsened throughout the pandemic.  \u201cI was let go from my job, and having extra time to deal with my ups and downs has made it easier,\u201d she said. \u201cIt got worse because I was unsure of how bad this virus was going to be, and honestly having Donald Trump as a president was like being in an abusive relationship. The ups and downs of financial instability made things worse as well.\u201d  \u201cI already suffered with anxiety and low mood before the pandemic, but it has gotten worse since the first lockdown,\u201d said Megan Laura Harris, a 19-year-old undergraduate student, adding that she had to reach out for mental health help. \u201cThe restrictions have really affected me, and I believe that this will stay with me after the pandemic has ended. I am already frightened of going outside. I\u2019m afraid of going to see other people in case I catch COVID.\u201d Harris said listening to music and going for daily walks has helped her cope over the past year. Like the majority of graduating college students in 2020, 22-year-old freelance journalist Lexi Shannon was unable to celebrate her achievement and entered a competitive job market.  \u201cI felt that my past four years of undergrad were inevitably leading me down a dead end, which took a huge toll on my mental health. I was already dealing with the stress and pressure of graduating from college, and being thrown into an industry with no open jobs made it hard for me to look at my future in a positive light,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that once things start to return to the new normal, I\u2019ll look at things that I took for granted in a new light and use that to help me grow mentally.\u201d \u201cIn March 2020, I was about to find queer and trans community for the first time in my four decades, just when my schedule was going to free up. The global pandemic hitting the USA stopped that,\u201d said Em Rabelais, 42. \u201cI spent most of the pandemic living alone.\u201d \u201cLast week after waiting two weeks after my second COVID vaccine dose, I was able to pod in with a friend,\u201d Rabelais continued. \u201cWhile this is helpful, 10 months of increasing daily trauma from isolation and aloneness has been culminating this winter in ways that I\u2019ll need to work through for years.\u201d Sheena Yap Chan, 39, said she struggled to cope in the first few months of the pandemic, and ended up spending much of her time doomscrolling through the news cycle. However, she explained her mental health began to improve over the summer as she utilized her platform to build a community for others in need of extra support. \u201cI create Clubhouse chat rooms where people can express their issues of mental health and bring awareness about the topic of mental health because it\u2019s still a stigma in so many cultures,\u201d said Yap Chan, an author and podcaster on building self-confidence. \u201cJust by creating a safe space where you can share your mental health challenges can also be a healing process. You feel a lot better because you realize you are not the only one going through this.\u201d  \u201cI was working in hospitality marketing, facing some really tough challenges during the lockdown. I was overworked, tired and dealing with a lot of personal pressures,\u201d said Chloe Tomalin, 25, a marketing and branding consultant. She left her job and sought acute treatment for her mental health. \u201cI\u2019ve been journaling throughout my mental health breakdown and my recovery, which has allowed me to gain more clarity and focus,\u201d Tomalin said. \u201cThe pandemic has also allowed me to have time to reflect on my personal and professional development without the pressure of FOMO.\u201d If you do find yourself becoming increasingly anxious, depressed, or withdrawn from your daily activities, \u201cit is important to seek help, and not to think that your problem is not serious enough,\u201d said Bell, the spokesperson for the U.K. Council for Psychotherapy. It may have been just over a year since most major cities around the world went into their first lockdowns, but people are still trying to figure out how to cope with pandemic-related stress. After all, there is no mental health guidebook to living through this kind of global health crisis. So practicing a little self-compassion can go a long way in protecting your mental health during unpredictable times.  On Assignment For HuffPost"

Former president Rafael Correa announced a total of eight new hydropower plants slated to become operational in 2016 at a total cost of some US$6 billion. Jorge Glas, then minister of strategic sectors, who in 2017 was jailed as part of the continent-wide corruption scandal involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, was responsible for the master plan. Only the Odebrecht-built Manduriacu plant, however, was inaugurated on schedule in 2015. The other seven projects \u2013 either partially or wholly owned by Chinese contractors \u2013 have missed deadlines due to engineering and environmental problems. In total, accidents resulted in the death of some 26 workers, both Ecuadorean and Chinese. Ecuador banked on the hydro sector to generate its own energy as well as a surplus to sell to neighbouring countries. The damage, operational delays and accidents have compromised the country\u2019s ability to repay the Chinese creditors financing construction of these projects. The construction of Coca Codo Sinclair is an immense obstacle to achieving a truly clean energy matrix in Ecuador Today, only four of those seven projects function. They operate at almost their installed capacity, producing some 2,422 megawatts (MW), according to the Electricity Regulation and Control Agency (ARCONEL).  Ecuador\u2019s hydroelectric plants seek to transform the country\u2019s electricity grid, which until now has depended on coal-fired thermoelectric plants. Its commitment to increase the share of hydropower, up 35% with these projects, allows the country to significantly reduce its emissions of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change and meet its commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Coca Codo Sinclair (CCS), Ecuador's largest hydroelectric plant, which was due to begin operations in 2012, has experienced financing problems, strikes by workers demanding better conditions from contractor Sinohydro, and accidents such as the December 2014 collapse of a pressure well that claimed 14 lives. \u2028\u2028The plant, eventually inaugurated at the beginning of 2016, has visible fissures in its water distributors, owing to the use of unsuitable materials, according to a report by the Comptroller's Office.  According to Ecuador\u2019s Electricity Corporation (Celec), which will operate the plant, repair work at CCS will last approximately one year and the costs will be borne by the contractor. \u201cEcuador will definitively not take over the plant until all the works permitting Coca Codo Sinclair to operate normally have been carried out,\u201d Celec wrote in an email to Di\u00e1logo Chino. In the case of the three plants that comprise the Mazar Dudas complex, only Alaz\u00e1n is operating. In 2015, Celec unilaterally terminated the construction contract with China National Electric Engineering Company (CNEEC) for non-compliance. According to the most recent data on Celec's website, construction of the engine room and the electromechanical assembly of the second San Antonio power plant were planned for 2018. Re-engineering studies for the third Dudas power plant were also scheduled for 2018. the moment you enter with the drilling machinery in hand, you are hit with the reality of the rock itself The Quijos project also experienced problems due CNEEC\u2019s non-compliance with technical standards, according to Celec documents. This led Celec to terminate the contract in December 2015. There is currently a mediation process underway between the state attorney's office and the Chinese firm. In an emergency declaration, Celec ended up awarding the assigning works to local company Proyaben S.A. in 2016 and 2017.  \u201cThey couldn\u2019t make any progress as there were geological problems. No matter how many studies you do, the studies are merely superficial,\u201d said Marco Valencia, undersecretary for Electricity Generation and Transmission at Ecuador\u2019s energy ministry. \u201cGeophysical and geological analyses may be carried out, but the moment you enter with the drilling machinery in hand, you are hit with the reality of the rock itself. In those two projects [Mazar Dudas and Quijos], we encountered geological problems like these, and the contractor could not fulfil their obligations.\u201d The Toachi Pilat\u00f3n project is also in a state of paralysis. Its facilities were 85.4% ahead of schedule, according to Celec's 2018 stocktake. In this phase, several foreign companies were involved, including Odebrecht, which was later expelled from the country by the government.  In 2010, Celec hired China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWEC) for the civil construction and the Russian Inter RAO UES to supply electromechanical equipment. Faced with constant delays, Correa ordered the termination of the builders' contract in December 2016. After one-and-a-half years with no progress, on 22 May 2018 Russian contractor Tyazhmash S.A. was awarded the contract to complete works. In 2018, Ecuador produced approximately 23,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh), most of which powered the country's homes, industries and public buildings. Hydropower generated 85% of that energy, according to Valencia.  With the new hydroelectric plants in operation, Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s government has provided assurances that carbon dioxide CO2 emissions will be reduced, due to the decrease in the consumption of fossil fuels in the thermoelectric plants. \u201cSince they began operating, each year we have seen a reduction of 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide,\u201d Valencia said. According to the undersecretary, in 2014 and 2015 \u2013 the years with the highest thermoelectric production \u2013 Ecuador emitted an estimated 6 million tonnes of CO2. In 2016, this fell to 5 million. Today, the figure is between 1.5 and 2 million tonnes. However, the overall balance may not be so positive since the construction of hydropower plants has considerable environmental impacts, which, as figures for many of the projects show, also have big economic costs. They have also led to energy overproduction, which is difficult to correct, according to Paulina Garz\u00f3n of the China-Latin America Sustainable Investment Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s politically and economically non-viable for any Ecuadorean government to undertake genuinely clean energy projects such as wind or solar when it already has excess energy production and an onerous debt to repay,\u201d said Garz\u00f3n, who authored a book chapter on the projects and the loans that made them possible. \u201cThe construction of Coca Codo Sinclair is an immense obstacle to achieving a truly clean energy matrix in Ecuador,\u201d she added.  Furthermore, since its 2008 default, Ecuador has not had access to international capital markets, leading Correa\u2019s government to agree loan packages with China that are repaid with oil sales. As global crude prices slumped, Ecuador had to pump more oil in order to meet repayment obligations, calling into question both the economic and environmental sustainability of the model. For Arturo Villavicencio, professor of ecological economics and energy at the Andean University, developing hydroelectricity was the best alternative for changing the energy matrix, but not at such magnitude. \u201cThe reasonable thing would have been to select smaller projects, where the national contribution could have been greater,\u201d said Villavicencio, who was also a\u00a0former member of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  \u201cThat would have allowed the metal-mechanic industry to develop more; a great opportunity for national technological development was wasted and we would not have had the Chinese making all projects turnkey,\u201d added Villavicencio, in reference to the type of contract that affords decision-making power on works to the financier. Part of the problem, Villavicencio said, is that many companies were not prepared to sort out the technical problems they found and that the Ecuadorean government has been unable to monitor their work. Furthermore, although there are several construction problems in need of monitoring in the remaining dams, Villavicencio warned that Ecuador will fail to reap the benefits of hydropower if the country does not improve supervision of rivers that feed into the system. \n            You can republish our articles for free under the Creative Commons licence.\n           \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Impacts and innovations in a key sector for China and Latin America  Mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to cleaner economies   Natural resources and responsible extraction   Bridging Latin America's infrastructure gap sustainably   The drivers, actors and institutions behind the billions  Follow A chinadialogue partner site.\nFind out more\n Dialogo Chino uses cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Reuters Staff 2 Min Read DUBAI/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma have tested positive for COVID-19 after showing minor symptoms, his office said on Monday. The Syrian leader and his spouse, who announced her recovery from breast cancer in 2019, were in good health and would keep working in isolation at home, the statement said. Syria has seen a sharp rise in infections since mid-February, a member of the government\u2019s coronavirus advisory committee told Reuters last week as the country kicked off its vaccination campaign. Health and aid officials say it remains difficult to gauge the full size of the outbreak given the lack of testing facilities in a fragile health system devastated by a decade of war. As of Sunday, the health ministry reported 10,374 infections and 1,063 related deaths out of a population of around 18 million. Assad joins a growing list of world leaders who have tested positive for COVID-19, alongside Britain\u2019s Boris Johnson, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and former U.S. President Donald Trump. Health workers said the authorities underplayed the size of the outbreak for most of last year, when official figures remained low as hospitals were overwhelmed and death notices appeared in newspapers. The government denied undercounting the figures and has acknowledged in the last two months the country could be on the verge of a major spike. It has urged people to wear face masks, take sanitary measures and avoid crowded areas. Officials and businessmen say the sanctions-hit government can ill afford a full lockdown given the dire state of the economy and growing poverty. After a decade of war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and uprooted millions, Assad\u2019s military has reclaimed most of the country with Russia and Iran\u2019s help.

The tax will cover most everyone who rents primarily in the summer in the municipality. Mayor Janice Jackson says most municipalities charge accommodation taxes and South Bruce Peninsula is looking at a 4% surcharge beginning this summer. Jackson says 2% of the revenue will go into the tourism budget and 2% will be used to help enhance recreational sites in the community. The mayor states, \u201cThe municipal accommodation tax will also be applicable to private cottage rentals as well like Airbnb\u2019s, and because they are not commercial entities, they are going to be licenced by the town.\u201d Those that pay commercial taxes will be exempt from the licence fee but for the other rentals there will be a reasonable licence fee that will be applied each year, over and above the 4% surcharge they will be charging their customers. The cost of the licence fee is not known at this time but Mayor Jackson says it will not be \u201cpunitive.\u201d She says they want to better control the private cottage rental industry because over the last few years, they\u2019ve been getting a lot of complaints about income properties and having renters that are noisy and careless. Council directed that the necessary by-law to establish a municipal accommodation tax be placed on an upcoming Council agenda for consideration. The by-law which will be considered will not include campgrounds; this means that campgrounds will be exempt from municipal accommodation taxes. 18.2\u00b0C Mostly CloudyWind: SW 6 km/h Observed at: Wiarton AirportLast updated: Friday October 15, 2021 at 14:00 EDTSource: Environment and Climate Change Canada (license)"

            "text": " Voice of America08 Mar 2021, 18:35 GMT+10 LONDON - It's almost a year since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The Middle East was one of the first regions to be hit outside China, and the pandemic has exacerbated existing crises caused by conflict and forced migration. Iran recorded its first coronavirus infections in February 2020, one of the first outbreaks outside Wuhan. Within days it had become a global epicenter as hospitals filled with patients. Iranian government figures suggest 60,000 people have died since the outbreak began but the true number is likely far higher, says Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Washington-based Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit focusing on foreign policy and security. He believes early mistakes by the government cost lives. \"You saw them first deny it, then downplay it,\" Taleblu told VOA. \"The challenge is that the health and welfare of its own people is not priority No. 1. And when you're facing a global pandemic, that means your citizens are going to bear the brunt of it.\" Iran insists it did all it could to contain the outbreak and denied accusations that it covered up the true number of deaths. By the time the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic on March 11, the virus had spread across the Middle East. In Yemen and Syria, countries racked by deep-rooted conflicts, the pandemic compounded the pressure on fragile health systems. In May, the United Nations warned that the Yemeni health system, which was already severely weakened by years of fighting, had essentially collapsed.

The festival of Eid al-Fitr in May, the end of Ramadan, was marked with somber, socially distanced worship across the Muslim world. In Lebanon, economic and political crises compounded by the pandemic and exacerbated by the August explosion in Beirut port, pushed the country to the brink. By September there were worsening outbreaks in several refugee camps in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. As third waves of the pandemic gripped Europe, the United States and Latin America at the end of 2020, the Middle East fared better than the World Health Organization had feared - but it warns the situation remains precarious. \"Around 6 million people in the region caught the virus\" since the beginning of the pandemic, said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the World Health Organization's Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, in a press conference last month. \"Unfortunately, around 140,000 people died,\" he added. \"In our region, where people and healthcare institutions suffer constantly with war, natural disasters and diseases, this virus has demanded all our efforts.\" That effort is now being directed toward vaccinations. Israel has rolled out the fastest mass vaccination program in the world as over half the population has received a first dose. The country began gradually lifting its coronavirus lockdown measures last month, with services such as hair salons and gyms allowed to reopen. Early data suggests the vaccination program is helping to curb the spread of the virus. Dr. Peter Drobac, a global health expert at the University of Oxford, says early planning was key. \"No. 1, they did some things right in terms of purchasing agreements and getting early access to the vaccines,\" Drobac told VOA. \"But really this is all about operations and organization.\" Vaccination rates vary sharply across the Middle East. The Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza lag far behind Israel. The United Nations says Israel should provide vaccines under international law; the Israeli government says healthcare is the responsibility of the Palestinian Authority, under the 1993 Oslo Accords. Many countries in the region are using Chinese and Russian-made vaccines and are hoping to benefit from the global COVAX program which provides vaccines to low- and middle-income nations. Deliveries of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccine under the program began last month. Iran remains the worst-hit country in the region. Last month Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for stricter border controls, warning that another wave of the pandemic could hit the country. \"More attention must be paid to foreign entries, especially from countries infected with new variants of the virus,\" Rouhani said Feb. 13 in a meeting of the national anti-COVID-19 headquarters in Tehran. The World Health Organization is urging countries to remain vigilant, as the new virus mutations could be more infectious and resistant to vaccines. These content links are provided by Content.ad.

Located at the southwestern part of the Gulf of Mexico, the project included dozens of sub-divisional works such as a more than 400,000 sq m storage yard, a heavy container zone, a refrigerated container zone and structural layers consisting of a PV zone, empty container areas and a housing project, as well as the water and electricity programs. The port is the highest-valued among infrastructure construction projects Chinese enterprises have contracted in Mexico in recent years. Generally contracted by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC) and built by CCCC Third Harbor Engineering Co., Ltd., both subsidiaries of China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), the project is expected to evolve into the second largest port in the country when it is completely constructed.

            "text": " Breast cancer survivor Donia Youssef got 50 Bunchems toys stuck in her hair after letting her kids 'play hairdressers' - and spent a full 22 hours trying to get them out Subscribe today to get the latest Coventry Live headlines straight to your inbox with our free email updates A mum who has just spent two years growing her hair back following chemo feared she would have to chop it all back off after her mischievous daughters got 'about 50' Bunchems toys tangled in her 'precious' locks. Breast cancer survivor Donia Youssef thought nothing of letting her little girls Aaliyah, eight, and Tiana Youssef-Thomas, five, 'play hairdressers' with her long locks on Tuesday night. However, relaxation soon turned to horror when a panicked Aaliyah shouted that the plastic balls had become stuck in her 42-year-old mum's hair and would not come out despite her tugging on them desperately. The author and company director urged her kids not to panic and put them to bed, but soon realised the coloured balls were completely 'matted' in her locks. Donia then spent 22 hours trying to get the Bunchems out of her hair - unable to sleep as a spiky crown had formed across her hairline. Eventually, the stressed mum was freed, but not before losing large clumps of the hair she had waited so long to grow. Now she is calling for the toys to be banned while urging other parents not to buy the toys or to throw them out if they already have. Donia, from Grays, Essex, said: \"It was horrendous. There were about 50 in there. \"[Bunchems] should be banned. I lost all my hair because of chemotherapy so this to me is an absolute nightmare. \"I thought I'd have to cut the things out. It's taken me two years to grow my hair long again from being bald. \"I've been up since 3am this morning trying to get them out. I was worried. \"There was a lot of hair coming out because unfortunately it was all wrapped around the balls. \"It's not great and especially for me, my hair is really precious. I've spent all this time growing it. \"They're going in the bin. My message to parents is get rid of them, straight away. Get rid of them. \"They are banned from my household and should be banned full stop.\" Donia had initially told her girls not to panic but as she tried to take control and remove them herself, she realised to Bunchems were not budging. Over the course of the evening, she tried to get them out with oil and even soaked her hair in the bath, hoping the water would help it separate and release the toys. Donia, who has been in remission since January 2018, said: \"I was trying to juggle schoolchildren and working life. I was trying to keep the children quiet for 10 minutes and they said 'can we play hairdressers?' \"I didn't even know what Bunchems were. The little one, five, had all different colours of these things. \"She said 'Mummy, can I put them in your hair' and I said 'yes of course', thinking they were hair accessories. \"They must have been given them for a party or birthday present. \"I'm sat there and the next minute the eldest starts panicking saying 'Mummy, Mummy, they're not going to come out'. \"I said 'don't panic'. She was getting so worked up. But the next minute I thought 'oh my god, they won't come out'. \"She was more worried than me. I've obviously been through cancer and lost my hair. \"I had to sleep in them all night which obviously weren't very comfortable. They were all at the front of my hair so I can't even chop it out. \"I bathed this morning to try and see if [the matted hair] would separate by lying with my hair down in the water, but no. \"I said [to the girls] 'don't worry, we've got Ebby, the hairdresser down the road'. She's a friend.\" In a panic, Donia then called Ebby Ijomoni, 31, who came over with conditioner and detangler and stayed for five hours patiently unravelling hair from each piece. After using the hair products, Ebby was able to remove every piece - but sadly pulled out huge clumps of Donia's hair in the process. Donia said: \"The problem is you put the [Bunchems] in your hair, then they weirdly start attracted each other, then they all lock up and it's a big, matted mess. \"My friend has a huge bottle of conditioner, detangle spray and a bottle of water. The comb broke too. \"My children are mixed race, so they've got Afro-Caribbean hair. If it got in their hair - good god. Their hair is a nightmare as it is to manage. \"My hair is European hair but it's still an absolute nightmare. I was going to chop it off last night because I couldn't sleep on it properly. \"My hairdresser came to the rescue, so sorry covid, we [had] an actual emergency here. \"I need to complain to [Bunchems manufacturer] and send the hairdresser's bill. \"I've got to go to the hospital in a couple of days and [I feared I'd] have to walk out in public with them in.\" A spokesperson for the toy manufacturer Spin Master, who launched Bunchems in 2015, said: \"We express our sincere apologies for the inconvenience this has caused for both her and her children. \"While the packaging clearly indicates that Bunchems should be kept away from hair, we recognize that accidents like this may happen. \"We are no longer producing this item and any product still on shelf are through third-party sellers. \"We encourage parents who may have the item in their home to read the directions carefully and leverage our online resources to help guide play with the product.\" "

            "text": "   By Joyce M. Rosenberg, The Associated Press Posted Mar 8, 2021 8:06 am EDT Last Updated Mar 8, 2021 at 8:14 am EDT NEW YORK \u2014 They\u2019re just your regular neighbourhood pharmacists, but some now wear superhero capes. Local pharmacy owners are filling in the gaps as federal, state and county authorities across the country struggle to ramp up vaccinations vital to crushing the COVID-19 pandemic. In some small towns across the U.S., an independent pharmacy is the only local place where residents can get a COVID-19 vaccination. President Joe Biden recently celebrated the injection of the 50 millionth dose of COVID-19 vaccine since his inauguration. But the huge undertaking has been hampered by vaccine shortages and concerns whether marginalized communities are getting access to shots. The hope is that local pharmacies will now play a key role in getting more Americans inoculated. They have become vaccine providers by applying to state health officials and the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination, which has been distributing vaccine to networks of independently owned pharmacies, as well as the big national chains. The Biden administration\u2019s coronavirus co-ordinator, Jeff Zients, said at the start of the program last month about 6,500 pharmacies would receive a total of 1 million doses, with more pharmacies joining the program as vaccine production increases. The program doesn\u2019t fully fill the gaps, however \u2014 more than 400 rural counties lack a retail pharmacy that\u2019s included in the partnership. Giving vaccinations requires long hours and administrative work, and there\u2019s little or no money in it for pharmacy owners. They don\u2019t have to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine, unlike flu and other vaccines, but they do have administrative costs they may be able to recover when patients have insurance. Still, the money is not their immediate concern. Adam Bayer and his wife have given out shots at their store, Hillcrest Pharmacy in Vernon, Texas. The work can be intense \u2014 the first batch of 100 doses took them a day and a half to administer. Besides giving the vaccine, they must monitor patients for 15 minutes for signs of allergic reactions. Bayer applied to become a vaccine provider because he believed he was in a position to help fight the pandemic. He\u2019s been proactive and reaching out to customers. \u201cWe\u2019re calling patients who we know aren\u2019t online,\u201d he says. \u201cMy prayer is that we\u2019re not leaving people behind.\u201d Good Neighbor Pharmacy, one of the networks whose members are participating in the Federal Retail Pharmacy program, has so far been allotted 75,000 doses for pharmacies in Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Texas and Guam, says Jenni Zilka, a senior vice-president at the network. Those doses began arriving the week of Feb. 11. All told, the Federal Retail Pharmacy program has 21 companies taking part including big drugstore and grocery chains and mass merchandisers like Costco and Walmart. However, not all the big chains like CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreen\u2019s are giving out vaccinations in every state they\u2019re located in. The program is giving a boost to the independents that have been losing ground to the nationwide retailers for decades. In 2015, independents accounted for 36% of the 61,000 pharmacies across the U.S., according to the National Community Pharmacists Association, a trade group. By 2019, they accounted for 35% as the number of pharmacies overall grew to 61,480. Pharmacists who get a smile and a nod when customers pick up routine prescriptions are now being greeted by applause and tears from customers, first responders and residents of assisted-living centres in communities across the country. The pharmacists themselves are equally emotional. \u201cThe opportunity to call someone who\u2019s 85 and tell them, \u2018I\u2019m going to give you a vaccine\u2019 is a pretty profound experience,\u201d says Chris Antypas, co-owner of Asti\u2019s South Hills Pharmacy in Pittsburgh, which has given out several hundred doses. Besides giving COVID-19 shots in their stores, pharmacists have also set up mass immunization clinics. They\u2019re already experienced at giving out shots \u2014 for years they\u2019ve administered flu, pneumonia, shingles and other vaccinations. But they\u2019re required to get additional training before they can give out COVID-19 shots: They must learn how to handle and store the vaccine, and unlike with other immunizations, they must report to health officials who gets the vaccines, and the name of each dose\u2019s manufacturer. Matt Hopp owns what\u2019s known as a closed-door pharmacy \u2014 it specializes in packaging and delivering medication for assisted-living facilities and nursing homes in the Atlanta area. So far, Guardian Pharmacy has administered 1,500 doses to people in assisted living and who have come to drive-through clinics. Hopp says he\u2019ll bill Medicare and insurance companies later. \u201cWe\u2019re more focused on getting the vaccine out there and into arms,\u201d he says. Many pharmacists, especially those running mass clinics, are getting help from their communities. School districts, fire departments, landlords with empty stores have been offering the use of their space, Antypas says. Mayank Amin, who has set up mass clinics in the Philadelphia suburbs, has gotten help from doctors and other health professionals who volunteered to administer shots, sometimes as many as 1,000 over an eight-hour period. Amin, owner of Skippack Pharmacy in Skippack Township, Pennsylvania, has also fielded requests to set up more clinics. \u201cAs soon as word spread that we were doing, this, we started getting calls from different counties and mayors,\u201d Amin says. Like other pharmacists, the owners of Ochoa\u2019s Pharmacy had to give Texas health officials detailed information about the population they serve and their physical plant, including how they would store and administer the COVID-19 vaccine. The Ochoa family, which has two pharmacies in the town of Edinburg, even had to tell the state the model number of their refrigerators and how they would log the temperatures the vaccine would be stored at. \u201cWhen we received the email saying we were going to receive vaccine, we started to cry,\u201d Alessandra Ochoa says. Her family\u2019s pharmacies are located in Hidalgo County, an area hard-hit by the virus. Pharmacists have had to contend with the same uncertain pace of vaccine distribution as hospitals and other medical facilities. They fill out surveys that include estimates of the number of doses they need, but they don\u2019t know how many doses they\u2019ll get \u2014 or if they\u2019ll get any at all. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get excited and get zero,\u201d Amin says. But when the vaccine does arrive, Amin says he has to be quick on his feet, securing a location for a clinic. But despite the stress of getting a clinic together, Amin manages to bring a little levity to vaccine distribution \u2014 he\u2019ll arrive dressed in a superhero costume, complete with red cape. People who get their shots are overwhelmed with gratitude. When Guardian Pharmacy\u2019s employees arrive with the vaccine, assisted living residents greet them with applause. And Ochoa has seen many deeply emotional moments. \u201cThey\u2019re praying as they\u2019re receiving it \u2014 praying the Hail Mary, the Our Father, and there are tears streaming down their faces,\u201d she says.

Firefighter Sean Smith began running Monday morning to help his friend, who has spent the past two weeks at Good Samaritan Hospital and was intubated twice, according to a flyer for the event. \u201cOnce released, Michael will not go home but instead be transferred to a local rehabilitation center where he will learn to walk once again,\u201d the flyer states. When Smith had to pick a cause to raise money for this challenge, he chose Flannery\u2019s family. Smith was asked on his Facebook post where he planned to run. He responded it would mostly be on his treadmill, but he may use an outdoor track at one point as well. Flannery, who is still in the hospital, was overwhelmed when he heard about Sean\u2019s effort. \u201cI cried,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cStill emotional today was overwhelmed by the support from Sean and the community. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s touching. Really. He\u2019s doing that. To help my family.\u201d Flannery\u2019s battle against the COVID-19 has included two stints on a ventilator. \u201cLast couple days have been tough,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cThis is, you know, yeah, I\u2019m here. How tough can it be? No, I\u2019m not gonna sit here and whine. I\u2019ve had four different doctors, the fourth one today. Tell me that they didn\u2019t expect to see me at this point. So yeah, I\u2019m having a dang good day.\u201d Flannery hosted Club Nineteen from 1990 to 1995, which included jokes, cartoons, and letters from viewers. He was also an anchor of WCPO\u2019s \u201c9 on Your Kid\u2019s Side\u201d television show.

            "text": " LISBON (Reuters) \u2013     The COVID-19 pandemic has achieved what many mayors across Europe have tried and failed to do: wipe out tens of thousands of Airbnbs from city centres and so help lower rental costs for locals, in some places by as much as 15%.\u00a0 While Europe\u2019s cities have long welcomed tourists, critics say the surge of properties listed on short-lettings site Airbnb in recent years had priced many locals out of their own housing markets, turning historic neighbourhoods into soulless spaces.  Property management companies and landlords contacted by Reuters in cities including Lisbon, Barcelona, Prague, and Venice said the collapse of tourism in the pandemic meant some hosts had now replaced holidaymakers with mid- to long-term tenants, moved in themselves, or given up properties altogether.  Data from holiday rental analytics firm AirDNA showed the number of Airbnb listings with at least one night booked or available in the past month in Europe\u2019s 50 largest cities plunged 21.9% year-on-year in 2020. Airbnb says it has adapted to changing travel patterns, with people heading to smaller towns and cities rather than tourist hotspots. \u201cWe had more listings in France, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the Czech Republic combined at the end of 2020 than the end of 2019,\u201d spokesperson Andreu Castellano told Reuters. While some hosts in major European city destinations plan to return to Airbnb when tourists come back, others have left the holiday-let business for good.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf tourism had come back faster, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have taken this decision.\u00a0But\u00a0I can\u2019t go another year without a clear sense of when money is coming in,\u201d said Vanessa Rola, 40, who was renting four apartments in Lisbon\u2019s Gra\u00e7a district on travel platforms including Airbnb. Without tourists, she couldn\u2019t pay her own rent, and is in the process of ending her contracts. In\u00a0Venice, where AirDNA\u00a0data showed\u00a0year-on-year bookings for Airbnb and\u00a0rival Vrbo\u00a0combined were down 67% in January, residents\u2019 activists are urging the government to\u00a0seize the opportunity to help locals by, for example, capping rental days and\u00a0converting empty space into low-cost housing.\u00a0 \u201cBefore the pandemic, renting in Venice had become almost impossible for normal people,\u201d\u00a0Marco\u00a0Gasparinetti from residents\u2019 rights group Gruppo 25\u00a0Aprile told Reuters, blaming short-term lets for pushing up prices. The city of just 60,000 residents is normally visited by 20 million tourists a year.\u00a0 \u201cThere are 30,000 people who commute to Venice every day but can\u2019t afford to live here. Now that could change and help make sure Venice is not just an open-air theme park for tourists.\u201d\u00a0 \n Graphic: Sliding market \u2013 https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRBNB-EUROPE/CITIES/azgpoeoaepd/airbnb-reservations.jpg \n DISAPPEARING LISTINGS\u00a0 Last month, Airbnb reported better-than-expected bookings in its first earnings release since going public, buoyed by countryside getaways and a rebound in demand in North America. Business was weakest in Europe, the Middle East and Africa amid COVID-19 lockdowns and travel curbs.\u00a0 For years,\u00a0European mayors\u00a0have\u00a0struggled to rein in the proliferation of vacation properties\u00a0in\u00a0city centres, lacking the data to enforce\u00a0limits on rental days or the number of properties in a building\u00a0used for holiday lets.\u00a0 Airbnb, Expedia, Tripadvisor and Booking.com agreed last March to share data with the European Union\u2019s statistics agency on the number of nights and guests booked, and 2020 figures are expected in the second half of this year, Eurostat said. Last\u00a0September, 22 mayors wrote to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager\u00a0urging her to extend data-sharing to\u00a0city administrations, so they could \u201csecure the liveability of our neighbourhoods.\u201d \u201cAs tourism returns, we must make it sustainable \u2013 creating a model that isn\u2019t prohibitive to holiday lets but does have limits which ensure this is a city you can visit, but also where you can live and work,\u201d Ricardo Valente, a councillor in Porto \u2013 one of the signatory cities \u2013 told Reuters. But COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions on cross-border travel are doing the job for some city authorities \u2013 at least for now.\u00a0 \n Graphic: Airbnb available listings \u2013 https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRBNB-EUROPE/CITIES/xlbvgdkjapq/airbnb-listings.jpg \n In Lisbon, which saw huge growth in Airbnbs in the historic centre, around 5,000 of the city\u2019s roughly 25,000 listings have disappeared from the website\u00a0during the pandemic,\u00a0according to website Inside Airbnb.\u00a0\u00a0 Rental prices fell by 15% between March and December 2020, according to real estate database Confidencial Imobiliario, attributed largely to the sudden availability of thousands of former holiday lets. In Prague,\u00a0Airbnb listings\u00a0tumbled from just over 14,500 to less than 8,000, according to Inside Airbnb.\u00a0Rents have fallen by around 8%, real estate developer Trigema reported. \u201cI was losing $20,000\u00a0a month, and regulation was making things very complicated,\u201d said\u00a0Ondrej, a landlord in Prague who has sold his two Airbnb flats and given up the three he was renting to sublet.  \u201cThe Airbnb boom is over.\u201d Airbnb, however, says it has proved resilient amid shifting demand. \u201cGuests are getting out of city centres and booking whole homes,\u201d Castellano said. \u201cThe Airbnb platform inherently adapts to where demand is \u2026 we adapt to guests\u2019 needs.\u201d GONE FOR GOOD?\u00a0 Not everyone in city centres is giving up. Data from Portugal shows that while thousands of properties have fallen off Airbnb, just 114 have given up their holiday-let licence \u2013 a coveted asset in the city\u2019s historic districts, where the local council prohibited new licences from being issued in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0 Programmes attempting to lure Airbnb owners onto the social housing market through tax incentives and the promise of a five-year contract have so far seen slow uptake:\u00a0just 34 properties in Lisbon and\u00a012\u00a0in Porto, the city councils said.\u00a0 Instead, some landlords are using local letting websites\u00a0or their own direct booking channels\u00a0to find longer-term tenants.\u00a0 Airbnb released three\u00a0videos\u00a0last month entitled \u201cMade Possible By Hosts\u201d, widely seen as an attempt to woo back those who had left the platform.\u00a0 But for some, the wait is unaffordable. AirDNA\u00a0data showed forward bookings in Rome, Lisbon and Budapest were 85-90%\u00a0below\u00a0last year\u2019s levels\u00a0at the end of\u00a0March.\u00a0By contrast, bookings across U.S. holiday rental platforms were just 2% below last year, their data showed.\u00a0 Eduardo Miranda, head of Portugal\u2019s holiday let association,\u00a0expects around 15% of Airbnbs to stay off the market in Lisbon for good, even when tourism returns. \u202f\u00a0 \u201cThis is going to be another year of sacrifice,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThe\u00a0best of\u00a0this summer will be lost. And if the summer is lost, the year is lost.\u00a0Those who stay in the business will be the ones who really care.\u201d\u00a0 \n  (Reporting by Victoria Waldersee in Lisbon.

            "text": " \n\n\u00a008 Mar 2021 - 14:22  London: Millions of English children and teenagers headed back to school on Monday for the first time in two months, having endured their second extended stretch of home learning because of a strict national lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19. The reopening of English schools to all pupils is the first step in a four-stage government plan to ease the lockdown while trying to prevent a new surge in infections after a devastating winter wave that severely strained hospitals. Since the start of the pandemic, Britain has recorded 124,500 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test, the fifth highest official death toll in the world and the worst in Europe. For adults in England, the lockdown remains in force, with social contact severely restricted, people under orders to stay at home except for essential reasons, most shops closed, and cafes and restaurants able to offer only takeaway or delivery. \"Getting all schools back has been our priority and the first step of our roadmap back to normality,\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter. The reopening of schools is a huge relief to millions of parents who have spent months juggling work and full-time childcare. Primary school pupils return to their classrooms and playgrounds with some COVID rules, such as not being able to socialise with children outside a strictly defined \"bubble\", staggered arrivals and departures, and frequent hand-washing. For secondary schools and their pupils, the requirements are more onerous. Teenagers are being mass-tested for COVID -- a logistical headache for schools -- and are required to wear face coverings in class. Despite these restrictions, the near-consensus among parents, teachers, child psychologists, social workers and broader society is that getting children back into schools is urgent for their mental health, education and life chances. Most pupils had missed out on more than three months of school in the spring and early summer of 2020, when Britain was under its first strict national COVID lockdown. In that first shutdown, as in the recent one, only children considered vulnerable or those whose parents are classified as \"key workers\" by the government were allowed to go to school. However, even they were not having normal lessons, as teachers were busy organising distance learning for all the others. \u00a0 \u00a008 Mar 2021 - 13:56 In her first big civil rights case after law school, Vanita Gupta two decades ago challenged the wrongful drug convictions of dozens of Black residents of the Texas Panhandle city of Tulia, all of which hinged on faulty testimony by an undercover police officer with a checkered past. \u00a008 Mar 2021 - 12:35 Cambodian fisherman Tin Yusos tucks into a meal of the previous day's catch with his wife and granddaughter aboard a boat which doubles as their home moored by the banks of the Tonle Sap River. \u00a008 Mar 2021 - 12:21 New Zealand will buy additional COVID-19 vaccines, developed by Pfizer Inc and Germany's BioNTech, which will be enough to vaccinate the whole country, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday.

            "text": " DULUTH -- Ten years of monitoring donated venison in Minnesota have found that more than 7% of deer meat contains toxic lead fragments from bullets. The monitoring is conducted each year by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, which X-rays all of the venison donated by hunters to all Minnesota food shelves. Over the past 10 years, 94,782 pounds of venison have been donated by hunters to help feed the hungry. But of that, 6,735 pounds, 7.1%, had to be thrown out because it was contaminated with lead. The issue of lead in venison has been gaining attention for more than a decade since the first research began finding unexpectedly high lead levels in venison \u2014 not just around but sometimes scattered through the meat due to the shock and fragmentation of high-speed lead bullets. \n  The amount of donated meat that was contaminated by lead ranged annually from a low of 2.3% to a high of 15.1%. But it\u2019s not just donated deer meat that contains lead. It\u2019s likely that most of the venison hunters are eating \u2014 and feeding to their families and friends \u2014 contains similar amounts of lead with the vast majority of rifle and shotgun hunters still using lead bullets and slugs. Carrol Henderson, retired Minnesota Department of Natural Resources wildlife biologist who founded and then headed the state\u2019s Nongame Wildlife Program for decades, calculates that over the past 10 years Minnesota hunters have packaged up more than a half-million pounds of lead-contaminated venison. Henderson used DNR and Department of Agriculture data showing hunters have averaged 195,010 deer shot each year from 2011 to 2021, by all types of hunting. At an average of 37 pounds of meat per deer, that\u2019s more than 7.2 million pounds of venison. If you take the Department of Agriculture\u2019s 7.1% tainted average, that means state hunters have packaged up 512,291 pounds of lead-tainted meat. \u201cI've been following this along year by year. But when you look at that total number, holy cow, that\u2019s a half-million pounds of venison with lead in it,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI thought it was time people saw these numbers. I don\u2019t think anyone or any agency has made this available to the public before.\u201d \n  It\u2019s been known for decades that lead is a potent neurotoxin that can impact the brain, nerves and especially development in fetuses and growing children. Lead causes widespread damage to cells and organs when it is ingested, inhaled or absorbed in surprisingly small quantities. That\u2019s why lead has been removed from paint and from gasoline. Exposure to high levels of lead may cause anemia, weakness and kidney and brain damage. Very high lead exposure can cause death. Lead can cross the placental barrier, which means pregnant women who are exposed to lead also expose their unborn children, damaging developing babies' nervous systems. Henderson is concerned about the lead-bullet issue not just for human health but also for wildlife, with many eagles and other critters dying from lead poisoning each year in Minnesota after feeding on lead-tainted meat in the wild. Much like the issue of small lead fishing tackle killing loons and other water birds, Henderson said eagles and other land scavengers don\u2019t have to die from eating lead bullets because many unleaded options abound. RELATED STORY: A growing number of hunters are switching to copper and other forms of nontoxic ammunition. And more ammunition manufacturers are offering more options for all types of hunting. (Lead shotgun loads have been illegal for waterfowl hunting for more than 30 years.) \u201cBut there are still a lot of people who hunt and fish who haven\u2019t got the message about lead, or haven\u2019t listened to it yet, or maybe don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Henderson noted. \u201cAnd there are some big groups that are using scare tactics, saying that getting away from lead bullets is somehow going to end hunting or take away your guns. \u2026 That\u2019s just crazy. You can still have your traditional deer hunting experience while using nontoxic ammunition.\u201d At least three bills have been introduced in the Minnesota Legislature this year that deal with lead ammunition, although all of them stop short of requiring deer hunters to use nontoxic alternatives. RELATED STORY: HF 830 and SF19 would offer a sales tax exemption for non-toxic ammunition; HF 1645 and SF1522 would provide a voucher for free nontoxic ammunition to people, usually teenagers, who complete their firearms safety certificate; and HF 30 and SF166 allocate $133,000 from the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund for the University of Minnesota, DNR and other groups to provide outreach to hunters on the importance of making the switch to nontoxic ammunition to protect wildlife. \u201cAlthough these bills certainly help to advance public knowledge about the benefits of nontoxic ammunition, financial incentives and education are inadequate to solve the toxic lead ammunition problem,\u201d said Tom Casey, board chair of the nonprofit Friends of Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas. \u201cMinnesota must pass legislation to phase out lead ammunition. Nontoxic ammunition, and nontoxic fishing tackle. are good for human health, our natural resources, and promote the hunting and fishing communities as conservationists.\u201d"

The Portezuelo del Viento scheme is planned for Argentina\u2019s Mendoza province, which is in the west of the country abutting the Andes. If the government of Mendoza accepts the bid, the 210MW dam will be built by the China Gezhouba Group and hydropower specialist Sinohydro. Other members of the UTE Malal Hue consortium are Mendoza-based contractors Ceosa and Oasa, as well as Argentine energy contractor Impsa. Despite the fact that the UTE bid was the only one received, the authorities are still pressing ahead with the next stage of the tender, and the consortium will have to present its technical proposals by 11 August and its economic proposal by 16 November. The $1bn cost of the project will be covered by the Argentine state under a deal struck between the federal government and the province, although the Mendoza authorities have expressed some nervousness over whether it will really receive the money. Victor Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, minister for governance, said he trusted that Buenos Aires would make the promised payments. He said: \"Deposits have been made regularly, within the framework of the Nation-Province agreement, which is independent of the dam project, and comes from that old judgment that the province beats the nation \u2013 so we hope that payments continue as before.\" If UTE is chosen to build the dam, work is expected to begin in the middle of next year and take five years to build. As well as the dam, the project requires the re-routing of two roads, one of them the National Route 145, and the relocation of the small town of Las Loicas.

Prime determinants of growth Supportive government regulations for usage of photovoltaic technology drive the global solar farm market. However, high cost associated with installation hinders the market growth. Contrarily, increase in demand for renewable energy presents new opportunities in the coming years.  Download Sample PDF (284 Pages PDF with Insights): https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/10607 Covid-19 Scenario The utility-scale segment to maintain its lead position throughout the forecast period Based on type, the utility-scale segment contributed to around half of the global solar farm market in 2019, and is expected to maintain its lead position throughout the forecast period. This is due to surge in investments in grid expansion and integration technologies such as storage and UV connectivity. However, the distributed generation segment is projected to witness the highest CAGR of 20.3% from 2020 to 2027.  Get detailed COVID-19 impact analysis on the Solar Farm Market: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-for-customization/10607?reqfor=covid The commercial segment to maintain its leadership status by 2027 Based on end-use industry, the commercial segment held the highest market share in 2019, accounting for around three-fifths of the global solar power plant market in 2019, and is expected to maintain its leadership status by 2027. Moreover, this segment is projected to portray the fastest CAGR of 20.3% from 2020 to 2027. This is due to increase in economies around the world, rise in urbanization, and adoption of solar energy by commercial buildings such as offices, malls, airports, and others to decrease the carbon footprint. The research also analyzes the industrial segment.  Asia-Pacific, followed by North America, to maintain its dominant position by 2027 Based on region, Asia-Pacific, followed by North America, accounted for the largest market share in 2019, contributing to more than two-thirds of the global solar farm market, and is expected to maintain its dominant position in terms of revenue by 2027. This is due to increase in government initiatives that raise the demand for PV energy and distribution of solar lighting systems in rural areas. However, Europe is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 21.1% from 2020 to 2027, owing to rise in production of solar energy, increase in construction activities that led to installation of BIPV systems to generate electricity, and implementation of stringent environmental regulations to reduce carbon emission.

            "text": " 27 Aug, 2018 | Leigh Anderson \nSocial issues and \n                                  Nature\n  Balancing development with the environment and indigenous rights in Bolivia Proyecto Rositas, the plan for a 600 megawatt hydroelectric plant in the Bolivian jungle, is stirring up controversy among activists, conservationists, and indigenous communities in the country.\u00a0\u00a0 Set to be located in the department of Santa Cruz, near the convergence of the Grande and Rositas rivers, the project will reportedly infringe on three protected areas of the jungle, affecting nearly 2,500 species of plants and 570 species of animals, according to Bolivian newspaper P\u00e1gina Siete. It is also expected to displace hundreds of families in twelve indigenous communities due to flooding. According to a recent report by the non-profit Mongabay, these indigenous communities have filed a lawsuit against the Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE) for signing the contract for the project without consulting the locals, a right guaranteed to indigenous populations by the Bolivian constitution.    'We have not been taken into account. They have not consulted us at the beginning, before or during [the signing of the contract].\u2019 \u2014Ena Taborga, indigenous representative     'We have not been taken into account,' said indigenous representative Ena Taborga, in Mogabay\u2019s report. 'They have not consulted us at the beginning, before or during [the planning of the project].\u201d The river conservation organisation Sierra Rios has posted a petition on change.org to 'Save R\u00edo Grande and the Grand Canyon of Bolivia!' The campaign urges people to 'Say NO to the Rositas Dam project,' and argues that 'the river carries one of the highest sediment loads in the world and would fill in a reservoir with dirt within 30 years, meaning the life of the dam and project is so short as to make it a terrible investment.' The Comisi\u00f3n Mundial de Presas (World Commission on Dams) acknowledged in a study that dams have significantly contributed to human development, but that \u2018to obtain these benefits, a very high and unnecessary price has often been paid, especially in social and environmental terms, for the part of displaced people, downstream communities, taxpayers and the environment.' According to ENDE\u2019s website, the project is still in the \u2018studies\u2019 phase and is currently undergoing \u2018social management\u2019 and \u2018environmental evaluation.\u2019 The three protected areas that would be impacted are: the Parque Nacional y \u00c1rea de Manejo Integrado Serran\u00eda del I\u00f1ao, the \u00c1rea de Manejo Integrado R\u00edo Grande-Valles Cruce\u00f1os and the \u00c1rea Protegida Municipal Paraban\u00f3. Law 2727, which protects the Serran\u00eda del I\u00f1ao region in Bolivia, states that its objectives include: \u2018to conserve the biological diversity of the ecosystems\u2019 of the region, to \u2018conserve outstanding values and richness of fauna, flora, genetic resources and wild species in danger of extinction\u2019 and to \u2018preserve the natural areas for the development of studies and scientific research and environmental education.\u2019 P\u00e1gina Siete reports that the contract for the construction of the plant violates legal stipulations at national, departmental and municipal levels. The paper also states that the project\u2019s flood area, which comprises 45,000 hectares, will adversely affect the habitats of thousands of species, some of which are endangered. Reuters reports that the goal of the Rositas Project is for Bolivia to \u2018become South America\u2019s leading energy powerhouse\u2019 and to \u2018export more than 8,000 megawatts beginning in 2025.\u2019 The $1 billion plan is being financed by Chinese firms. \u2018What will happen to our country?\u2019 asked Ely Zarate, leader of the one of the 12 affected communities, in Mongabay\u2019s publication. 'We only think about money, but we do not think about the future of our children and grandchildren that will come later.' While the government has promised to help relocate the indigenous communities affected by the project, constitutional lawyer and indigenous rights expert Nelson Lamadrid was indignant about the issue.   Dams have significantly contributed to human development, butto obtain these benefits, a very high and unnecessary price has often been paid.  \u2014World Commission on Dams    \u2018What we do not want is to lose the culture and the indigenous peoples that we have in Bolivia, and we don\u2019t want them to be treated as objects,\u2019 he told Mongabay. \u2019They cannot just be moved from here to there.\u2019 Both the Department of Energy and the Ministry of Environment and Water in La Paz declined to comment for this article because they were not authorised to speak about a project in progress."

            "text": " Today, 8 March, is International Women\u2019s Day, which celebrates the achievements of women and calls for action to accelerate gender parity. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cWomen\u00a0in leadership: achieving an equal future in a Covid-19 world.\u201d UN Women, which coordinates the campaign, is encouraging the use of the hashtag #ChooseToChallenge, declaring that a challenged world is an alert world; and from challenge, comes change. Gender inequalities are especially present in mountain and guiding communities. Perhaps the most remarkable example of this is on the summit of the world\u2019s highest mountain. In 1953, two men, Edmund Hillary\u00a0and\u00a0Sherpa Tenzing, were the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest. It wasn\u2019t until 22 years later that the first female stood on the summit: Japanese woman Junko Tabei. Even today, membership of the British Mountain Guides (BMG), the national association that trains and assesses UK mountain guides, is 70 per cent male.  Despite these gender imbalanced statistics, women are challenging male dominance and taking their place in the mountains. Many are among the first female mountain leaders and tour guides in their countries, challenging deeply ingrained cultural and professional norms that these are not jobs nor environments for women.  Last year, Afghanistan was again declared the worst place in the world for a woman to live by the UN due to the lack of women\u2019s rights, poor access to education and the high maternal mortality rate. But these realities haven\u2019t held back Fatima, Afghanistan\u2019s first female guide. She was born in one of the most deprived and outlying areas of Afghanistan called Lal wa Sarjangal in Ghor province. Not atypically, aged eight she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to school and was instead shepherding her family\u2019s cattle and sheep. She says: \u201cIt was tough, but running on those high hills after the animals was where I was first introduced to leading a group.\u201d  She only started her education when her family moved due to Taliban fighting and she was offered free lessons, provided by an NGO for refugees, which taught her English and later employed her as a teaching assistant. Proud of her country\u2019s historical architecture and beautiful nature, she began blogging about her trekking and trips to national landmarks. This soon attracted attention, and she began taking tourists along for the ride. When asked which is her favourite place, she says: \u201cI love to guide tourists in Bamiyan because it\u2019s historically and culturally rich and offers beautiful views for trekking.\u201d  Fatima\u2019s decision to become a guide was not supported by her family, as in Afghanistan, women are discouraged from travelling without a man. \u201cWhen I first decided to be a tour guide, my parents told me, \u2018you will go to hell\u2019.\u201d But even their censure didn\u2019t stop her: \u201cWhen I guide female tourists it gives me hope; I feel like a brave girl and my self-confidence to chase my dreams increases.\u201d  A true trailblazer, Fatima recognises the positive influence her actions have had on promoting gender equality in Afghanistan and wants to set up a guiding agency of women. \u201cI think I am the one to make Afghanistan safe for women,\u201d she says.  There is nothing more inspiring than a group of women together in the mountains  Mountain guide Jangu Lepcha from West Bengal, India, also got her first experience of trekking due to her family\u2019s circumstances: \u201cWithout transport, we had to hike for four hours every day during my childhood,\u201d she says. Jangu is the only female mountain guide in northern India, a status that comes with its own set of challenges: \u201cSometimes I face difficulties due to the lack of professionalism among officials. As a woman, it is always harder to get permits.\u201d In Tajikistan, Safina Shohaydarova became a mountain guide after trekking with a French friend, with whom she set up the NGO Women Rock in Pamirs several years later. The NGO trains Pamiri girls to become mountain guides and organises trips that enable women and girls to enjoy the mountains. Although proud of her work in supporting other women to enjoy the mountains, Safina says her greatest accomplishment is managing to balance family life with a rewarding career. \u201cMy greatest achievement is being married and having two little children, but still being able to go out to the mountains and guide, which is very unusual for our community,\u201d she says. All three women are employed by Untamed\u00a0Borders, a tourism agency that supports adventurous travellers to experience largely unvisited areas of the world. Often the only travel company working in a country, Untamed Borders recognises the responsibility of employing staff from all major ethnic groups, as well as men and women. This gives guests a wider insight into the lives of the people and culture of the country they visit, providing a richer and fuller experience, while also practising and promoting equality.  These women, living in societies in which working as guides is barely acceptable, are also guiding the way for wider society to allow women greater freedoms. As Jangu says: \u201cThere is nothing more inspiring than a group of women together in the mountains.\u201d Safina\u2019s services can be booked here.  Fatima\u2019s guiding services can be booked through Untamed Borders. Jangu\u2019s services can be booked through her Instagram or by emailing:\u00a0janguadventures13@gmail.com.

Entitled \"Mu'anath\" (Feminine), the exhibition held ahead of International Women's Day (IWD) is organized by Art D'Egypte, a renowned Egyptian platform of art and heritage, and features the unique works of 20 talented painters, photographers and sculptors. (Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa) by Mahmoud Fouly CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- \"My paintings here express nature. For me, feminine means nature, because Mother Earth combines strength, tenderness, movement, change and patience,\" said Reham el-Adl, an abstract painter, on Saturday during the opening ceremony of an exhibition held in downtown Cairo to mark International Women's Day (IWD). Entitled \"Mu'anath\" (Feminine), the exhibition held ahead of IWD is organized by Art D'Egypte, a renowned Egyptian platform of art and heritage, and features the unique works of 20 talented painters, photographers and sculptors. The event will last until the beginning of April, according to Nadine Abdel-Ghaffar, founder of Art D'Egypte. \"As the Egyptian government supports the empowerment of women, we try to support the empowerment of women through art, for art is a soft power, just like women,\" the lady said. Displayed in several rooms, the art works of the participating 13 female and seven male artists include oil and acrylic paintings, photographic prints and copper, iron and stainless steel sculptures. On one of the walls, Alia el-Goan, a 25-year-old photographer who was born in California and raised in Cairo, displayed six photos of a tree, which she said symbolizes the freedom, fruitfulness, care and shelter of women. \"On the IWD, I encourage all women to express themselves, talk about their social problems and never be silenced, for women have the right to have their voice heard,\" the photographer told Xinhua. Dozens of distinguished guests attended the exhibition's opening reception, including Egyptian business tycoon Naguib Sawiris, former Egyptian Investment Minister Sahar Nasr and the ambassadors of the United States, France, Ireland and Colombia. \"As Chairman Mao said, women hold up half the sky,\" said Ireland's Ambassador to Egypt Sean O'Regan, referring to late Chinese leader Mao Zedong, while expressing his support for the political, economic and social empowerment of women. \"It is a fact that when women are involved in decision-making, you get better decisions, and when women are involved in peacemaking, you get better peace processes and agreements,\" the Irish ambassador said. Colombia's Ambassador to Egypt Ana Milena Munoz de Gaviria noted that the vice president of Colombia is a woman and in line with Colombian law requiring that 50 percent of the cabinet to be women, \"yet we need to work more on the empowerment of women at the low-income level.\" UN Women, a United Nations body dedicated to gender equality and women's empowerment, said that the theme of this year's IWD is \"Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.\" \"International Women's Day this year comes at a difficult time for the world and for gender equality, but at a perfect moment to fight for transformative action and to salute women and young people for their relentless drive for gender equality and human rights,\" Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of UN Women, said in a statement on Monday. In an interview with Xinhua on the eve of the IWD, Nehad Abol El-Komsan, chairwoman of the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights, said Egypt has made plenty of progress regarding the political and economic empowerment of women, adding that women constitute 25 percent of the government and parliament, with \"women holding key posts in the state and in the private sector too.\" However, \"the social empowerment of women is still lacking and needs more efforts to be achieved,\" she said. She noted that Egyptian women have become braver in reporting violence and harassment. \"I tell women on their international day to speak up, express themselves freely and let no one oppress or blackmail them under any justification.\" Enditem \n "

            "text": " Oct 15, 2021 Design of the new national hospital (Photo credit: Office of the Prime Minister) Dominica will have a new national hospital within two and a half years, thanks to the generosity of the People\u2019s Republic of China. That new hospital, worth forty million US dollars, will be constructed on the same site at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Goodwill. A ground breaking ceremony to mark the official construction process took place at the Lindo Park in Goodwill on Monday 8 August 2016. Among the guests of honor at the ceremony were President Charles Savarin and First Lady Clara Savarin, former president Eluid Williams and Mrs Williams, wife of former president Dr Nicholas Liverpool, Verna Liverpool, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, Chinese Ambassador Li Jiangning, Government ministers and members of the diplomatic corps. In June of 2007, the Ministry of Health and Social Security as it was named then, established the hospital building committee to provide certified plans for a new modern medical facility.  In June 2012 a technical team from China, organized by the Beijing Institute of Architectural Designs, was dispatched to undertake a feasibility study of the site of the project.  In October 2012, the team arrived to conduct their research from the 8th to the 19th of and met with the utility companies and other relative authorities to gather appropriate data for development of the project. The agreement for the basic design scheme was signed on the 19 October 2012 at the end of feasibility study.  Following the approval of the basic design scheme, the contract for the complete design was signed in October 2013 between China IPPR, International Engineering Corporation Company Limited and the Dominica government. This was followed by the signing of a supplementary design concept in November 2015 and then the contract signing between government and the Hunan Construction Engineering Group Cooperation in December 2015. As per projects officer in the Ministry of Health and the Environment, Sylvester Henderson, the new construction involves renewal of major aspects of the hospital infrastructure including construction of two (2) four-floor ward buildings that will provide accommodation for male and female medical and surgical patients, pediatrics, gynecology; two (2) new medical technology buildings for clinical laboratory and blood bank services, Dialysis services, radiology department (including CT scan, MRI, mammography, HIFU \u2013 High Frequency Focused Ultrasound), and the other with a new Intensive Care Unit, pathology department, operating theater department with four (4)operating rooms. An outpatient department; a two-floor building with information desk, payment desk, registration desk, dispensary, gynecology and pediatric outpatient services on the ground floor and on the first floor \u2013 internal medicine will also form part of the project. The project will also include new and modern Accident and Emergency Department (two-floor building) with emergency rooms, an emergency operating room, observation rooms, asthma rooms, doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 rooms, etc. New accommodation will also be provided for the administration department on the first floor of the Accident and Emergency Unit Building. In addition, accommodation for teaching department with classrooms, single and double room hostels for consultants and students and a theater style lecture hall, as well as new accommodation for the Ophthalmology Unit will form part of the project. Moreover, the medical main street which runs from east to west will be reconstructed with four (4) floors to serve the wards at the fourth floor connecting all buildings, including the retained gynecology and pediatrics ward. All floors of the main street will be accessed by stairs, ramps and elevators. Henderson indicated that the introduction of completely new services including MRI and high intensity focus ultrasound for the treatment of tumors and other illnesses will be available upon completion. These two pieces of equipment will be provided by the Chinese Government. The project will be done in seven phases and is expected to take two and a half years or thirty months to complete.  Turning of the soil at the Lindo Park by Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit; Minister for Health and the Environment, Dr Kenneth Darroux; Chinese Ambassador, Li Jiangning, and Manager of Hunan Construction Engineering Group Corporation\u2019s Overseas Department, Xie Gaohong was the highlight of the ceremony. Photos of the designs of the New National Hospital compliments of the Office of the Prime Minister   Mr Skerritt told us that he had signed a loan agreement in China for $300million dollars to build a new hospital and an international airport.To now report that the Chinese a giving Dominica a $40million dollar gift leaves the question, what has happened or will happen with the loan portion which was to go to the hospital.Maybe we were told a lie from the start,however clarification on that matter is urgently needed now Mr Skerritt Mr Skerritt told us that he had signed a loan agreement in China for $300million dollars to build a new hospital and an international airport.To now report that the Chinese a giving Dominica a $40million dollar gift leaves the question, what has happened or will happen with the loan portion which was to go to the hospital.Maybe we were told a lie from the start,however clarification on that matter is urgent needed now Mr Skerritt The blue nay sayers, those absolutely hurt by the project now entering into the CONSTRUCTION PHASE  are now advancing the view that the facility is not a new facility but a refurbishment, a fixing up, a repair of what presently exists. They say that as long as the facility is developed on the site of the present Priness Maragret Hospital it cannot and ought not to be considered as a new facility. In another argument, they are arguing that $40 million dollars is insufficient for the project. They site 18 million dollars for a bridge and 27 million dollars for a State House as fair examples of the point they are trying to advance. What they are not saying is that the 40 million dollars is in US dollars which is equivalent to EC 109 million dollars. When I confronted them with the truth, the facts, like in true reflection of their leader when faced with the facts or asked to provide the facts, they attempted to chide me for irresponsibly inflating the estimated cost from 40 million to 109 million. The point is what is in it for them? Of what benefit is there for them to see only negativity in a truly national development project? What about the project that is really troubling to them. Thank you for your most generous gift, Peoples Republic of China Renovated but not new Thomian (or Doubting Thomas), exactly what is your point? I guess you cannot resist trying to find something negative to say about that transformative $109+million dollar project ! Make sure all you include wards for Teenage Girls and Teenage Boys, and not have them among grown ups. A few years ago my teenage daughter was admitted on Glover Ward and I was so upset, because a lady next to her was coughing a lot and not really putting her hands to her mouth, then they moved her from where she was, put her in the passage and then the nurses etc. passing with the patients poo poo and pee pee over my child. That\u2019s not nice at all. The government have to look into that, and give the teenagers separate wards. Just a thought \u2013 While it is understood that everything cannot be done at once, but between now and the next 30 months of construction, serious consideration ought to be given to road safety along Charles Avenue and through-flow traffic and access to the Accident and Emergency Department. If it is already being considered then great. If not it should be. I pray success for the project that will be of immense benefit to the country. Congrats. Mr. Cadette, good observation. You will no doubt be happy to know that The PM in the 2016-2017 Budget Address stated that funds raised from the Highway Levy (some $900,000+) have been allocated for the improvement of Charles Avenue. I am very encouraged by this phase. A great boost for the health Services Sector. Your email address will not be published.

This oil-backed loan carried the following terms: a variable interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + a 3.50% margin, a 4 year grace period, a 14 year year maturity, a 0.75% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee (See: \u201cFacility Agreement\u201d). The purpose of the Ca\u00f1ar and Naranjal Flood Control Project was to set fluvial defenses along the Ca\u00f1ar river, and thereby protect some 37,000 hectares and 176 km along the river and its effluents, as well as Patul, Piedras, Norcay rivers and the Trobador streams. With a total of 10 gates, the project sought to regulate up to 1,500 m3/s of water coming from the overflows of the river, to a 23 km long bypass which will have a deposit in La Lagartera lakes, which was designed to store 14 million cubic meters of water for irrigation. The project was carried out by China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE). It was originally scheduled for completion in August 2015. However, the $393.8 million contract with CWE did not become effective until 2015. Construction began on 21 April 2015. Project activities included the construction of a diversion dam; the construction of a 23 km long canal; the construction of 2 bridges; and the rehabilitation of 4 bridges. The project fed river water to eight giant Chinese turbines designed to produce enough electricity to power more than a third of Ecuador. The project was completed and handed over to the authorities on 12 January 2016.

The Spanish project title is Construcci\u00f3n del Sistema de Control de Inundaciones Naranjal and Construcci\u00f3n del Sistema de Control de Inundaciones Ca\u00f1ar. We identify the interest rate based on the 6 month LIBOR rate at the time of the signing of the loan agreement: 0.409% in July 2013. The total interest rate is therefore identified as 0.409% + 3.50% = 3.909%.

            "text": " Accessibility Tools Elon Musk\u2019s net worth plunged last week as tech stocks got hammered and Tesla shares\u2019 stunning rise quickly unraveled. Wall Street is growing increasingly nervous about rising bond yields, which could make borrowing more expensive. That could eat into corporate profits, which is why investors have begun to reverse some of the positions they took over the past year in high-growth but risky tech stocks like Tesla. Tesla\u2019s stock fell 11.5% last week. Musk, who owns nearly 18% of Tesla\u2019s shares, bore most of the brunt of that massive sell-off. Musk\u2019s wealth fell by $27 billion last week, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index. The decline in his net value is roughly equal to the entire fortune held by Dyson founder James Dyson \u2014 the 52nd richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg. Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos have been swapping places atop Bloomberg\u2019s list of richest people in the world since January. But Musk now sits in a distant second place: $157 billion, compared to Bezos\u2019 net worth of $177 billion. Musk remains $21 billion ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who remains the third-richest person on the planet. Tesla\u2019s stock gained 743% in 2020, propelling it to No. 5 on the list of most valuable companies on the stock market. And the stock continued to climb in the early weeks of of 2021, gaining another 25% to a record high close of $883.90 on January 26. But shares have lost nearly a third of their value since then, placing them firmly into bear market territory. The decline sent Tesla\u2019s market value to No. 7, behind Facebook and Berkshire Hathaway but ahead of JPMorgan Chase. Friday it closed below $600 a share for the first time since early December. Shares were down an additional 3% in premarket trading Monday. Even if Tesla\u2019s stock continues to sink, Musk still stands to become much richer in 2021 and beyond. He received four grants to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares each in 2020. Each of those was worth $4.5 billion at Friday\u2019s closing price, after taking into account the $70 per share excerise price Musk will have to pay. Musk will probably receive three additional options grants this year, each as large and as lucrative as those he received in 2020. Musk has not exercised any of his options. Executives typically exercise them when they are due to expire, or to free up cash. Musk has never sold Tesla shares. Musk also is the largest shareholder at privately-held SpaceX. The company completed a new funding round in February. While it has not disclosed the details, numerous published reports say the $850 million that it raised increased the valuation of that company 60% to $74 billion. Life should be spent well. But sometimes we feel like we\u2019re working only to pay our bills. And this is not how we should be spending our lives. You must be logged in to post a comment.

            "text": " Ohio college student dies after alleged hazing incident Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  An Ohio college student who was in critical condition after an alleged fraternity hazing incident has died, his family's attorney said Sunday. \"The death of Stone Foltz is a tragedy. He was a beloved son, brother, and grandson,\" Sean Alto, the family\u2019s attorney, said in a statement. In a later statement, Alto said the firm was investigating \"exactly what happened on March 4.\" \"Investigations involving hazing are complex and take time, but the Foltz family will eventually know the truth,\" Alto said. \"No family is ever prepared to say goodbye, especially under these circumstances.\" Foltz had been kept alive for a time so his organs could be donated, which the family had agreed to \"so that others may have a second chance at life,\" Alto's statement said. Foltz, 20, a sophomore at Bowling Green State University and a new member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, was allegedly hazed Thursday during an initiation event when he was made to drink alcohol, school officials said. Bowling Green State University placed the fraternity on interim suspension Friday as it investigates. On Saturday, the school said it was temporarily \"suspending all new member intake processes and on- and off-campus social events\u201d for Greek fraternity and sorority organizations. A statement from Pi Kappa Alpha\u2019s Memphis-based office said it placed the Bowling Green chapter on administrative suspension and would consider permanent suspension as well as expulsion of the chapter's members. Pi Kappa Alpha said it advised the Bowling Green frat's leaders to cooperate with law enforcement, and would itself cooperate with authorities during the investigation. \"The International Fraternity is heartbroken about the death of Stone Foltz,\" the statement said. \"No family should have to endure such a devastating loss.\" \"The Fraternity has a zero-tolerance policy toward illegal activity, substance abuse, bullying, and hazing of any kind,\" the fraternity's statement said, reminding members to \"immediately and confidentially report any hazing or potential hazing or other harmful activity.\" Foltz graduated from Buckeye Valley High School in Delaware, Ohio, north of Columbus, in 2019. Andrew Miller, the superintendent of the Buckeye Valley Local School District, said in a statement Sunday that \"Stone was a friend to everyone who was blessed to know him.\" \"The Buckeye Valley community mourns the loss of this amazing young person,\" the statement said. The news comes after a 19-year-old college student, Adam Oakes, was found dead on the morning of Feb. 27 after a fraternity hazing incident at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.

Zhao Dianlong, president of the China Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), pledged his company\u2019s commitment to the project which will ensure an on-time completion of work.\n\u201cWith proper management and workmanship, the project will be completed in the time envisaged. I firmly believe that the St. John\u2019s Deepwater-Harbour project will be successfully achieved under strong support and timely coordination.\u201d Dianlong voiced the commitment during the ground-breaking ceremony to launch the project on Monday night. According to government officials, the multi-million-dollar project will be among one of the largest facilities in the region.\nDescribed as the single largest infrastructural project ever in the country, the expansion and modernisation of the port is expected to boost the country\u2019s economy in a major way, due in part to the longstanding relations that exist between Antigua and Barbuda and China. Senator Mary-Clair Hurst, the chairperson of the Antigua Port Authority, said the new facility will bring opportunities to Antigua and Barbuda and despite the difficulties in the past the economic fortunes at the port are turning around.\n\u201cFrom 2014 to present, have shown great improvements and we continue to demand more from the individual staff with management on managing the daily affairs of this most relevant national asset. The necessity to ensure that the port continues to improve is a national priority,\u201d Hurst said.\n(More in today\u2019s Daily Observer) \n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n Please enter an answer in digits:   \n\n Newsco Observer is your local, regional and international news website.

Suscribe x MercoPress, en Espa\u00f1ol Montevideo, October 15th 2021  - 18:35 UTC \u00a0 \u00a0 The construction of the Nestor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic dams in Santa Cruz, Patagonia is finally set to begin now that China has deposited the first 287.7 million dollars tranche of funding for the massive 4.71 billion project, Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez announced before leaving for a state visit to China. \u00a0Receipt of the money means companies can \u201cstart building what will be the most important hydroelectric project in the history of Argentina,\u201d Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez said who is expected to begin activities in Beijing on Tuesday. She leads a trade delegation of more than 100 Argentine businesspeople. The dams will be located on the Santa Cruz river, which currently does not have a hydroelectric plant, and will be built by a a joint venture made up of local firms Electroingenieria and Hidrocuyo and China\u2019s Gezhouba Group. The firms won the bidding process, which was questioned by opposition lawmakers. The funding for the project was agreed to last year when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Argentina and signed a battery of agreements, including a 2.09bn dollars agreement to renovate the Belgrano Cargas freight rail system and a 11bn dollars currency swap which has helped to bolster the Argentine Central Bank reserves. The Jorge Ceprnic and N\u00e9stor Kirchner dams would be one of the most important energy projects in Argentina\u2019s recent history and will provide a massive increase to the power grid in the country\u2019s south. It will also help the country reduce its overdependence on thermal power, which requires ever-increasing quantities of LNG to operate, particularly during the winter months when natural gas is reserved for home heating. President N\u00e9stor Kirchner dam will be 75.5 meters high, include six Francis turbines and have an installed capacity of 1,140 megawatts while the Governor Jorge Cepernic dam will be 43.5 meters high, include five Kaplan turbines and have an installed capacity of 600 megawatts. The project was approved in 2007 with the names Condor Cliff (now Kirchner) and La Barrancosa (now Cepernic) at a cost of 16 billion pesos, which was 35% lower than the current price tag. The tender was awarded to the joint venture of IMPSA, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica and Camargo Correa but later the project was cancelled due to a lack of funds. The Argentine leader will spend almost the entire week in China and is expected to attend a banquet with several Chinese government officials and to open a business forum on Wednesday. Besides foreign minister Hector Timerman who is travelling with the president, Planning Minister Julio De Vido; Economy minister Axel Kicilloff and YPF CEO Miguel Galuccio are already in China. China together with Brazil have become Argentina's main trade partners, but Beijing is also crucial with investments and the financial support, a currency swap that helped increase international reserves when Argentina is locked out of international money markets. Besides, according to sources close to Cristina Fernandez, she is convinced that the epicenter of world power is rapidly moving to Asia and the Pacific, led by China and thus the significance of all the accords signed and further cooperation which is expected to be signed this coming week in Beijing.  Not bad for a country in free fall! Not bad for a country in \u201ctechnical\u201d default for which domestic and international opposition were rejoicing less than a year ago!\nI guess the multipolar world of today allows this to countries that in past times would have become international pariahs. Welcome to a new reality. Reason why they call it Nestor Kirchner dam??  That's who they bought a lot of the land of for the dam.   Amazing how he snapped up that barren land for a few pesos and then the govt had to buy it off him for the project.\n\nThe Chinese can have that murdering old hag. Later CFK announced that it will be a great place to hide all those that have been \u201csuicided\u201d under her regime.

Ludlow 12\u00b0c Children arrive at Outwood Academy in Woodlands, Doncaster Millions of children are returning to the classroom for the first time since December as coronavirus restrictions in England begin to ease. Under the first phase of the Government\u2019s road map out of lockdown, visits to care homes are also resuming from Monday \u2013 under strictly controlled conditions. And the rules around meeting another household have been loosened to allow people to leave home to meet one other person outdoors for a coffee or picnic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that although it is \u201conly a small relaxation of the rules\u201d, the changes will bring \u201cjoy and relief\u201d to families after months of \u201ctough restrictions\u201d. One scientist advising the Government acknowledged it is \u201cinevitable\u201d there will be an increase in the numbers of cases as schools go back. Professor Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said a small rise in the R number \u2013 representing the reproduction rate of the virus \u2013 is less important than the absolute numbers being admitted to hospital and intensive care. Ministers believe the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccinations should break the link between case numbers and hospital admissions and deaths as more and more people are protected from the disease. Prof Semple said schools are \u201cabsolutely\u201d safe for children to return to as surveys showed that even secondary school pupils are far less likely to contract the disease or transmit it than adults. He said the main risks come from the increased contacts among adults which will inevitably follow. \u201cThe main driver is not the pupil-teacher relationship,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. \u201cWhen we talk about schools, it is the fact that the school brings adults together, whether that\u2019s teaching staff, the domestic staff, the catering staff, and it\u2019s an opportunity for mixing.\u201d He said the advice for teachers is to wear face masks, while being \u201creally careful\u201d in the common room. \u201cTheir colleagues are more of a risk to them than the children,\u201d he said. Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it it important that other lockdown restrictions remain in place for at least three weeks as schools return. \u201cWe know that reopening schools will increase transmission, but we should be able to keep the R below one \u2013 that\u2019s the key thing to stop the runaway increase of infections,\u201d he told Times Radio. \u201cThe key thing is that children themselves, and parents, don\u2019t think \u2018The schools are open, we can relax, we can mix outside of school\u2019 \u2013 in a sense, come out of lockdown around the school opening.\u201d The reopening of schools comes amid warnings by education experts that more damage was being done to pupils by keeping them at home than having them return to the classroom. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said he is looking at proposals, including a five-term academic year, a shorter summer holiday and longer school days to help pupils catch up on learning lost during the pandemic. Labour is calling for catch-up breakfast clubs before the school day starts, saying that an analysis of official data suggests children have each lost an average of 109 face-to-face school days since the first lockdown in March last year. Most secondary school age pupils should wear face coverings in class and inside school buildings, but primary age pupils should not. #BackToSchoolhttps://t.co/VU0rRyhkc8 \u2014 Department for Education (@educationgovuk) March 8, 2021 Secondary school pupils, who are likely to have their return staggered over the week to allow for mass testing, are being asked to take three voluntary Covid-19 tests on site and one at home over the first fortnight. They will then be sent home-testing kits to use twice weekly. The Department for Education (DfE) is also advising secondary school students to wear face coverings wherever social distancing cannot be maintained, including in the classroom. But primary school children are not being asked to carry out Covid-19 tests or wear face masks on their return. Some children will also return to classrooms in Northern Ireland for the first time since December. P1 to P3 pupils will return to class but are set to go back to remote learning after two weeks. First Minister Arlene Foster has expressed hope that those primary pupils will ultimately be able to remain in school. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of care home residents in England will be able to receive indoor visits from a nominated friend or relative as of this week. Visitors will be tested prior to visits, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and be asked to keep physical contact to a minimum.

The Cass County Sheriff\u2019s office says they responded to Saddlebag Lake in Marcellus Township at around 2:45 p.m.. When deputies arrived, the man was in the water hanging on to some ice, but unable to pull himself out. Assisting fire officials in rescue gear were able to reach the spot on the lake and pull the man out and bring him to shore. He was identified as 58-year-old Ronald First of Cassopolis, and after a medical evaluation at the scene, he was determined to be ok. The caller who reported the incident was a relative, Thomas First of Dowagiac, who had been out on the ice as well and also fell through. He was able to pull himself out of the water and back onto the ice before calling 911 for the rescue of Ronald. Assisting agencies were Marcellus Fire/Ambulance, Michigan State Police, and Tribal Police."

The deceased, believed to be in her thirties and yet to be identified, was found dead with wounds on her body in the hotel room. The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Regional Command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Effia Tenge, confirmed the story to the Ghanaian Times, in Accra, yesterday. She said on Wednesday at about 3:30pm, a worker of the hotel (name withheld) reported to the police that a man who rented a room at the hotel on March 1, this year, received a female visitor. DSP Tenge said the complainant told the police that the client (man) left the hotel on March 2 and did not return. She stated that on March 3, when workers of the hotel opened the room to rent it to a new client, they saw the female visitor motionless on the bed. DSP Tenge said when the police proceeded to the scene, they saw the woman motionless with her clothes on. She said the woman's body was with wounds, suspected to have been inflicted with a sharp implement. DSP Tenge said when the police carried out a search in the hotel room, they did not find any sharp object, and there was no form of identification of the deceased. She said police investigation revealed the management of the hotel had poor record keeping, and failed to record details of clients in a book even though there was one available. DSP Tenge stated that the hotel did not also have a Close Circuit Television (CCTV) camera to boost security or investigations. She said the body has been taken to the Police Hospital mortuary while efforts were underway to identify the deceased and to apprehend the suspect. DSP Tenge appealed to the public to provide reliable information to the police to help apprehend the suspect. Read the original article on Ghanaian Times.

            "text": "  Print Above: Grenada (CJ Photo) By the Caribbean Journal staff China\u2019s government has agreed to provide $1.33 million in funding to complete the final phase of work on 351 housing units in Grenada\u2019s Mt Gay, Frequente and Soubise. The agreement was reached last week between Housing Minister Delma Thomas and China\u2019s Charge d\u2019Affaires to Grenada, Chen Robio. \u201cImmediately upon taking office in February as the Minister of Housing, one of my main and urgent goals was to ensure that scores of Grenadians \u2014 the many who so badly need better housing \u2014 get into those houses in the shortest possible time,\u201d Thomas said at the signing ceremony. \u201cI immediately contacted the Chinese embassy here on the issue of the assistance of the People\u2019s Republic of China to help complete the project\u201d. The houses were among a group of  2,000 promised by China to Grenada following the devastation of Hurricane Ivan in 2004, destroying 90 percent of the island\u2019s housing stock. That number was around 29,000 homes, according to government data. Grenada\u2019s government had initially been slated to provide counterpart financing for the last phase of the project, which included the costs of sewerage, water and electrical installations. We were fully aware that the Chinese government had up to that point done their part of the bargain,\u201d the Housing minister said. \u201cThey had done everything we had asked of them,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBy coming forward, the assistance of the People\u2019s Republic of China, have \u2014 in a way \u2013taken our feet from the fire.\u201d Grenada\u2019s government said that a technical team would be arriving from China to begin the final phase of work.

            "text": " Sections Emilio Sanchez and the British government fought the lucrative business as American authorities looked the other way \n        \n        \n          John Harris\n        \n         The men of the \u201cPortuguese Company,\u201d about a dozen in total, arrived in 1850s Manhattan ready to bring the illegal slave trade to America\u2019s mega-metropolis. Hailing from Brazil, Portugal and Angola, the group earned their moniker from their common tongue. They were attracted by New York\u2019s large port, with ample ships and sailors, as well as the city\u2019s vast financial services and lax law enforcement. Posing as merchants in legal business, the Company snapped up hundreds of ships to send to Africa for captives and then to the sugar estates of Cuba. The Company would traffic thousands of Africans for their own enrichment, but they also crossed Cuban immigrant Emilio Sanchez, whose spycraft for the British government would prevent thousands more from enduring the Middle Passage aboard American slave ships. Sanchez\u2019s turn to informant is just one example of how fighting slavery was a collective effort. A wide cast of characters, from the great orators of the abolitionist movement to the conductors of the Underground Railroad to men like Sanchez fought against the institution of slavery and all its components, including the illegal international slave trade. Their work was dangerous, their foes were powerful \u2013 even in the \u201cfree\u201d North \u2013 and the U.S. government was rarely on their side. Americans had a long history of ignoring slave trade laws. Despite a federal act in 1807, which banned U.S. participation in the Atlantic slave trade, and another law in 1820, which carried the death penalty, American seamen and vessels remained deeply involved in the traffic to Cuba and Brazil, where the trade was also banned. In New York, key officials like U.S. Marshal Isaiah Rynders were notoriously sympathetic to slave interests and several took bribes from traffickers to let ships sail out to sea. When slave traders did end up in court, juries rarely convicted. At the federal level, successive Democratic administrations were more interested in preventing the abolitionist British from searching American ships at sea than halting the slave trade. A stunning behind the curtain look into the last years of the illegal transatlantic slave trade in the United States\n As American law enforcement remained lax, the Portuguese Company became prolific. One observer with knowledge of the trade wrote in 1856 that \u201cthe business is active and pretty steady, not less than two, or three or four vessels getting off every month from New York alone.\u201d There was no shortage in help getting out to sea, he explained, since \u201cgold is generally paid down on the spot for all supplies and services [and] bribery is largely employed, and is relied upon as a sure and successful mode of getting the vessels off.\u201d Meanwhile, the Portuguese Company thrived. By the late 1850s, they even branched out to other cities like Boston, Baltimore and New Orleans. In all, over 400 slave ships sailed out of U.S. ports bound for the African coast and brought close to 200,000 captives back across the Atlantic Ocean, mainly to Cuba, although some like the Clotilda ended up in the American South. A host of accomplices in American ports\u2014captains, seamen, corrupt officials, ship dealers and merchants supplying provisions for their vessels\u2014also feasted on their ill-gotten gains. The British government looked on in horror. Previously one of the biggest slave trading nations, by the mid-1800s Britain viewed itself as the world\u2019s beacon of liberty and sent an antislavery fleet to African waters to patrol for illegal slave ships. With strong American opposition to naval interference and lacking solid information on which to base captures, there was little they could do. Meanwhile, the British consul in New York, Edward Archibald, was also stumped. Even when he could learn snippets about the trade, he told his bosses in London that it was \u201cworse than useless\u201d to share them with local authorities. The British had experience, however, with stubborn slave trading nations. For many years they had channeled money to Brazil and Cuba to pay spies\u2014usually slave traders who had turned their back on the trade, or at least claimed they had. Now it was time to try that tactic in New York. Emilio Sanchez, who had come to the U.S. in his youth, was an ideal informant. A sugar importer and ship dealer who worked in New York, he operated cheek by jowl with the slave traders and their accomplices in the merchant district of Lower Manhattan. He also had an axe to grind; he had been caught up in one of their failed voyages\u2014unwittingly, he claimed\u2014and had ended up with a bruised reputation and depleted finances. Archibald grilled him on his past dealings and came away convinced that Sanchez had indeed been duped. Sanchez wanted to be a spy to wreak revenge on the slave traders who had drawn him into their dealings\u2014and he wanted to make money doing it. But although he was never explicit about it, he seems to have had a broader ideological motive. A few years later, he wrote anonymously in the New York press, attacking slave traders and corrupt officials, and making clear his intention to \u201cdestroy the slave trade\u201d as a whole. Archibald was certainly impressed by Sanchez when he met him, and sensing the Cuban immigrant could be useful, he offered him a contract. From 1859 to 1862, Sanchez acted as a full-time informant for the British, working for \u00a3400 a year plus bonuses based on captures resulting from his information. Sanchez worked hard. He ventured onto the docks, mingling with other merchants, sailors, caulkers; anyone who might have news. He struck up what he called \u201ccasual conversation\u201d with these men, but he was hard at work, plumbing for information. What ships were leaving for Africa? When? Who owned them? Sometimes he backed off, worrying he would \u201cexpose\u201d himself to suspicion, but he gleaned plenty of intelligence. He also thumbed through a dozen newspapers from New York and elsewhere, searching for information on ship departures and arrivals, vital clues on the whereabouts of slavers. He even recruited his brother back in Cuba to write to him about the island\u2019s trade, which was always closely tied to New York\u2019s. The result was an incredible paper trail. Sanchez wrote detailed letters to Archibald, sometimes several times a week, with the latest news. Most of his letters concerned the names of slave ships and their owners, as well as their whereabouts. A typical letter from 1859 reported a slaver disguised as whaling ship\u2014an occasional ruse of the Portuguese: \u201cLaurens: owned by Lima Viana, a Portuguese in New York\u2026fitted out [as] a whaler under the command of [captain] Curtis.\u201d In the same letter, he also informed Archibald that the Asa Fish had recently left New York \u201cloaded by a Portuguese and cleared \u2026 for Porto de Lenha [Africa]\u201d where it would \u201ctake in a cargo of slaves.\u201d  Sanchez scribbled at least 178 hundred missives in total. Fearing for his life \u2013 with good reason \u2013 he often wrote in cypher and never signed his name. Archibald was amazed by this correspondence. A few months into his work, the consul told in superiors in London that Sanchez had been in \u201calmost daily communication\u201d with him, supplying \u201cdetailed information of the movements of no fewer than fifty [slave trading] vessels.\u201d Archibald was convinced that this information was derived on \u201cextensive and authentic sources of intelligence.\u201d He was right; in all, Sanchez reported on four in every five slaving voyages that crossed the Atlantic Ocean during his tenure as a spy. Aside from the slave traders themselves, no-one knew the traffic better. Once Sanchez\u2019s letters reached Archibald, they began an extraordinary journey. The consul quickly spirited them out of New York aboard steamships bound for England. In London, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty reviewed them and sent them on another steamer, a mail packet that linked up with the British fleet off the African coast. The whole journey from New York to the British vessels off the Congo River, where the trade was centered, typically took ten weeks. The arrival of the letters gave the British squadron a crucial advantage. Because Sanchez often reported slave ships before they had departed the United States and since they were usually sailing vessels that took a long time to reach Africa, Sanchez\u2019s intel often made it to the Congo River before the slavers arrived. Armed with Sanchez\u2019s letters, including a description of incoming ships, the British knew what to look for and lay in wait. When they found the slavers lurking on the coast, they gave chase. One of these vessels was the Pamphylia, a small sailing ship built in Maine that the Portuguese Company had purchased in Boston and ran out of New York. It arrived near the Congo River late in 1859, successfully evading the British on its inbound voyage. On a remote beach, the slave traders forced over 600 men, women, and children aboard. But as they tried to sail into the Atlantic Ocean, a British cruiser approached. Its commander, who had Sanchez\u2019s information at hand, recognized the Pamphylia and fired at the ship until it surrendered. Thanks to Sanchez\u2019s notes, the voyage had failed. The capture of slavers like the Pamphylia was a blow against the slave trade. Overall, the British intercepted around 30 slave ships on Sanchez\u2019s information; some already carrying captives, others not. About 20,000 Africans avoided the crossing to the Americas, and the full misery of the middle passage. But the story was not a bright one for intercepted Africans; rather than being freed immediately, the British sent them to work temporarily as indentured laborers in the British Caribbean, thousands of miles from their homes. Meanwhile captured traders were typically dumped on the African coast, the British having neither the jurisdiction to prosecute them, nor the confidence that handing them over to American authorities would result in any action. Slave ships continued to stream out of New York. But as Sanchez labored on into the 1860s the tide was turning. Newly elected President Abraham Lincoln chased the slave traders out of Manhattan and initiated a treaty that finally allowed the British to search American ships. These efforts not only ended the slave trade in the United States, but helped close the trade to Cuba as well. The traffic withered and died within a few years. These developments also ended Britain\u2019s need for Sanchez. After refusing to pay him what he was due, the British cut him off in 1862. Embittered, Sanchez returned to his old work as a merchant in New York and New Jersey, where he lived modestly until his death 1901. His never spoke publicly about his work as a spy and seemingly took his secret to the grave. Sanchez\u2019s story and his spy letters\u2014today housed in the British National Archives in London\u2014are largely unknown to historians and the wider world. But the broader narrative is not entirely new. As historians look more closely at antislavery efforts across the United States and beyond they are seeing that people fought slavery with various motivations and in many different ways. Enslaved people were always at the center of that story, as were key figures like Lincoln or Frederick Douglass. And in the case of the illegal slave trade, so too was a Cuban immigrant, who labored night and day to bring the scourage of the Middle Passage to an end.

            "text": " The latest trends and issues around the use of open source software in the enterprise. As businesses continue to modernise their server estate and move towards cloud-native architectures, the elephant in the room is the monolithic core business application that cannot easily be rehosted without significant risk and disruption.\u00a0 These days, it is more efficient to deploy an application in a container than use a virtual machine. Computer Weekly now examines the modern trends, dynamics and challenges faced by organisations now migrating to the micro-engineered world of software containerisation. As all good software architects know, a container is defined as a \u2018logical\u2019 computing environment where code is engineered to allow a guest application to run in a state where it is abstracted away from the underlying host system\u2019s hardware and software infrastructure resources.\u00a0 So, what do enterprises need to think about when it comes to architecting, developing, deploying and maintaining software containers? This post is written by Kevin Downs in his capacity as solutions strategy director at New Relic \u2014 the company is known for its digital intelligence observability platform built to help software engineers instrument everything, then analyde, troubleshoot and optimize the software stack. Downs writes as follows\u2026 In the software delivery lifecycle, observability is the practice of collecting, visualising and applying intelligence to all of your metrics, events, logs and traces in order to gain an understanding of your software system. If monitoring tells you when something is wrong, observability lets you understand why. Observability is not a new concept, but as organisations adopt Kubernetes and move towards more complex and interconnected sets of computing resources, it is increasingly important. That is because in modern IT shops, tools can sprawl across multiple teams and sources, which can create challenges in managing and instrumenting assets in the IT estate. Consolidating all of your data into a single observability platform allows you to organise your toolbox and find the right tool for a job. Plus, by bringing together a set of disparate tools, engineering teams can achieve observability into their Kubernetes environment. This means teams can pinpoint issues in software. Many recent technologies and practices allow software professionals to deploy their production code much more frequently, including those in microservices, cloud, containers, serverless, DevOps, service reliability engineering (SRE) and infrastructure-as-code. The gains are real, but these approaches also introduce a higher degree of complexity, volatility and fragmentation of the software architecture, especially when it comes to ensuring availability, quality, performance and end-user experience. Observability addresses these challenges by rethinking monitoring techniques, an especially useful advantage when working with containers. By having a connected view of all software telemetry data, real-time observability allows us to monitor the performance of a digital architecture. It also enables transparency.\u00a0IT operations teams can achieve Kubernetes observability with a set of disparate tools that can be referred to as \u2018MELT\u2019, metrics, events, logs and traces, as well as the open source instrumentation framework Prometheus.  So let\u2019s take each of these in turn. The first element required for IT teams to achieve Kubernetes observability is metrics. Observability software needs to be able to consume metrics that diverse teams have adopted. For Kubernetes, IT teams should capture metrics for the cluster, pods and available nodes for the Kube state. Metrics are a good starting point for observability as they are low overhead to collect, inexpensive to store, dimensional for quick analysis and a great way to measure overall health. New Relic\u2019s Downs: Ice cool MELT about container orchestration. The next element, events, is often the most overlooked telemetry type, but is actually the most critical and must be part of every observability solution. Events are discrete, detailed records of significant points of analysis. Kubernetes offers a wealth of events you need to capture with our observability solution. Examples include alerts, deployments, transactions, and errors, all of which provide the ability to undertake fine-grained analysis in real time. While events and logs share some similarities, the two are often mistakenly confused. Events contain a higher level of abstraction than the level of detail provided by logs.\u00a0Logs are important in observability when an engineer is in deep debugging mode and trying to understand a problem. Logs provide high-fidelity data and detailed context around an event, so engineers can recreate what happened millisecond by millisecond, providing detailed context. Adding Kubernetes logs to the mix enhances opportunities for operators to solve problems as-and-when needed. You should make sure your observability solution allows you to filter your logs based on your need. For example, if you are troubleshooting a pod, you only really need to view logs about that pod. Traces are valuable for showing the end-to-end latency of individual calls in a distributed architecture. These calls give specific insight into the myriad customer journeys through a system. Traces enable engineers to understand those journeys, find bottlenecks and identify errors so they can be fixed and optimised. A microservices environment demands that operators, developers and site reliability engineers have access to application traces. Metrics, events and logs are all related to the individual components of your overall application environment. Traces tie all of the components together and allow for an understanding of how an application is connected and help pinpoint issues or optimisation opportunities.\u00a0 Any container-focused Kubernetes operator worth their salt is familiar with Prometheus. Prometheus is an open source instrumentation framework that can absorb massive amounts of data every second, making it well suited for complex workloads. Make sure you take advantage of Prometheus to monitor your servers, VMs, databases and use that data to analyse the performance of your applications and infrastructure. It doesn\u2019t take much to achieve observability for a Kubernetes environment. Remember, MELT, by its very nature, is a set of disparate tools.  In modern IT shops, these tools can sprawl across multiple teams and sources. Consolidating all of this data into a single observability platform allows you to organise your toolbox and quickly find the right tool for every job. Appling MELT and including available Prometheus telemetry data allows you to bring your Kubernetes environment into an overall observability solution. In doing so, your team can be confident that you can properly manage and instrument assets across the organisation. Full Kubernetes observability enables IT teams to fix issues quickly and proactively, and have a better understanding of how to prevent further issues from occurring.

Analysts said the data raised the possibility that the German economy, Europe's biggest, could be shrinking again after recovering strongly from the coronavirus pandemic downturn of early last year.  Federal statistics agency Destatis said industrial output declined 2.5 percent in January, well short of short of analyst forecasts for a 0.5 percent increase.  The economy ministry noted that a semiconductor shortage had hit Germany's vital automobile sector, forcing Volkswagen to halt production for a few days in January.  Meanwhile the construction sector \"showed a sharp decline because of unfavourable conditions\".   Temperatures fell to sharply in parts of Germany, bringing heavy snow in a cold snap that gripped Europe's biggest economy for about a week.  Compared to a year ago -- before pandemic restrictions across the world kicked in -- industrial output was down 3.9 percent in January.  Destatis meanwhile revised upwards its December output figure to show month-on-month growth of 1.9 percent, compared with its initial estimate of no change.  ING analyst Carsten Brzeski warned that January's difficulties show \"that it will be hard for industry to prevent the entire economy from falling into contraction once again.\"After several months of shutdowns, Germany has begun gradually easing restrictions, with pupils back in school since the end of February. Hairdressers opened last week, and some non-essential shops such as flower stores are due to be allowed to re-open Monday.

The Congress members had walked out of the House, claiming that the government in the state had no moral right to continue in power. \"Do we have any instance of opposition staging a walkout either in the Centre or the state during the presentation of the budget?\" Yediyurappa asked, while speaking to reporters after the budget presentation. Karnataka Budget: No rise in taxes on Petrol and Diesel \"What morality are they (Congress) talking about? I will explain what morality they were referring to during the debate on the budget,\" he said. Yediyurappa said the opposition getting away by giving lame excuses means that they are incapable to face the situation. \"Dear Siddaramaiah, your stay in the opposition forever is guaranteed. Dont call me Yediyurappa, if I dont make Siddaramaiah sit in the opposition by winning 130 to 135 seats. This I am giving in writing, an angry Yediyurappa said. When asked about Siddaramaiah demanding resignation of ministers, Yediyurappa claimed the Congress leader has developed some mental issues recently as he did not know what to speak. TN elections 2021: MNM chief Kamal Haasan alleges DMK has copied its poll promises Earlier in the day, former chief minister Siddaramaiah had said \"This government carrying a bundle of sins has no moral right to continue in power. So we have decided to protest against the presentation of the budget.\" He alleged the Chief Minister, who holds the Finance portfolio and the Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh Nirani were out on bail in a criminal case relating to creation of bogus documents to take back Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) land at Devanahalli in Bengaluru. Siddaramaiah, who is Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, also said six other ministers approached the civil court seeking injunction against the telecast or publication of any defamatory material against them by the media following the sex-for-job allegation against the BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi who had to step down as minister. \"After the telecast of Ramesh Jarkiholi (objectionable video clip), these six ministers including Shivaram Hebbar, MB Patil, Dr Sudhakar are in fear.What's their fear? Shouldn't there be some basis behind the fear?\" he said. West Bengal elections 2021: Mamata Banerjee slams PM Modi, says 'One day country will be named after PM Modi According to him, there were many more ministers whose objectionable CDs were made. The Congress veteran alleged the injunction sought by the ministers was an attack on the freedom of press. \"These ministers had taken oath saying that they would discharge their duties without any fear or favour. When they have gone to court out of fear what moral right do they have to continue in power including the Chief Minister,\" Siddaramiaah sought to know. He alleged that the government was steeped in corruption as well."

This time, the issue involves ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule and his apparent call for ANC Members of Parliament to oppose efforts to remove Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane from office. Mkhwebana is a hired gun not the public protector. Mbalula has accused Magashule of acting outside of the ANC mandate and has therefore distorted the party\u2019s image and policy. Mbalula\u2019s statement against Magashule has solicited insults from former Nelson Mandela Bay councillor Andile Lungisa, who has called the Transport minister a political prostitute.

MKMVA spokesperson Carl Niehaus has been among those who\u2019ve endorsed Lungisa\u2019s statement on Twitter. Hmmmm, so rich coming from a \"person of interest\" in the Bozwana murder. By the way, did you pay back the R1-million Bozwana loaned you for your Las Vegas frolic before he was mysteriously murdered?https://t.co/6rJ853uaFh Mbalula has not taken kindly to this and has accused Niehaus of being a criminal. The minister has previously said that members of the MKMVA are fighting with him because he stopped irregular security contracts at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) which the veterans had interests in.

Con estas dos infraestructuras que son parte de la Red Vial Estatal E-384, el Ministerio de Transporte y Obras P\u00fablicas (MTOP) promueve la reactivaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y productiva de importantes sectores de Manab\u00ed, como las poblaciones de Jun\u00edn, Calceta y Chone, enfatiz\u00f3 Iv\u00e1n Ganchozo, subsecretario Zonal 4. Agreg\u00f3 que el puente de Canuto tendr\u00e1 40 metros de longitud y el de Pimpiguas\u00ed 30 metros de longitud.  En Canuto se prev\u00e9 la hincada de 92 pilotes de 24,9 metros, en el lecho del r\u00edo Grande para lo cual  se asign\u00f3 dos excavadoras, dos volquetes, dos gr\u00faas, un mixer, personal t\u00e9cnico, conductores y operadores que trabajan 24/7.  En Pimpiguas\u00ed el hincado de 100 pilotes de 15,60 metros, sobre el lecho del r\u00edo Chico, tiene asignado una excavadora, una retroexcavadora, dos volquetes, una gr\u00faa, un mixer y el personal t\u00e9cnico, conductores y operarios. La inversi\u00f3n del Gobierno Nacional en las dos obras es de USD 5 millones, y est\u00e1 contratada con el consorcio China Road And Bridge Corporation (CRBC) \u2013 China NationalElectronicsImport&Export (CEIEC). El trabajo de los puentes implic\u00f3 el desmontaje de la estructura met\u00e1lica, previo a la construcci\u00f3n del puente Canuto, y el derrocamiento del puente de hormig\u00f3n de Pimpiguas\u00ed, en la misma RVE.  El MTOP contrat\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n de varias obras mediante contrato multimodal. Este contrato multimodal financiado por el Gobierno Nacional, a trav\u00e9s de la Secretar\u00eda de la Reconstrucci\u00f3n con el Eximbank de China,  tambi\u00e9n prev\u00e9 la edificaci\u00f3n del puente Las Golondrinas en Esmeraldas y los trabajos para la rehabilitaci\u00f3n del Aeropuerto de Manta, con una inversi\u00f3n total de USD 60 millones.   \u201cEstas obras son un compromiso presidencial con Manab\u00ed\u201d, asegur\u00f3 Ganchozo. La estructura anterior del puente Pimpiguas\u00ed generaba un represamiento que ocasionaba inundaciones en la zona. El estudio permiti\u00f3 que se eleve a 2,60 metros y el r\u00edo tenga su cauce normal. Para ejecutar los trabajos de demolici\u00f3n, se habilit\u00f3 el paso provisional considerando todas las medidas de seguridad. La obra va de acuerdo a la programaci\u00f3n y tiene un avance del 30%.  Se recomienda a los usuarios viales tener precauci\u00f3n al circular por el sector. No obstante, se colocaron reductores de velocidad (resaltos) para evitar el exceso de velocidad.

            "text": " The peacefulness of Monte Punku is disrupted every day at lunchtime, when many vehicles and hundreds of workers burst into this town located 188 kilometers (117 miles) from the city of Cochabamba. An hour later, they abandon ship and head back into Carrasco National Park, where construction is taking place on the Ivirizu hydroelectric dam. Such activity is new for those who live in this town in the municipality of Pocona. It all started when the Chinese company Sinohydro built a camp in the area, widened the road and cleared part of the forest where the dam will be built. The company got the $172 million contract in September 2017, and will clear 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of forest within the protected area, Pocona Mayor Juan Carlos Rodr\u00edguez confirmed during a visit by Mongabay Latam in 2018. Many have wondered how such a large project within a protected area was approved, but in 2016, the Bolivian government was able to declare the project as being in the national interest, by invoking Law 819. That same year, the Environment Ministry approved the environmental license. The Bolivian government hopes that the 290 megawatts that the project will generate will help it achieve its plan to export energy to neighboring countries, such as Brazil and Argentina. However, according to experts that Mongabay Latam consulted, producing this energy will come at a high cost for the area\u2019s biodiversity, due to its fragility and the impact on the highly diverse flora and fauna. For locals, though, the main concerns center on jobs and the location of energy transmission towers. Meanwhile, the National Electricity Company (ENDE) insists that mitigation plans will minimize the impact on biodiversity. During Mongabay\u2019s visit, the road that joins Monte Punku to the southern end of Carrasco National Park, open since before the park was declared a protected area in 1991, was closed. The park is now accessible by a road that runs parallel, which is narrower and more accident-prone, and that leads to the Sinohydro workers\u2019 barracks. When entering the forest within the protected area, the first thing one notices is the constant bustle of trucks coming and going, transporting materials, kicking up dust, and making a lot of noise. In narrow spaces, the trucks pull over by the side to let other vehicles pass through. In some areas, tree trunks and branches have been piled up on either side. According to the contract with Sinohydro, when the job is done the road will be improved and widened, since it will provide access to the hydroelectric project. Past the first bridge, the green mountains introduce visitors to the impressive vegetation that is central to the park. According to the National Service for Protected Areas\u2019 (Sernap) Atlas of Protected Areas, Carrasco National Park is home to 247 species of birds, although experts estimate that the real number could in fact be around 700. Changes to this natural area keep appearing further along the road, which is set to be widened to 6 meters (20 feet) for the first 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) and to 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) along the final 30 kilometers (18.6 miles). Behind a sign that reads \u201cStorage Area 3\u201d lies a pile of logs, while further on, a giant mechanical shovel dumps earth into a truck. This road was used by local famers, but they\u2019re not the only ones. The road also leads to the Yungas de Vandiola community whose inhabitants farm coca on the fringes of the protected area \u2014 and within it. According to a 2016 report from the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), these plantations have spread across 642 hectares (1,586 acres) within this park, one of the most biodiverse protected areas in Bolivia. Carrasco National Park contains a variety of ecosystems due to its varied topography, which ranges in elevation from 300 meters up to 4,700 meters (1,000 to 15,400 feet) above sea level. This accounts for its high level of biodiversity. As of 2017, 614 species of plants had been identified. However, Sernap estimates that the real figure is more than 3,000, and particularly noteworthy are the walnut and pine groves (que\u00f1ua and p\u00e1ramo yungue\u00f1o trees). The park is a genetic reservoir for commercially important trees such as Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata) and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and is home to 300 species of orchids, 50 of which are endemic. Rodr\u00edguez, the mayor of Pocona, confirmed to Mongabay Latam that a large area of forest will have to be cleared for the dam, but adds, \u201cThis why we have the mitigation and reforestation policy.\u201d The plan also requires that the course of the Ivirizu River be diverted. For Carmen Capriles, an agronomist and environmental activist, deforestation and construction will also affect the natural cycles of animals. The project area is home to animals such as jaguars (Panthera onca) and Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus), Capriles said, adding that no one knows the extent to which other species that live in the park could be affected, given that it\u2019s in an area that hasn\u2019t been well studied. The few studies that have been conducted in the park confirm the presence of endangered and endemic species such as the Sehuencas water frog (Telmatobius yuracare), which is in danger of going extinct. But Mayor Rodr\u00edguez said the work is being regulated so that \u201cthe project doesn\u2019t greatly affect the flora and fauna.\u201d Still, he acknowledged that, \u201clike any project, it will have an impact one way or another.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said this is why they will enforce the mitigation measures: \u201cThe biodiversity that we have in there, the lizards, frogs, toads and all the bugs, [the plan] specifies that they must be transferred with great care to safer areas of their natural habitat so that they are not damaged.\u201d Mongabay Latam contacted experts like biologist Lilian Apaza at the No\u00ebl Kempff Mercado Natural History Museum, who questioned which of the great diversity of fauna will be transferred. Apaza noted that in Colombia there have been cases of transfer, but monitoring has been done with only a few species, and there is no scientific and systematic documentation that defines successful cases. Vincent Vos, a biologist at the Center for Research and Promotion of Farmers, said that in Europe, whole streams including fish and amphibians have been moved, and that there are some examples of relocation of mammals and birds, but that the results have been somewhat questionable. He said he considers it unlikely that they can move the fauna from the affected area in Carrasco National Park, taking into account the technical difficulties with catching them, the high cost, and the ecological limitations. Another difficulty that both Vos and Apaza noted is that many species are territorial and that the vast majority would die if reintroduced in another area. Biologist Donovan Osorio criticized the notion of generating energy in order to export it, especially in an area of such high ecological sensitivity that is also a national park. Although the full details of the mitigation plan were not fully disclosed before Mongabay-Latam published this story, it was clear that the use of dynamite was being considered, since a license for use of hazardous substances was approved. Mongabay Latam asked Energy Minister Rafael Alarc\u00f3n at a press conference about the mitigation measures being considered for the Ivirizu project. He said everything had already been decided regarding the design and environmental license, without giving further details. \u201cThere is a set of actions that are being coordinated \u2026 to mitigate the environmental impact,\u201d he said. President Evo Morales has a goal of turning Bolivia into the energy center of the region, and at least five more hydroelectric plants will be built in the department of Cochabamba, in addition to Chepete-El Bala (La Paz) and Rositas (Santa Cruz), which are two of the largest. That plan moved closer to reality when Minister Alarc\u00f3n announced at the press conference that the Juana Azurduy de Padilla transmission line to Argentina would soon be ready to, for the first time, send Bolivian electricity abroad.

Yin said expanding travel restrictions to reduce the proliferation of COVID-19 has been proven successful to \u201cas an effective approach to contain the spread of the virus\u201d. Yin was asked whether The Bahamas should move to restrict travel to and from the United States given the nearly 4,000 cases and 69 deaths across 12 states. He replied: \u201cTalking about whether the United States would be on the list of the travel ban is totally up to the Bahamian government to make the decision.\u201d Social distancing The embassy, which has been in close communication with the Chinese community in The Bahamas, has recommended limiting people-to-people contact, and encouraged, where possible, to self-contain. \u201cWe have recommended the Chinese people to stay at home and prevent long trips like taking flights from The Bahamas to China because closed spaces is easy for the virus to spread,\u201d Yin said. Asked if this was a recommendation of self-quarantine, Yin said: \u201cNo. Actually, we suggest for them to take prevention measures in their daily lives. For example, hygiene of the body and reduce attending parties or going to places where they have a lot of people and also we recommend for them to avoid some long trips by flight.\u201d When asked whether the embassy has recommended Chinese businesses consider temporarily closing, Yin said: \u201cI think at this moment we need to follow the recommendations of the government.\u201d He said: \u201cAbout the operation of the businesses of the Chinese community, we ask them to keep alert on the those people who have some symptoms; to keep away from those who have coughs or some similar symptoms.\u201d NASSAU, BAHAMAS \u2014 As part of its growing bilateral relations, The Bahamas will be among the beneficiaries of China\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine when approved for general use, according to Counselor at the Chinese Embassy Haigang Yin.

They account for 21.6% of the sector\u2019s large-scale projects under construction. The key role of a Chinese engineering firm in the sole consortium bidding on the Portezuelo del Viento project highlights the continued involvement of Chinese firms in Argentina\u2019s power sector and in Argentina\u2019s infrastructure sector more broadly, according to a note from Fitch Solutions. In recent years, Chinese firms have taken an increasingly significant role in Argentina\u2019s power sector, with involvement in most of the largest projects undertaken. According to data from Fitch\u2019s database, Chinese firms account for 21.6% of construction roles on large-scale power projects ($50m and above) in planning or under construction in the market. The Portezuelo del Viento tender could mean that Chinese firms will remain highly active in the market over the next several years. With their higher risk tolerance and strong backing from banks and the government, Chinese firms are expected to pose strong competition for other international firms active in the country\u2019s power market. \u201cThis strong involvement will be built on a growing presence and familiarity with the market evidenced by the projects already being developed by Chinese firms in the country, as well as a strong relationship between the governments of Argentina and China which should facilitate continued involvement,\u201d the report stated. Some more of these projects include the 75MW El Tambolar hydropower project awarded in 2019, as well as the the 315MW Cauchari I, II and III solar projects in Jujuy and the 355MW Lomo Blanca I, II, III and IV and Miramar wind power projects in Chubut.  ...there are many ways you can work with us to advertise your company and connect to your customers.

Officials and foreign investors are considering construction of the 156-m high Rositas Dam project near its exit from the Andes that would flood ~100 km of the lowermost river with its jungle canyons and big-water rapids, displace indigenous communities, stop nutritious sediment from passing downstream to the Amazon, and destroy the habitat of a variety of fauna dependent on the river.\u00a0 The river carries one of the highest sediment loads in the world and would fill in a reservoir with dirt within 30 years, meaning the life of the dam and project is so short as to make it a terrible investment. Government officials in Bolivia should know that this project and all other dam projects proposed on R\u00edo Grande are ill-conceived due to the short useful lifespans and the resulting destruction to the environment.\u00a0 On the contrary, due to the river's navigability by raft, fun rapids, diverse ecosystems, fine beach camps, unique side excursions, interesting flora/fauna and friendly residents, it is sure to become one of the premier tourist destinations in the world should it remain a free-flowing river without dams.\u00a0 R\u00edo Grande Sin Represas!

Detailed PBL practices adoption and the perception by the students of the PBL process are explored in survey research using a mixed-methods approach. The data was collected in two subsequent semesters of the L&T course, with different PBL scenarios and students, gathering quantitative and qualitative data. It was demonstrated that aligned with the theory on PBL, the majority of the students, over 91%, appreciated the benefits of the PBL-based practices in all course dimensions, with a strong perception of L&T teaching and learning improvements. Researchers and faculty involved in university teaching and learning can use PBL detailed practices, including problem scenarios and theoretical framework to design their own PBL classes to improve student learning and can also use the questionnaire structure and statistical tests for adoption in future implementations. The study is one of the few to provide a change in teaching and learning practices, associated with a valid and reliable two-stage survey covering the course concepts and learning objectives modelled by Factor Analysis, and, going beyond to provide PBL process impact and adaptations due to COVID-19 pandemic.  \n        Guimar\u00e3es, L., \n            & \n        Lima, R.\n    (2021).\n    Changes in teaching and learning practice in an undergraduate logistics and transportation course using problem-based learning.\n    Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice, 18(3).\n        https://ro.uow.edu.au/jutlp/vol18/iss3/012\n 163 DOWNLOADS Since March 07, 2021 \nPlum Print visual indicator of research metricsPlumX MetricsUsageAbstract Views: 211Downloads: 167CapturesReaders: 10Social MediaTweets: 1see details\n \nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nAddThis\n \n\n\t\t\tAdvanced Search\n\t\t\n \nHome | \n        About | \n        FAQ | \n        My Account | \n        Accessibility Statement\n \nPrivacy\nCopyright\n"

            "text": " cameraImage Credits: Koinz As the restaurant industry across different cities was massively hit by the pandemic-induced lockdowns last year, food aggregator platforms helped by driving online customers to them. Koinz is one such startup in Egypt. Its value for food and beverages brands before, during and after the lockdowns has bagged the startup a $4.8 million seed round. Founded in 2018 by Hussein Momtaz, Ahmed Said and Abdullah Al Khaldi, Koinz set out to solve two major problems in Egypt\u2019s food aggregation industry. The offline and online food and restaurant experience in the country are totally separate. Most food aggregators who deal with delivery tend to focus on the online customer, and there\u2019s no sophisticated experience for the offline customer. Next, the unit economics of the food aggregation industry is quite challenging. According to Momtaz, the startup\u2019s CEO, the food aggregation industry usually takes about 25%-30% average commission from F&B players for business to start to make sense. \u201cThis is not because they want to squeeze money from the hands of restaurants or brands,\u201d Momtaz told TechCrunch. \u201cBut the cost of acquiring customers and retaining them for the food aggregator itself is very high; that\u2019s why they need very high commissions from the brands or restaurants.\u201d This is where Koinz comes in. The company developed a mobile app for takeout and delivery orders that manages offline customer experiences while delivering an engagement platform to manage loyalty programs, customer feedback and analytics about the online and offline customer base. Abdullah Al Khaldi (CRO), Hussein Momtaz (CEO), and Ahmed Said (CTO). Image Credits: Koinz Abdullah Al Khaldi (CRO), Hussein Momtaz (CEO), and Ahmed Said (CTO). Image Credits: Koinz Online food experience for Koinz customers is like a treasure hunt, and Momtaz claims the company\u2019s business model has cracked the industry\u2019s unit economics. This, alongside providing brands with insights, differentiates the platform from other aggregators and makes its customer acquisition cost and retention cost 60% less than most of them. Here\u2019s how the platform works. When customers visit a brand using for the first time, they enter their phone numbers to instantly receive points for their order via text message. After various restaurant visits and making orders, they accumulate enough points. They\u2019ll need to download the Koinz mobile application to redeem them, thereby converting these offline customers to online ones. Furthermore, these offline customers can now discover new places to eat, read and leave reviews, and order delivery or takeout. Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020  \u201cNone of the small or big brands in the region had something like this before. The offline customer is like a ghost. He walks into the brands, takes his orders and leaves without the brands knowing anything about him. Koinz is changing that,\u201d the CEO remarked. Building its platform this way, Koinz tries to be different from other online aggregators that erode restaurant owners\u2019 profit margins while delivering limited customer access and interaction. How? By collecting real-time data and leveraging a digital rewarding system designed to drive customers to deepen their relationship with restaurants. Image Credits: Koinz Image Credits: Koinz Brands can configure their gifts lists and determine for which items customers can redeem their points. For instance, customers in an Egyptian restaurant called Buffalo Burger can exchange 68 points for a Diablo Fries Medium; or wait till they get to 160 points to get a Mozzarella Sticks Medium; or 236 points for a Double Diggler. Similarly, every brand has its own configuration. A customer cannot get points in Buffalo Burger and redeem them at Hamburgini. Koinz charges subscriptions to the brands for its engagement and feedback platform and collects commission whenever an order is made via its platform, which varies across its markets. Because of its original business model, Koinz had to iterate several times. Before using phone numbers to collect customers\u2019 information, the company used QR codes and NFC tags. Momtaz says this was highly ineffective, and the move to phone numbers helped skyrocket its growth and value. The six-man team back in 2018 is now 80, and the platform, which is basically powering the growth of restaurants in the Middle East, claims to have had up to 4 million consumers earn points on its platform. These consumers have redeemed almost 300,000 rewards, while almost 800,000 customers have left reviews. Since launching in Egypt, Koinz has expanded to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Like Egypt, these markets have similar dynamics and demographics. They have also witnessed one of the highest rates of new or increased users in online deliveries \u2014 restaurant products and groceries \u2014 during the pandemic. Besides, consumers in the Middle East are outpacing the global appetite in food delivery, with 64% ordering in at least once a week compared to 40% made by global consumers. And with the fast-food industry in MENA estimated at nearly $31 billion in 2020 and expected to reach nearly $60 billion by 2025, there\u2019s so much room for Koinz to grow in the region. Momtaz says the company is also considering a move to Sub-Saharan Africa in the near future despite them having distinct demographics. Entrepreneur and investor Justin Mateen led this seed round. Since leaving Tinder in 2014, Mateen has been an active investor in early-stage companies. Koinz is his first investment in the MENA region. According to him, Koinz\u2019s ability to allow food and beverages brands to understand their customers\u2019 needs and simultaneously increase their profit margins was one of the reasons he invested in the Egyptian-based startup. Uber vet raises $5.2M for blue-collar logistics marketplace  \u201cThe company\u2019s unique business model will continue to scale as the food delivery space evolves. Hussein\u2019s drive and excitement for what the team is building are what convinced me to lead a round in the Middle East for the first time,\u201d Mateen added. African-focused VC 4DX Ventures and strategic angel investors from Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia participated as well. Peter Orth, co-founder and managing director of the firm, said of the investment that with restaurants in the region suffering under the traditional aggregator model, especially during the pandemic, Koinz has quickly become a win-win for both consumers and restaurant owners across the Middle East. As the three-year-old company plans to use the capital to hire more talent and fuel its expansion across the Middle East, Mateen and Orth will join its board of directors.

In the coming months, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) is set to deliver its report on a Guyana\u2013Brazil transport link and a deepwater port project for the northern coast. Today, the Runupuni border town of Lethem is a 14-hour ride along dirt roads from the Guyanese capital, Georgetown. Red dirt is set to be placed by asphalt and Lethem converted into a major trading hub. China is expected to provide the required capital and carry out construction work. Representatives of both countries referenced the untendered project at a July 2018 ceremony at which Guyana signed up to China\u2019s Belt & Road Initiative (BRI). As part of the ambitious global connectivity plan, China has promised US$250bn for Latin American infrastructure projects. Chinese firms have developed infrastructure projects in Guyana before, but the port and road project would be the largest yet. The Guyana road link highlights the strategic nature of the small country to China\u2019s plans in Latin America. It would cut transport times to northern Brazil, China\u2019s biggest trading partner in the region, by providing a faster route to the Panama Canal.     \u201cChina sees Guyana as a conduit to northern Brazil,\u201d said Sasenerine Singh, a former opposition politician and financial analyst. \u201cA road link from Manaus to Guyana would cut thousands of kilometres off the shipping route along the Amazon River. The Guyanese government doesn\u2019t have the finances or capacity, only China has the resources and long-term vision to undertake such a project.\u201d The terms of financing, rather than its country of origin, is the crucial factor, according to Carl Greenidge, Minister of Foreign Affairs. Guyana became one of the world\u2019s most heavily indebted countries in the 1980s when falling sugar and bauxite prices crippled state-run companies. \u201cNo country is more aware of the cost of unsustainable debt that we are. We are alert to the problem and know what we need to do,\u201d he told Di\u00e1logo Chino, in an interview. But Guyana\u2019s financial situation is on the brink of major change. The country is announcing infrastructure investments are just as it is poised to become one of the world\u2019s top oil producers per capita. In recent years ExxonMobil has discovered over 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil off the coast of Guyana. Chinese oil firm CNOOC holds a 25% stake in ExxonMobil\u2019s Starbroek block, the most advanced project. China\u2019s footprint in oil and other sectors looks set to grow following Guyana\u2019s general election in March. The election was triggered by a December no confidence vote in the government of David Granger, leader of the People\u2019s National Congress (PNC) party, which came to power in 2015 as part of the wider Partnership for National Unity alliance (APNU). \u201cWhen the APNU was in opposition it expressed concern about China\u2019s growing footprint in Guyana and questioned its motives but now they are in power, all ministers seem to be welcoming of China,\u201d said Abena Rockcliffe, a senior journalist at Kaieteur News, a local paper. Granger has been somewhat sceptical of foreign ownership of natural resources and revoked BaiShanLin\u2019s logging concession in 2016 after the Chinese firm broke the terms of its agreement. Granger has suffered with ill-health, however, leaving Joseph Harmon \u2013 a more China-friendly politician \u2013a strong candidate to run for the PNC. The opposition People\u2019s Progressive Party (PPP), which held power from 1992 to 2015 have also proved open to Chinese investment in the past. Based on our recent experience with Chinese investments, it seems Guyana is always left holding the dirty end of the stick China Harbour Engineering won the contract to expand Cheddi Jagan airport in 2011 and Chinese firms account for seven out of eleven bids submitted for the construction of a bridge over the wide Demerara River. China Railway First Group also won a US$500m contract for the 165MW Amalia Falls hydroelectric plant in 2012 \u2013 a project currently on hold. Last year, construction began on a Chinese-owned manganese mine. In September, during a visit from China\u2019s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, Guyana signed agreements on greater financial integration. The Guyanese assets of two foreign banks \u2013 Canada\u2019s Scotia Bank and India\u2019s Baroda Bank \u2013 are currently up for sale. Chinese banks are the most likely suitors. Yet, as Chinese-led projects mount, so do questions about what Guyana has to gain by deepening ties with China. \u201cBased on our recent experience with Chinese investments, it seems Guyana is always left holding the dirty end of the stick,\u201d said Rockcliffe. \u201cIn the projects to date we have seen very little use of local labour, no transfer of skills, project over-runs and allegations of corruption.\u201d The Brazil transport link would dwarf previous projects and open up development of the country\u2019s interior, thought to hold important deposits of gold, bauxite and rare earths. It could also jeopardise Guyana\u2019s 2017 Green State Development Strategy, which called for sustainable management of natural resources, expansion of environmental services and a transition to renewable energy. In 2009, Norway pledged US$250m to Guyana over the course of five years to protect its rainforests and in October Guyana announced its lowest deforestation rate since 1990. \u201cIn a country that is 90% forest, any major infrastructure project will have an environmental impact,\u201d said Greenidge. \u201cWe have a responsibility to minimise that impact but we cannot commit to not building infrastructure that allows for the provision of jobs and services to our isolated communities.\u201d Guyana has under a million inhabitants and one of the lowest levels of GDP per capita on the continent. With a history of rigged elections and corruption scandals, the country\u2019s institutions are weak, casting doubt on whether regulators have the capacity to successfully mitigate negative environmental impacts. The same institutional weakness, combined with a history of corruption and opaque negotiations suggests that Guyana could provide a malleable ally for China in the South American Caribbean. \u201cThe government has not given enough information about the terms of Chinese loans and investments and have dodged reporters\u2019 questions,\u201d said Rockcliffe. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in other countries that once China has a foot in a country, they move aggressively.\u201d \u00a0 \n            You can republish our articles for free under the Creative Commons licence.\n           \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Impacts and innovations in a key sector for China and Latin America  Mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to cleaner economies   Natural resources and responsible extraction   Bridging Latin America's infrastructure gap sustainably   The drivers, actors and institutions behind the billions  Follow A chinadialogue partner site.\nFind out more\n Dialogo Chino uses cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

The work will be financed with a credit of 21 million U.S. dollars from the Export-Import Bank of China and a local contribution of 4.5 million dollars. \"...We are starting a project that has been waiting for a long time,\" the president said at a ceremony held at the airport in Manabi Province. The reconstruction is expected to be completed in one year and a half and will benefit the local people and the local economy, said Moreno. Ecuadorian Transport and Public Works Minister Aurelio Hidalgo said that the airport will be rebuilt by a consortium of two Chinese firms. Once completed, it will have two runways that will be able to accommodate a Boeing 747-400, added the minister. The earthquake on April 16, 2016 destroyed the airport facilities, including the control tower. Since then emergency repairs have been done and a temporary terminal was constructed so the airport operations could continue.

It will contribute to long term social and economic development of this beautiful country.\u201d\nThe Chinese diplomat said the new hospital will be \u201cone of the most complicated and challenging project to construct for both sides\u2026thanks to the tremendous efforts put in by both sides\u201d.\nPrime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said that the new facility should serve as an impetus for Dominicans to put aside their political differences and unite for the socio-economic development of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country.\n\u201cI need more ambassadors for Dominica from Dominica. It is amazing ladies and gentlemen that we travel and hear the most delightful things foreigners say about this country and then you read what is advanced by persons whose navel strings are buried right here on this island.\n\u201cIt is absolutely amazing some of the things they say.

The project marks the biggest Chinese investment in the Caribbean to date and officials said there\u2019s more to come. CCTV America\u2019s Roee Ruttenberg reports from the Kingston, Jamaica.  The new toll road known as the North-South Highway will directly connect the Jamaican capital Kingston, in the south with the resort beach city of Ocho Rios, in the north, reducing a two-hour drive by less than half. The project included a $730 million from China and more than 1,000 Chinese workers and 1,000 local Jamaicans spent three years building it. The difficult terrain required creative engineering solutions. The highway, it\u2019s hoped, will play a crucial role in helping resuscitate Jamaica\u2019s economy that\u2019s been burdened by large interest payments to international creditors that have left little room for domestic government spending. Jamaica gave the China Harbour Engineering Company, which built the highway, a 50-year concession to recover its costs. The company also received land alongside the highway to develop for residential and commercial use which could mean more jobs and more growth in the near future. And there are plans for more, including a new deep-water shipping port with an investment amount that could be double the cost of the highway. Opening a three-day trip to the Caribbean and Central America, U.S. President Barack Obama hopes to capitalize on mutual needs in the face of expanding Chinese influence and weakening power by Venezuela, once the energy juggernaut of the Americas.

Ltd. (BCEG) and implemented byLake Asphalt of Trinidad and Tobago (1978) Limited and Evolving Tecknologies and Enterprise Development Company Limited (eTeck). BCEG\u2019s representatives as part of a delegation led by Vice Mayor of Beijing, His Excellency Wang Ning, visited Trinidad and Tobago and toured both the pitch lake and the proposed site for the development a new industrial estate at Phoenix Park, Point Lisas. On Monday June 18, 2018, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Mr Zhang Chuancheng Deputy General Manager, BCEG and Mr Steve De Las President of eTeck for the development of the Phoenix Park Industrial Estate. In discussions with the Vice Mayor who also witnessed the signing, the Minister of Trade and Industry Senator the Honourable Paula Gopee-Scoon stated that \u201cthe signing serves to deepen the commercial relations between the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d She added that, \u201cThese events are significant for the Ministry of Trade and Industry since they open the way for new commercial and foreign direct investments into Trinidad and Tobago which are fundamentally important to this country\u2019s economic development.\u201d According to the Minister of Trade and Industry, \u201cOnce fully operational, the new park would provide space for 60 to 80 factory shells, directly employ over 4,500 persons with one thousand persons expected to be employed during the construction phase.\u201d The Minister also indicated that the development of the new industrial park should be completed within 12 months and one major international investor has already been identified for the site. She added that the park\u2019s establishment promotes Government\u2019s diversification efforts as it targets firms in the areas of high-value and light manufacturing, logistics/warehousing, and emerging industries \u2013 electronic technology, information technology, energy-saving ecological building materials and biotechnology. The Park will be financed through a loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the amount of US$104,295,000. The Beijing Construction Engineering Group has guaranteed the operations of at least ten (10) Chinese firms. To date, there is interest in the areas of manufacturing of glass powder, air conditioners and ceramics, paper converting operations, wood processing, communication equipment, building materials, integrated housing manufacturing and food processing. Further the company has committed to use 60% local labour among the total labour in construction and purchase at least 50% of the building materials in Trinidad and Tobago. In delivering remarks on behalf of the Government at the signing ceremony, Minister of Communications the Honourable Stuart Young expressed appreciation for the responsiveness of the Chinese Government and its investors and their reciprocal visit coming one month after the Prime Minister\u2019s visit to China in May. He highlighted Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s lead role as the first country in the region to sign on to the Belt and Road Initiative being implemented by the Chinese Government. Senator the Honourable Dennis Moses, Minister of Foreign and CARICOM Affairs in welcoming the delegation expressed the hope that the activity signalled the commencement of a long and fruitful relationship of the signatories in an environment where robust cooperation was demonstrated. A distributorship agreement between Lake Asphalt of Trinidad and Tobago (1978) Limited and the BCEG was also signed which the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries, Senator the Honourable Franklin Khan, added would increase the marketing of the company\u2019s products substantially in that particular region. The initiative, he added, would transform Lake Asphalt of Trinidad and Tobago (1978) Limited into a more profitable venture with marketing and packaging arrangements in place. He identified the Government\u2019s plans to construct a bitumen powder plant which would convert the world class bitumen produced by Lake Asphalt of Trinidad and Tobago (1978) Limited into an exportable powder form and yield significant profits.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Reuters Staff 5 Min Read DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States on Monday expressed alarm at \u201cgenuine security threats\u201d to Saudi Arabia from Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthis and elsewhere in the region after attacks on the heart of the Saudi oil industry, and it would look at improving support for Saudi defences. Earlier in the day, the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh said Washington was committed to defending Saudi following Sunday\u2019s volley of drones and missiles, including one aimed at a Saudi facility vital to oil exports. \u201cWe continue to be alarmed by the frequency of Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia. Escalating attacks like these are not the actions of a group that is serious about peace,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. \u201cWe understand that they face genuine security threats from Yemen and others in the region...We will look for ways to improve support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to defend its territory against threats,\u201d Psaki told a Washington news briefing. Saudi-led coalition authorities said most of Sunday\u2019s drones and missiles were intercepted en route to their targets and there were no casualties or property losses from the attacks. They targeted an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, site of a refinery and the world\u2019s biggest offshore oil-loading facility, and a residential compound in Dhahran used by state-controlled oil giant Saudi Aramco. [L1N2L502H] The attacks, which drove Brent crude prices above $70 a barrel to their highest since January 2020, come at a time of friction in the decades-old alliance between Saudi Arabia and the United States as President Joe Biden puts pressure on Riyadh over its human rights record and the ruinous Yemen war. \u201cThe United States stands by Saudi Arabia and its people. Our commitment to defend the kingdom and its security is firm,\u201d the U.S. Embassy said in an Arabic-language Twitter post. The Houthis have been battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for six years in a conflict largely regarded as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. In new incidents on Monday, the coalition said it had intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile and an explosive drone fired towards parts of the kingdom\u2019s southern region. The Houthi military claimed to have hit a military target at Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abha airport, near the Yemen border, with a new type of ballistic missile. Related Coverage  Saudi Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki, who also speaks for the coalition, said on Al Arabiya TV that Iran was smuggling missiles and drones to the Houthis. The Houthis and Tehran have in the past rejected such charges. [D5N2JU016] Riyadh has repeatedly said that Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme and support for regional proxies including in Yemen should be part of any talks aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran that Biden\u2019s predecessor Donald Trump quit. The Houthi movement said its operation on Sunday using 14 drones and eight ballistic missiles also attacked military targets in the Saudi cities of Dammam, Asir and Jazan. The coalition said it destroyed 12 Houthi drones, without specifying locations in the kingdom, and two ballistic missiles launched towards Jazan. The Saudi Defence Ministry later said it had intercepted an armed drone coming from the sea before it could hit its target at Ras Tanura. Shrapnel from a ballistic missile fell near the residential compound used by Aramco. The two sites in Eastern Province are located on the Gulf coast across from Iran and near Iraq and Bahrain, which is the regional base of the U.S. Navy. Yemen lies nearly 1,000 km (600 miles) southwest on the Gulf of Aden. Eastern Province has most of Aramco\u2019s production and export facilities. In 2019, Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, was shaken by a big attack on oil installations just a few km (miles) from the facilities targeted on Sunday, which Riyadh blamed on Iran, an accusation Tehran denies. The 2019 attack, which was claimed by the Houthis but which Riyadh said did not originate from Yemen, forced Saudi Arabia to temporarily shut more than half of its crude output. The United States later sent American troops and military equipment to bolster the kingdom\u2019s air and missile defences. The Houthis have stepped up attacks as the United States and United Nations have been pushing for a ceasefire to revive stalled Yemen peace talks. Biden has declared a halt to U.S. support for coalition offensive operations in Yemen but said Washington would continue to help Saudi Arabia defend itself. On Sunday, the Saudi-led coalition said the Houthis were emboldened after the Biden administration revoked terrorist designations on the group imposed by Trump.

The 13 story New Block will include a 540-bed tower, a coronary unit, a 6-bed plastic surgery unit and provide medical, psychiatric, pediatric and ancillary services. This billion-dollar facility will replace the old block built in 1962, which was condemned due to its aged structure and damage from the August 2018 earthquake.  It is expected to provide much needed health care services to the Capital\u2019s residents and visiting population. Dr Rowley in his feature address said that healthcare is priority number one and the construction of this building will contribute to the government\u2019s plan to provide proper healthcare infrastructure across the entire country.  The Prime Minister was joined by the Minister of Health, the Honourable Terrence Deyalsingh and Ms Lisa Agard, Chairman of the North West Regional Health Authority at the ceremony. In May 2019, the Government signed the agreement with Shanghai Construction Group Caribbean Limited for the construction of the project, which will be completed through a public-private partnership. \u00a0 \n Follow @newsgovtt   Browse Gazette Archives  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Copyright \u00a9 2021  Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago"

            "text": " ANDY Ngo is an American right-wing journalist and social media personality. He commonly writes about antifa - the left-wing political movement that Donald Trump has branded a \"terrorist organization\". Here is what we know about Ngo.  Andy Ngo describes himself as an independent journalist and photographer. He was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, and is believed to be in his early to mid-thirties. His parents were boat people who fled Vietnam by sea in the wake of the Vietnam War. Ngo began his career as an editor at his student newspaper, The Vanguard, at Portland State University.  He was reportedly dismissed after posting a video which violated journalism ethics on Twitter.  He has gone on to write about anti-fascist groups and Islam, and his work is widely considered highly controversial.  In 2019, Ngo covered a march organized by Proud Boys - the far-right, neo-fascist, and male-only white nationalist organization. While reporting, he was attacked by far-left counter protesters. He claimed that antifa activists threw a milkshake filled with concrete at him and he suffered a head injury.  Ngo has also made contentious statements about the Black Lives Matter movement, particularly following the killing of George Floyd.  His outspokenness on controversial topics has helped him amass a significant following, with 765,000 followers on Twitter. But he has been heavily criticised by others for sharing misleading and false information. Others have accused him of publishing selectively edited videos to paint antifa activists as violent, and to downplay the violence of the far-right. Facebook fact-checker has rated some of Ngo's statements about antifa as \"false\".  He is often described as right-wing and conservative, but he describes himself as center-right.  He came out as gay in the mid 2010s.  Andy Ngo has released a book called Unmasked, which reveals \"antifa's radical plan to destroy democracy\".  In it, he refers to the Proud Boys as a \u201cpro-Trump fraternity\u201d and left-wing activists as a \u201cmarauding gang\u201d whose mission is to \u201cdestroy the nation-state, America in particular\u201d. English band Mumford & Sons are in hot water on Twitter after banjoist and guitarist Winston Marshall tweeted a photo praising Ngo's new release.  On March 6, Marshall shared a picture of the book, writing: \u201cCongratulations @MrAndyNgo. Finally had the time to read your important book. You\u2019re a brave man.\u201d Marshall's tweet was deleted the following day on March 7, but fans were quick criticise the band, with some threatening to 'cancel' them. One Twitter user said: \u201cThis is so damn disappointing and really reinforces all the bad stereotypes about what it means when you hear \u2018the sound of banjos.\u2019 Supporting fascism ain't a good look.\u201d Another added: \u201cImagine if being in Mumford and Sons was only the second most embarrassing thing you've done.\u201d A third chimed in, saying: \u201cA dumbfounding endorsement of fascism. Shame, I really liked that one song a while ago.\u201d Mumford & Sons have been playing together since 2007 and have won numerous awards since the release of their first studio album, Sigh No More. They have not yet issued a statement regarding the controversy of the tweet.

The Competition Commission referred the matter for prosecution last year after it accused the Gauteng-based Tsutsumani Business Enterprise of excessive pricing among other contraventions of the Competition Act. The SAPS urgently acquired 500,000 masks at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown. In its argument, the commission said Tsutsumani exploited the SAPS\u2019 desperation as the personal protective equipment products were scarce at the time. The company is also accused of anti-competitive behaviour after charging above-market prices and ignoring evidence when presented with competitive pricing.

            "text": " The Trinidad and Tobago government will spend a total of TT $1.2 billion (US $178 million) towards the construction of a new airport terminal at the ANR Robinson International Airport in Crown Point, Tobago. As the twin island seeks to revitalize its tourism sector, one of the necessary projects would have been the upgrade of the current terminal which is in dire need of modernization. At the signing event held at the departure lounge of the airport, it was announced that a totally new passenger terminal will be constructed at the cost of TT $870 million. The existing building will eventually be transformed into a dedicated cargo and general aviation facility at the cost of TT $36 million, according to Minister of Finance Colm Imbert. According to Minister Imbert, two contracts were awarded to China Railway Construction Caribbean Limited. Out of all the bids for the tender, they were the only company satisfying the conditions set out during the tender process. The government has also allocated an additional TT $300 million towards land acquisition totaling 53 acres, targeting properties running along the airport perimeter fence starting from Store Bay Local Road. The new terminal will bring a number of upgrades over the existing facility, including fully air conditioned facilities, duty-free shopping, a food and drinks area, and other retail facilities associated with most larger airports. The airport will be able to handle a much larger number of passengers, and facilities such as baggage handling, parking, and pick-up and drop-off zones will also be upgraded. There will also be a proper lounge for VIP travelers. The apron will be capable of handling up to five wide body aircraft (including Boeing 747s and Airbus A330s), with four additional spots for smaller turboprop aircraft (mainly for Caribbean Airlines ATR service). Tobago House of Assembly Chief Secretary Kelvin Charles mentioned that the new terminal was a critical step in rebuilding tourism on the island, noting that it could open new opportunities to expand within the region, and also improve the experience for those traveling between Trinidad and Tobago. The project is expected to be completed within two years. In the mean time, passengers will still utilize the old terminal until the construction process is completed.

            "text": "  The two primary schools that performed best in final year exams in three core subjects over the past decade will be shut under a Government proposal to transform the education system. St George\u2019s Prep and St David\u2019s PS topped a table of average scores between 2012 and 2019, based on their combined results in English, maths and science in the Year 6 Cambridge Checkpoint tests. But neither school got the highest results in the most recent exams in 2019 \u2013 the distinction went to Harrington Sound PS in Smith\u2019s, which would remain open under the proposal. The Government\u2019s consultation plan \u2013 open for submissions from the public until March 12 \u2013 proposed closing nine primary schools, the renovation and expansion of nine others and the construction of a new primary school in Devonshire. The other seven schools facing the axe are Elliot and Prospect in Devonshire, the Gilbert Institute in Paget, Northlands in Pembroke, West End in Sandys and Heron Bay and Port Royal in Southampton. The plan would leave one primary school in each parish, apart from Pembroke, which would have two. Cambridge assessments to test proficiency in English, maths and science were introduced by the Progressive Labour Party government at the start of the last decade. Schools are rated as \u201cexcellent\u201d if they score between 5 and 6, \u201cvery good\u201d if between 4 and 5, \u201cgood\u201d if between 3 and 4, \u201cOK\u201d if between 2 and 3, \u201cpoor\u201d if between 1 and 2, and \u201cvery poor\u201d if between 0 and 1. The Royal Gazette took an average across all three subjects for the island\u2019s 18 primary schools, using results provided by the Ministry of Education, to create a 2012 to 2019 \u201cleague table\u201d. Nine schools are ranked as good, with St George\u2019s (3.9) and St David\u2019s (3.8) the clear leaders. All the other primary schools rated as good overall had a score above 3 but less than 3.1. St George\u2019s was first and St David\u2019s second for their scores in each subject, with both ranked as \u201cvery good\u201d in science. The Gilbert Institute was fifth and Port Royal eighth in the league table based on overall score. Both schools have been earmarked for closure. The other nine schools were ranked \u201cOK\u201d, with the top four schools set to close \u2013 Heron Bay (2.9), Northlands (2.8), Prospect (2.8) and West End (2.7). The 2012 to 2019 league table showed a general decline in exam results over the eight-year period, particularly in maths. Covid-19 halted Cambridge Checkpoint exams last year, so the most recent results are those from 2019, which are outlined in a separate table. Harrington Sound (3.1) was the only primary school on the island to be ranked as \u201cgood\u201d that year for its overall score. St George\u2019s (2.8) and St David\u2019s (2.0) dropped down to an \u201cOK\u201d rating for overall score. They appear in second and 12th place, respectively, in the 2019 league table. There were 11 other state primary schools which scored \u201cOK\u201d overall in 2019. It is proposed that, of those 11, Northlands (2.6), Prospect (2.4), Gilbert Institute (2.2), Port Royal (2.2), Elliot (2.1) and West End (2.0) should close. Four schools \u2013 Victor Scott (1.7), Francis Patton (1.6), Heron Bay (1.4) and Paget (1.3) \u2013 were ranked as \u201cpoor\u201d in 2019. All except Heron Bay would remain open under the proposal. No school got a score above \u201cOK\u201d in maths and the majority \u2013 11 out of 18 \u2013 were rated as \u201cpoor\u201d. Heron Bay and Paget got \u201cvery poor\u201d scores in maths. Only three schools \u2013 Harrington Sound, Northlands and Dalton E Tucker \u2013 got \u201cgood\u201d in English. Two schools \u2013 Harrington Sound and Purvis \u2013 were \u201cgood\u201d in science. The proposed plan for parish primary schools focused on a study of the condition of school buildings, open space and the potential for expansion, rather than academic achievement. The document said: \u201cIt would not have been a fair or responsible approach to select schools based on student performance, especially when we know that there is a preponderance of research to support that student achievement is impacted by so many factors that are outside of the control of the learner.\u201d Diallo Rabain, the Minister of Education, toldThe Royal Gazette in December that all state schools should be performing well. He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to have one or two schools doing great \u2013 all of them need to be great. \u201cWe need to look at how we are allocating our resources; how can we ensure that all are high performing.\u201d The proposal said pupils had \u201cnatural skills and abilities that reflect great potential\u201d but there was a \u201cdisconnect between our students\u2019 abilities and their levels of achievement and attainment\u201d. It added reshaping the primary system and having all ten schools accredited would mean \u201can improvement in student achievement, student attainment and the outcomes for education\u201d.

            "text": " ACCESSWIRE08 Mar 2021, 22:13 GMT+10  MONTREAL, QC / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2021 / MONARCH MINING CORPORATION ('Monarch' or the 'Corporation') (TSX:GBAR)(OTC PINK:GBARF) is pleased to announce it has increased the size of its McKenzie Break property by map-staking 36 new mining cells totalling 1,940 hectares (19.4 km2), extending the property southward. The wholly-owned McKenzie Break project is located 25 kilometres north of Val-d'Or, Qu\u00e9bec. 'We are very pleased to have put together a promising gold property of such significant size, in one of the most prolific mining camps,' said Jean-Marc Lacoste, President and Chief Executive Officer of Monarch. 'We are continuing to follow the mineralization southwards within the diorite unit on McKenzie Break with our 2021 14,500-metre drilling program, for which some results are already pending. These new claims will allow us to test the southern extension of the favourable geology in an area with relatively little past exploration.' Monarch acquired the original 386.6-hectare McKenzie Break property from Agnico Eagle Mines Limited in 2017 and expanded the property in 2020 through additional purchase agreements with local prospectors and map-based staking. The February 2021 staking expands the property to 169 claims covering 7,070 hectares (70.7 km2). Located 20 kilometres north of the Beacon mill and 10 kilometres south of the municipality of Barraute, Qu\u00e9bec, the property is accessible year-round via Route 397 and a gravel road and includes a portal and a 700-metre ramp driven in 2009. Figure 1: McKenzie Break property with expanded property limits. Geologically, the property straddles the Manneville Tectonic Zone, interpreted as the eastern extension of the Destor-Porcupine Break. Gold mineralization occurs in an elongated diorite unit or lens within a shallow embayment of the Pascalis Batholith. The recently staked claims cover a favourable gold-bearing diorite unit characterized by a magnetic high signature. The unit is geologically and geophysically similar to the area where Monarch has had recent drilling success leading to a recent resource update (Geologica and GoldMinds, February 2021) (see table 1).

(UDeCOTT) officially unveiled the Port of Spain National Academy of Performing Arts (North Campus) on the Princes Building Grounds, Queens Park East.\u00a0 The Academy, a significant part of the Government\u2019s broader Vision 2020 National Strategic Plan for reaching first world standards of development by the year 2020, is the first major effort specifically focused on the development of the cultural sector.\u00a0 Eye-catching architectural features and state-of-the-art facilities set this center for excellence apart from other structures of its kind in Trinidad and Tobago and the larger CARICOM region. The inaugural ceremony featured performances by the Eastern Youth Choral, the Shiv Shakti Dance Company and the Malick Folk Performing Company; as well as remarks by: The Academy, which will be the site for the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in late November, was constructed under the supervision of UDeCOTT, while Montreal-based Genivar Consultants served as the project managers.\u00a0 Additionally China-based Shanghai Construction Group served as the prime contractors.\u00a0 Almost 30 sub-contractors from Trinidad and Tobago contributed nearly TT$100 million worth of goods and services during the completion of the Academy. \u201cThe Academy was a remarkable team effort on the part of the developer, the project manager, prime contractor and the sub-contractors to complete construction on a condensed time schedule and on budget,\u201d said Minister of Planning, Housing and the Environment, Dr. Emily Dick-Forde.\u00a0 \u201cI am proud that Trinidad and Tobago will be able to showcase a global centre of excellence to visiting dignitaries and leaders during CHOGM.\u00a0 To me the Academy stands synonymous for many of our best qualities as a people, beautiful, full of life, rich in culture, but also determined, innovative and ambitious.\u201d Under the auspices of the University of Trinidad and Tobago, students of the performing arts will be able to develop their talents in a world-class learning environment, complete with practice facilities and state-of-the-art classrooms. To audiences and aficionados of the performing arts, a modern 1200 plus seat auditorium provides an engaging venue to showcase the best local and international artists and performers. \u201cThe Academy is a true architectural achievement, inspired by our national flower, the Chaconia,\u201d said Calder Hart, Executive Chairman of UDeCOTT. \u201cFrom a design perspective I believe we have done the artistic process that lies at the heart of this academy justice and we have added a gem to the physical landscape of the city. There are very few facilities of this quality and beauty in the world, much less in the region. UDeCOTT is proud to be executing the Government\u2019s vision brick by brick.\u201d The Port of Spain National Academy for the Performing Arts (North Campus) is one of two such facilities built as part of a Government-to-Government, two per cent concessional loan from the People\u2019s Republic of China to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The second facility, The National Academy of the Performing Arts (South Campus) will be located in San Fernando, is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2010. Both facilities are performance and teaching academies and will feature a vast array of open vistas for the enjoyment of the performance arts as well as contemporary classrooms, teaching halls and other practice spaces for the cultivation of the performance artists. Vision 2020 is to ensure that by the year 2020, Trinidad and Tobago will be a united, resilient, productive, innovative and prosperous nation with a disciplined, caring, fun-loving society, comprising healthy, happy and well-educated people and built on the enduring attributes of self-reliance, respect, equity and integrity. UDeCOTT is developing the structures that form part of Vision 2020, the national strategic development plan of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. UDeCOTT has over 60 projects, under construction and is launching future construction to include: The Port of Port of Spain expansion, the Development of Invaders Bay and the Urban Development Project. UDeCOTT and its leadership remain committed to improving the quality of life for the people of Trinidad and Tobago, the implementation of the government\u2019s Vision 2020 plan and the development of the country as a regional and global leader.

            "text": " Those affected appear to host Web versions of Microsoft's email programme\u00a0Outlook on their own machines The White House on Sunday urged computer network operators to take further steps to gauge whether their systems were targeted amid a hack of Microsoft's Outlook email programme, saying a recent software patch still left serious vulnerabilities. \"This is an active threat still developing and we urge network operators to take it very seriously,\" a White House official said, adding that top US\u00a0security officials were working to decide what next steps to take following the breach. CNN on Sunday separately reported the Biden administration was forming a task force to address the hack. The White House official, in a statement, said the administration was making \"a whole of government response.\" While Microsoft released a patch last week to shore up flaws in its email software, the remedy still leaves open a so-called back door that can allow access to compromised servers and perpetuating further attacks by others. \"We can't stress enough that patching and mitigation is not remediation if the servers have already been compromised, and it is essential that any organisation with a vulnerable server take measures to determine if they were already targeted,\" the White House official said. Already, a source told Reuters more than 20,000 US\u00a0organisations had been compromised by the hack, which Microsoft has blamed on China, although Beijing denies any role. The back channels for remote access can impact credit unions, town governments, and small business, and have left US\u00a0officials scrambling to reach victims, with the FBI on Sunday urging them to contact the law enforcement agency. Those affected appear to host Web versions of Microsoft's email programme\u00a0Outlook on their own machines instead of cloud providers, possibly sparing many major companies and federal government agencies, records from the investigation suggest. A Microsoft representative on Sunday said it was working with the government and others to help guide customers, and the company urged impacted clients to apply software updates as soon as possible. Neither the company nor the White House has specified the scale of the hack. Microsoft initially said it was limited, but the White House last week expressed concern about the potential for \"a large number of victims.\" So far, only a small percentage of infected networks have been compromised through the back door, the source previously told Reuters, but more attacks are expected. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021 Are Amazonbasics TVs Good Enough to Beat Mi TVs in India?

To date, the BNU has received three A400Ms into Melsbroek. The BAC\u2019s 15th Air Transport Wing now operates two Belgian and one Luxembourg A400Ms for the BNU, with four more Belgian aircraft to be delivered. (Belgian Air Component) Aircraft CT-03 arrived at Melsbroek, the military area of Brussels airport, on 4 March. The Belgian Air Component (BAC) will operate a total of seven A400Ms, including one purchased by Luxembourg.  The BAC\u2019s 15th Air Transport Wing will field the fleet under the auspices of the joint Belgian-Luxembourg Bi-National Unit (BNU). These aircraft will be made available to the European Air Transport Command and through that the European Rapid Reaction Force. As previously reported by Janes, the remaining six A400Ms will be delivered to the BAC by 2023, with full operating capability for the BNU slated for the end of 2024. Besides receiving seven aircraft of its own, Belgium is also an industrial contributor to the A400M programme, responsible for manufacturing detailed machined wing elements and flight-control surfaces. Set to replace the BAC\u2019s ageing Lockheed Martin C-130H Hercules, the A400M can carry strategic payloads over strategic distances, while being able to deliver them in a tactical fashion to where they are needed. Figures released by Airbus DS show that with a 20-tonne payload, the A400M can fly an unrefuelled 3,400 n miles at 37,000 ft and at near-airliner speeds of Mach 0.72.  \nAlready a Janes subscriber?

Saying goodbye to loved ones and holding burial services and funerals are parts of a mourning process. However, many governments worldwide placed strict restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic over attending such occasions in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. Alami lost his father to a heart attack, yet it was impossible to give him a funeral or a condolences gathering since people are not allowed to meet in groups amid continuous increase in COVID-19 cases in Lebanon. Fadi Shams, owner of Ezzat Company which provides funeral services, told Xinhua that the people attending funerals and burial services dropped by 90 percent after COVID-19. \"Even if the deceased did not die from the coronavirus, you would only find a maximum of five people attending the funeral at the church,\" he said. Shams noted that prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, families of the deceased used to be picky in choosing the coffins and flowers to be placed in churches during funerals, but things have changed for now. \"Today, people ask for the cheapest coffins as funerals have become restricted to close family members, not to forget the dire economic conditions in the country,\" Shams said. Kamal Harb, who owns a company offering funeral services, told Xinhua that people used to serve visitors sandwiches during funerals and hire waiters to serve food in honor of the deceased. \"Funerals used to cost at least 1,300 U.S. dollars, however, the biggest funeral now only costs about 1.3 million Lebanese pounds (130 U.S. dollars),\" Harb said. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Lebanon, families of the deceased made death announcements on social media platforms by placing their phone numbers on scanned funeral papers for people who wish to offer their condolences. \"It's very sad to see our loved ones leaving this world while we are not able to feel the support of our close friends except virtually,\" Lama Obegi, who lost her older brother in a car accident two months ago, told Xinhua. \"The COVID-19 epidemic has changed one of our most important and valuable traditions,\" she added.

            "text": " Kano \u2014 The Managing Director of Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM Bank), Mr. Abba Bello, has disclosed that Nigeria has a huge solid minerals endowment with over 34 solid minerals available in commercial quantities. He noted that since he took over the helms of affairs in NEXIM, he has developed targeted products to unlock opportunities in the sector, including the Contract Financing Scheme and the Equipment Leasing framework. The Managing Director, adding that over the next few years, the solid minerals sector would increasingly realise the benefits of NEXIM's intervention. Bello, spoke in Kano, recently, during a working visit to the Dutse Granite Company Limited, which is Nigeria's indigenous operator in the solid minerals sector that has commenced operations. He added that the objective of the bank was to ensure creation of jobs and to support forex earnings for the country. He said that in spite of this, the sector accounts for less than one per cent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and contributes less than one per cent of non-oil exports revenue. Bello mentioned that part of challenges of the solid minerals sector was poor access to finance, given the capital-intensive nature of mining projects and the need for long term funds. The Dutse Granite Company is based in Sharada Industrial Area, Kano, which produces granite tiles and slabs for import substitution and export. The company, which was incorporated in 2011, was first financed by NEXIM in 2015, but somehow encountered some challenges.

According to the Managing Director of the Bank, this led to disbursement of more money in 2018 and 2019, to enable the company acquire state of the art processing machinery and equipment. Also speaking, the chief promoter of the company, Alhaji Mustapha Khabeeb, disclosed that but for the intervention of NEXIM bank, the project, with machinery currently worth over N1 billion would have been stalled. He disclosed that the company has about the best machinery for granite processing in the country presently, saying that the products were comparable in quality with those imported from Europe. Khabeeb, indicated that his company currently has 37 staff in direct employment, \"but this does not include many others in the value chain from the quarry to the distribution network, and other by-products, which run into hundreds.\" The company supplies the major construction companies in the county and has export orders from Saudi Arabia, Chad and Ghana. He, however, disclosed that logistics challenges were major impediments to maximising the export potentials of the company. Read the original article on This Day.

            "text": " Alex Enumah in Abuja The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN), has reiterated Nigeria\u2019s commitment towards ending gender-based violence in the country. Malami reiterated government\u2019s position in a speech he delivered to commemorate the 2021 International Women\u2019s Day (IWD). According to the AGF, the federal government is focusing \u201csignificant attention on the issue of sexual and gender-based violence and therefore working towards the establishment of specialized courts and Judicial Divisions focused on sexual and gender-based violence\u201d. Speaking on the theme, \u201cSpecial Event on Gender Dimensions of Criminal Justice Responses to Terrorism\u201d organized by the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC), the minister recalled that he inaugurated the Inter-Ministerial Management Committee on Eradication of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence last year with the hope that they will be important tools in helping Nigeria to address the crime. According to a statement by his media aide, Dr Umar Gwandu, the AGF disclosed that the Complex Case Group under his office leads in the efforts to bring suspected terrorists to justice and also work to include sexual violence-related charges against Boko Haram suspects in collaboration with the military, police and other security service investigators from the multi-agency Joint Investigation Centre in North-east Nigeria. He said the current administration also know well that giving a voice to women is an important aspect of development as women are important agents of positive change. Malami, however, noted with dismay that terrorist groups continue to kidnap and commit sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, noting that preventing these crimes and bringing those who commit these acts to justice remains a priority of the government of President Muhammadu Buhari. \u201cAnother emerging area of grave concern is the abduction and kidnapping of teenagers in boarding houses for ransom. The perpetrators targeted this group of people possibly to scare them from schooling. This is indeed a sad situation. \u201cThe Nigerian armed forces and law enforcement agencies are working day and night to combat insecurity, terrorism, kidnapping and abduction of people in the country. \u201cWe must work to prevent both male and female perpetrators from carrying out these acts and support those who have been victims,\u201d he said. The minister added that in partnership with UNODC as well as the European Union, the federal government launched the \u201cNigeria Training Module on Gender Dimensions in the Criminal Justice: Response to Terrorism\u201d. According to him, the module provides practical guidance based on Nigeria\u2019s legal framework as well as international and African regional laws and good practices to support Nigerian officials in addressing the issues of gender in the counter-terrorism context. He said that the Nigerian National Action Plan for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism notes the important role women play not only as policy-makers and law enforcement officers, but also wives and mothers in preventing violent extremism and in de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. \u201cNigeria also has developed a National Action Plan on the Implementation of Security Council Resolution 1325 on the Women, Peace and Security agenda which he said was relevant to efforts to respond to the needs and promote the role of women in efforts to address terrorism,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Malami has condoled with the families of late Justice of the Supreme Court, Sylvester Nwali Ngwuta. In a condolence message, Malami said the death of the eminent jurist created huge vacuum to the Nigerian Justice sector and in particular the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Malami described the deceased as a great man who rendered selfless service that contributed immensely in nation building, with particular reference to judiciary and justice sector. He said the late Supreme Court Justice has contributed to the development of the legal profession, adding that the nation\u2019s history will never forget him.

Known for its citrus and dairy farming, the Gamtoos River Valley is buckling under a years-long drought, bringing farmers to their knees.  Due to the dwindling reserves, the 132 agricultural water users who rely on the dam for irrigation have been able to draw just 20% of their annual water quota since last July. The Kouga Dam is currently at 6.55%, and the Gamtoos Irrigation Board (GIB) has warned water users that it cannot supply water adequately below the 3% water mark.  \u201cKouga Dam has been consistently dropping since it was at just above 50% in September 2018,\u201d the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality said.  The municipality had no programmes of assistance it could point to for farmers affected by the drought conditions.  GIB chief executive Rienette Colesky said: \u201cThis situation endangers the citrus harvest for many farmers who might not be able to water their crops further and who do not have access to alternative sources, such as boreholes.  \u2019\u2019The situation was already dire for our cash crop and dairy farmers from the start of the water year, as a 20% availability of their full water allocations has had a devastating effect on the planting of cash crops and the watering of pastures for dairy farming.\u201d Cattle and citrus farmer in the valley, Tertius Meyer, said some farmers had already used up their water allocations for the 2020/21 water year, which ends in June, leading to their supply from the dam being discontinued. \u201cSome farmers are helping their neighbours. Some are spending a fortune bringing in water in tankers just to keep their orchards alive. One can see the condition of the cattle worsening, as there is very little food for them, forcing farmers to either sell off their livestock or rent grazing in areas with water and move their herds. \u201cAs you drive through the valley, you can see the trees are dry. The fruit size will be affected, which means there will be an abundance of smaller fruit this season.\u201d A fellow farmer in the valley, Khaya Katoo, said he had had to drill boreholes to supplement his water supply from the dam. \u201cOur quota will be used up very soon, but we have fruit which needs harvesting. That\u2019s a worry, as it\u2019s hot and the trees need a lot of water.\u201d Port Elizabeth Weather Office spokesperson Garth Sampson said the highest incidence of rain over the dam\u2019s catchment area occurred from March to October.

            "text": " Here are some simple tips to get you started on making good money in the stock market! Image source: Getty Images Some new investors don\u2019t know where to start. They might have heard that stock investing provides the greatest long-term returns, which will get you to your financial goals faster. However, they don\u2019t know what to start investing in. Moreover, they might be concerned about the volatility that comes with every stock. In other words, they\u2019re afraid to lose money. Here are some tips to help you get started. The basic idea about stock investing is that you get returns from dividends and price appreciation. Dividends are paid out from a company\u2019s earnings or cash flow. Price appreciation comes naturally to a stock when a company becomes more profitable over time by generating greater earnings or cash flow. For example, the market correction has brought Fortis (TSX:FTS)(NYSE:FTS) stock down to a good valuation for purchase. An upside of about 17% is possible over the next 12 months, according to the analyst consensus. Fortis is a good stock for new investors to consider, because of its defensive and low-volatility nature. Importantly, you get stable returns from the regulated utility through its trustworthy dividends. Fortis pays a dividend every three months. At $50.21 per share at writing, it yields 4%. Management anticipates growing its dividend at a healthy pace of about 6% per year through 2025. This should result in long-term returns of about 10% per year based on its reasonable valuation today. About 4% of the returns will come from the dividends and 6% from price appreciation from the growth of the underlying utility. A 10% rate of return would allow investors to double their investment in about 7.2 years, according to the rule of 72. Market sell-offs can lead to greater stock price appreciation in the long run. Even for an above-average defensive and low volatility stock like Fortis, it still fell approximately 30% from peak to trough in the pandemic market crash. Most investors would have missed the low in a flash and see the stock falling only about 23%. Besides, the stock rebounded from the $40s to the $50s level within three weeks from the low. By buying at a low of about $44 in Fortis during the 2020 market correction, investors would be sitting in price gains of 14%. The price appreciation would be even more prominent on higher-growth stocks. For example, Open Text stock has appreciated about 27% from its 2020 market crash low of about $45. This suggests that investors should embrace market volatility and buy quality stocks when they are on sale. So, only buy stocks that you\u2019re comfortable adding to at lower prices. Investors new to stock investing just need to get started. Don\u2019t be afraid to start small to learn the ropes before investing a bigger percentage of your investment portfolio in stocks. Remember to work market pullbacks and corrections to your advantage by aiming to buy quality stocks instead of selling out of panic. Long-term investors of quality companies like Fortis and Open Text have made good money while earning nice income along the way. Right now, both stocks are trading at good valuations, which means they should make good money for patient investors buying at current levels.

China's state industry supervisor SASAC, which announced the agreement in a statement on Wednesday, did not give details of the expansion plan for the Chinese-owned mine. The mine began operation in 2013 and produced 31,407 tonnes of copper and 5,500 tonnes of zinc in the first quarter of this year, but has also faced problems concerning environmental contamination and strikes by workers demanding higher wages. China's President Xi Jinping signed a series of other cooperation agreements with Peru during his visit last week.   (Reporting by Muyu Xu and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Susan Fenton)     More...

            "text": " PRINCE Harry claimed he had to make deals with Netflix and Spotify after revealing to Oprah he had been cut off by the Royal Family following Megxit. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they had \"no plan\" after quitting the Royal Family - and hadn't considered the megabucks deals until a friend suggested it. \ud83d\udc51\u00a0Read our\u00a0Meghan and Harry live blog\u00a0for the latest news... And he said it was when he was told his security would be taken away that he realised he needed to quickly find a source of income for his family. Speaking to Oprah about the streaming deal, the 36-year-old said: \"We didn't have a plan.  \"That was suggested by somebody else by the point of where my family literally cut me off financially, and I had to afford security for us.\" Prince Harry said his own father Prince Charles had stopped taking his calls for a time and that he had been cut off at the start of 2020. It comes as... He said:\u00a0\"I've got what my mum left me, and without that, we would not have been able to do this.\" Since quitting the Royal Family, Meghan and Harry have signed two massive deals - one with Netflix rumoured to be worth \u00a3100m and another with Spotify believed to be worth about \u00a330m. Harry said: \"The biggest concern was that while we were in Canada, in someone else's house, and then I got told short notice that security was going to be removed. \"So suddenly it dawned on me, hang on a second, the borders could be closed, we're going to have our security removed, who knows how long lockdown is going to be. \"The world knows where we are. It's not safe. It's not secure.\" Prince Harry explained: \"During Covid, the suggestion by a friend was, 'What about streamers?'.\" Meghan then added: \"We genuinely hadn't thought about it before.\" Harry said: \"So, there were all sorts of different options. And look, from my perspective, all I needed was enough money to be able to pay for security to keep my family safe.\" The couple said they had thankfully been put up by Tyler Perry at his LA mansion while they figured out their next steps - later moving to Santa Barbara to raise their son Archie. During the explosive two-hour interview, Meghan said she had written to the Royal Family begging for Harry's security to continue to be funded after seeing death threats. And Harry said he had been shocked by the decision to remove funding for his security, saying he had \"inherited\" the risk after being born into the Royal Family. He said: \"I never thought I would have my security removed, because I was born in to this position.\" And he admitted he would not have quit the Firm without Meghan's help saying: \"I wouldn't have been able to because I myself was trapped as well.\" Harry added: \"I didn't see a way out. I was trapped within the system, just like the rest of my family are. \"My father and my brother - they are trapped. They don't get to leave and I have huge compassion for that.\" And he said he believed his mother Princess Diana would have been \"angry\" with how the situation panned out. He said: \"Ultimately, all she would ever want is for us to be happy.\"  Wilder FINALLY congratulates Fury on epic trilogy win with classy post  Georgina \u2018speechless\u2019 after Ronaldo buys her \u00a3105k Louis Vuitton jewellery trunk  David Amess murder investigation being led by counter terror police  Man stuns ex by paying off her ENTIRE mortgage to thank her for being a good mum \u00a9News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

The contract could include two additional projects totaling 284 MW. Responses are due August 30. Pacific Hydro bought the 39.3-MW Coya hydropower plant in 2004 from government-owned copper miner Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile (Codelco). At the same time, it secured exclusive water rights in the Alto Cachapoal Basin sufficient to develop another 400 MW. In 2006 it awarded a contract to Poyry Energy for engineering services to upgrade and expand Coya to 103 MW. (HNN 11/14/06) Pacific Hydro Chile S.A. invites pre-qualification of design-build firms for Chacayes (also spelled Chicayes) upstream of Coya on the Pangal River. Work is to include final design, civil works, and supply and installation of water-to-wire equipment. Pacific Hydro said it would provide up to 40 percent equity in the project. Prospective bidders are to enter into preliminary arrangements with one or more equipment suppliers from the following list: Andritz VA Tech Hydro, Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation, GE/IMPSA, Alstom, Litostroj, Toshiba, or Hitachi. The project is to include intake structures, desanding bays, canal, head pond, power tunnel, and two turbine-generators totaling 106 MW. Contract could include 98-MW Nido de Aguila, 186-MW Las Lenas An optimization study of the Cachapoal recommended three other projects, 98-MW Nido de Aguila on the Cortaderal River, 186-MW Las Lenas on the Alto Cachapoal and Las Lenas rivers, and 78-MW Maravillas on the Cortaderal. Although the invitation for pre-qualification is focused on the Chacayes project, Pacific Hydro said a key selection criterion is whether the design-build firm can take on the construction of Chacayes, Nido de Aguila, and Las Lenas simultaneously. Pacific Hydro said that would deliver economies of scale and commonality of equipment benefits. Expected investment for the three plants is more than US$600 million. An optional briefing session and site visit to Chacayes is scheduled June 21. Bid documents may be obtained upon request to the address below. Applications for pre-qualification are due August 30. Invitations to bid are to be sent to pre-qualified firms September 30, with bids due January 15, 2008.

            "text": " March 26, 2007 \u2014 -- China has used the Cricket World Cup in the West Indies to try and hit archrival Taiwan out of the stadium. Beijing is widely seen as having financed the building or improvement of many cricket venues being used for the World Cup to isolate Taiwan and expand its influence in the Caribbean. China has spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years. The International Cricket Council's 10-year budget to promote cricket globally: only $70 million. China gave Antigua a $55 million grant to build the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium. It gave $30 million to Jamaica for a new Trelawny stadium. St. Lucia has both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of Beijing. The 70,000 people of Dominica have received the aid equivalent of $1,600 per person in the form of a cricket grounds, new drains for the capital and better roads. The immediate reason for this largesse is Beijing's determination to diplomatically isolate Taiwan. Says Harry Sung of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Washington, D.C.: \"Their top priority is to isolate Taiwan. Most of the remaining countries that recognize Taiwan are located in the Caribbean and Latin America.\" China's cricket diplomacy led to two West Indian countries, Grenada and Dominica, derecognizing Taiwan as an independent country. Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket. Grenada had one stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. China ran in and erected a second one. Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan. A worried Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It gave $21 million to the tiny island of St. Kitts and Nevis and $12 million to even smaller St. Vincent for cricket grounds. Taiwanese officials have even sought to comprehend the game, called shen shi yun dong or \"the noble game\" in Chinese. The media officer of the Taiwanese Embassy in St. Kitts guardedly said, \"We have watched the game. We understand it a little.\" Pramit Pal Chaudhuri is a Bernard Schwartz Fellow at the Asia Society. Beijing sent 1,000 Chinese workers to finish the stadiums in time. Without the Chinese workers, said a grateful Antiguan Prime Minister Winston Balder Spencer at his stadium hand-over ceremony, \"we wouldn't have been able to complete the stadium.\" Chinese Ambassador Ren Xiaoping replied, \"Their sweat has soaked this land.\" Beijing's inroads in the Caribbean reflect the country's rising economic and political influence, as Taiwanese officials admit. China has carefully flavored adoption of its \"one-China policy\" with economic carrots for the Caribbean islands. For example, islands that remain loyal to Taiwan are not approved as a travel destination by Beijing for its citizens -- at a time when the Chinese are one of the world's fastest-growing group of globetrotters. Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door. Senior Chinese ministers in recent visits to the region have outlined a five-point agenda that includes \"greater consultations\" with the purpose of \"safeguarding common interests.\" David Jessop of the U.K.-based Caribbean Council has argued that Beijing seems to be trying to forge a new alliance with developing countries. Says Sung, \"This is not surprising. Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy.\" One view is that China, concerned at increasing international criticism about its human rights and trade policies, is seeking a \"Sino bloc\" of friendly votes at the United Nations and other multilateral fora. U.N.-based diplomats note that China has been focusing increasingly on small countries in the Pacific, Africa and the Caribbean, which are susceptible to aid and other incentives. Says Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, \"The Chinese take the U.N. very seriously.\" China has other plans regarding cricket: Beijing has set a target of having a Chinese national team qualify for the 2019 World Cup. The Chinese Cricket Association, an affiliate of the International Cricket Council, already has cricket academies in place and is on track to have 20,000 players and 2,000 coaches by 2015. Cricket is virtually unknown in Taiwan. Taiwanese diplomats in St. Kitts are apologetic, \"We only play baseball in Taiwan.\" Pramit Pal Chaudhuri is a Bernard Schwartz Fellow at the Asia Society.

And there was one person who played an unexpected supporting role in the story: Tyler Perry. Markle shared with Winfrey that the media mogul offered Markle, her husband Prince Harry and their infant son Archie his home and a full security detail when they first moved to America. While Perry is known for his generosity, this news is especially shocking considering the Royal Family rescinded the child's security despite the fact that the couple were under a significant threat level. Twitter was abuzz about Perry's generosity, and the Royal Family's callousness: The Queen rescinded security for Harry and Meghan, despite the threat level to both of them, so Harry decided they had to leave Canada because the lockdown was imminent. So they went to the US and Tyler Perry offered them a safe house and security. Wow.#OprahMeghanHarry TYLER PERRY OFFERED THEM HIS HOME AND SECURITY!!! Tyler Perry always has his purse open ready to serve others! #OprahMeghanHarry All the rich white people Harry knows & it\u2019s Tyler Perry that helped #OprahMeghanHarry Tyler Perry offering Prince Harry and Meghan refuge from the monarch just became my favorite Tyler Perry fun fact lmao Tyler Perry is the unlikely hero of the evening.Meghan is THE hero of the evening.

            "text": "  Wanted man shot dead in St Andrew 9:03 pm With shovels, from left, China Harbour Country Manager Dangran Bi; Housing Agency of Jamaica Chairman Norman Brown; Prime\nMinister Andrew Holness; and Mayor Norman Scott officially break ground for the Catherine Estates development. State Minister Alando\nTerrelonge (standing left); and MPs Andrew Wheatly (centre) and Fitz Jackson look on.  THE Housing Agency of Jamaica (HAJ) on Wednesday officially broke ground for the 1,650-unit Catherine Estate housing project, to be developed in St Catherine, as a joint venture partnership with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), a company known for building roads and bridges.\n Prime Minister Andrew Holness was special guest of the agency at the ground-breaking activities for the integrated, sustainable community development which is targeting low-income families, first-time homeowners and public sector workers. The project is estimated to cost $9.5 billion. \n Holness said the Government is committed to ensuring that every Jamaican has the opportunity to own their own home, and that the National Housing Trust (NHT) will be providing 100 per cent financing for the houses. \n \u201cWe are refocusing efforts to get the economy back on track and securing jobs that have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, so that you can be part of this great development,\u201d he stated. \n Catherine Estates will have 850 duplex studio units with an average size of 273 square feet, and 800 detached one-bedroom starter homes at 367 square feet. \n Each housing unit will be configured for easy upward and outward expansion, and the projected selling prices are $5.5 million for studios and $6.6 million for one-bedroom units\u2013 subject to market conditions. \n HAJ Chairman Norman Brown said the project is a perfect representation of the agency's mission to ensure that Jamaicans from all walks of life have access to high-quality housing. \n \u201cThe creation of formal housing developments and homeownership, in general, carry so many social and economic benefits to the homeowners, their families, the communities and Jamaica, by extension. Therefore, with each new housing development, we get one step closer to realising our collective goals as a country,\u201d he told the gathering. \n Spanning a total of 253 acres of land, in the vicinity of March Pen Road and Quarry Hill, the development is being recognised as one of the largest affordable housing solutions to be built in St Catherine, since the development of Greater Portmore in 1992. \n Gary Howell, HAJ managing director, pointed out the need for the public to disregard suggestions that Catherine Estate is just another housing development, \n \u201cIt is so much more than that. This project is creating well-planned, sustainable, and holistic houses for many of the people who would ordinarily not be able to afford their own homes. As a result of our collaboration with CHEC, we will ensure that 1,650 regular working-class Jamaican individuals and families will become proud homeowners, and that is something we should all celebrate,\u201d he said. \n CHEC Jamaica's Country Manager Dangran Bi pointed out that decent and affordable housing is very important, if the country is aiming at building families. \n \u201cWe are making that promise to build homes and create a community where Jamaicans will be proud to raise their families. We see all over the world how decent and affordable shelter is woven into better opportunities for children and their parents, and we are very happy to be working with the Government of Jamaica and the Housing Agency of Jamaica to provide this for almost 2000 families,\u201d he said. \n Catherine Estate will be developed in six phases, with 14 clusters. Each of which will be served by essential community amenities, such as side walks, grocery stores, recreational spaces and walking distance access to public transportation. \n The development will also reserve land for the development of a primary school, secondary school, church, police station, health centre, and commercial facility. \n Also attending the event were minister of state in the Ministry of Education, Youth and Information, Alando Terrelonge; St Catherine Members of Parliament Fitz Jackson and Andrew Wheatley; and the Mayor of Spanish Town Norman Scott.  \n POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES  \n\n      Now you can read the Jamaica Observer ePaper anytime, anywhere.

The card will launch this spring over a network of one million businesses, and will also facilitate donations to women-owned nonprofits that are part of the Women's Economic Future Fund. Cardholders will be able to access the Seneca Women community, including events, a marketplace, and programs on the Seneca Women Podcast. The companies plan to issue a similar card for small businesses later this year. \"It was less than 50 years ago that women could be turned down for a credit card based solely on their gender. And today, women continue to face inequities,\" said Sharon Bowen, a partner at Seneca Women, in a release.  Long-time technology executive and antivirus software developer John McAfee faces U.S. Department of Justice fraud and money laundering charges for allegedly promoting cryptocurrency firms without saying he was being paid for the work. Jimmy Watson, an advisor to McAfee, was also indicted, reports Coindesk, citing a DOJ press release. The pair reportedly made more than $13 million in the scheme, and the Commodity Futures Trading commission is also charging McAfee and Watson, seeking civil penalties. McAfee in October 2020 was arrested in connection to a separate case for alleged tax evasion tied to promoting Initial Coin Offerings. Venture capital firm A16z Crypto led a group of investors in a $26 million round in cryptocurrency platform Eco, a positive signal for mainstream cryptocurrency payments. Eco's app, which recently came out of beta, offers incentives to consumers for using crypto at Amazon Uber and other merchants. Eco plans to use the new funding to add bill pay and P2P transfers, reports TechCrunch. Other VC participants in the round include Founders Fund, Activant Capital and Coinbase Ventures. Crypto has traditionally been viewed as an investment asset, though more mainstream attention over the past year from brands like Tesla, Square, PayPal and Mastercard has increased interest in using crypto for merchant payments. Nepal bank NIC Asia has partnered with Hong Kong-based digital banking company Wallyt to offer digital payments to the bank's merchants via WeChat Pay and UnionPay QR. The service allows merchants to offer same-currency transactions to people from China who visit Nepal. Chinese travelers are the second-largest source of tourism in Nepal, according to a release. While that corridor is largely shut off, the companies are positioning for greater volume as pandemic restrictions ease. Like businesses globally, hotels in Nepal have been quickly adding digital payment applications during the pandemic, Wallyt said in its release.

Foto: Galo Paguay / El Comercio Cinco frentes de trabajo del Proyecto hidroel\u00e9ctrico Quijos lucen abandonados. Ni siquiera hay guardias para controlar el ingreso de alg\u00fan visitante a la obra. Cualquier persona puede llegar a las obras de toma del r\u00edo Papallacta, en la poblaci\u00f3n de Cuyuja (a dos horas de Quito, en la v\u00eda que llega a Baeza) y contemplar los dos canales de concreto de unos 50 metros de largo y 5 m de profundidad, que est\u00e1n inconclusos. Por ah\u00ed circula parcialmente el agua del r\u00edo. Una cintas amarillas con letras negras de \u201cpeligro\u201d -que en alg\u00fan momento sirvieron de advertencia a los trabajadores para que no cayeran a los canales- est\u00e1n rotas y se enredan en el suelo con cables sueltos que dotaban de energ\u00eda a las maquinarias. Este Diario visit\u00f3 el  martes pasado (19 de enero) el lugar. En la parte alta de los canales de concreto, unas 10 varillas de acero sobresalen y est\u00e1n oxidadas. El Proyecto Hidroel\u00e9ctrico Quijos, que demandar\u00e1 de USD 138 millones, fue adjudicado a la firma China National Electric Engineering Company (Cneec), la cual comenz\u00f3  la construcci\u00f3n en enero del 2012.  Este proyecto aprovecha los caudales de los r\u00edos Quijos y Papallacta, mediante dos t\u00faneles de unos 3 kil\u00f3metros.  El agua de ambos r\u00edos se une en una \u2018Y\u2019 subterr\u00e1nea, para trasladarse por un t\u00fanel principal de 3,5 kil\u00f3metros. Al final, aprovecha una ca\u00edda de 136 metros para mover tres turbinas con una potencia total de 50 megavatios (MW). Pero a pesar de ser una  central  relativamente peque\u00f1a, por su potencia y dimensi\u00f3n,  en tres a\u00f1os solo avanz\u00f3 46%.  Los constantes incumplimientos de normas t\u00e9cnicas, de calidad y de ingenier\u00eda en la ejecuci\u00f3n de la obra llev\u00f3 a que la Corporaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador (Celec) de por terminado el contrato  de manera unilateral con la firma Cneec, el 10 de diciembre del 2015, explica el jefe de la Obra Civil de este proyecto hidroel\u00e9ctrico, Manuel Andrade, tambi\u00e9n funcionario de la Celec. La utilizaci\u00f3n de m\u00e9todos descontinuados de excavaci\u00f3n, la falta de una maquinaria de perforaci\u00f3n tipo jumbo ofrecida por la contratista, el escaso personal y la poca experiencia han dado como resultado que Cneec haya perforado solo 4 600 metros en la obra, de los 10 000 que ya deb\u00eda tener en diciembre, cuando sali\u00f3, explica Andrade.  \u201cAvanzaban de 60 a 70 metros semanales. Con ese rendimiento se habr\u00eda demorado dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s en terminar la central\u201d, dijo el funcionario, quien a\u00f1ade que la contratista ya dej\u00f3 de trabajar en varios frentes, incluso en junio del 2015, seis meses antes de que sea declarada incumplida. Esto sucedi\u00f3 porque no quisieron firmar un contrato complementario, pues el primer plazo de la obra se venci\u00f3 en marzo del a\u00f1o pasado. \u201cNos dijeron que pod\u00edan continuar con las obras exteriores y que les ayudemos a conseguir un subcontratista que haga las obras subterr\u00e1neas. Pero ya no quisieron continuar, no se sintieron capaces\u201d, dijo Andrade. El funcionario argumenta que est\u00e1n en proceso de cobro USD 25 millones, por garant\u00edas a la compa\u00f1\u00eda china.\u00a0\u201cNo hay nada de avance en el proyecto. Est\u00e1 parado. (\u2026) Cualquiera puede meterse.  Hasta la guardian\u00eda quitaron. Est\u00e1n varios frentes abandonados\u201d. La Celec est\u00e1 en proceso de volver a poner cuidadores, lo cual todav\u00eda no sucede. De hecho, este Diario pudo acceder al t\u00fanel de Ventana 1, que luce inundado y funciona como bodega para guardar maquinaria, acero para cerchas, bater\u00edas, agua con combustible y chatarra.  Tampoco hay vigilancia ni personal en los t\u00faneles de las ventanas 3, 4 y 5. El campamento de la Ventana 2 est\u00e1 abandonado, sin cerraduras en las puertas de madera. En el frente Casa de M\u00e1quinas, seis personas de la empresa china cuidan unas cinco volquetas y otras maquinarias que reciben mantenimiento. Ha sonado el nombre de la firma china Sinohydro  para hacerse cargo del proyecto, pero a\u00fan no se ha concretado el traspaso, comenta Andrade. El gerente del proyecto Quijos de Cneec, Tan Faming,  desde sus oficinas en Baeza, dijo a este Diario que la empresa china dar\u00e1 una entrevista la pr\u00f3xima semana, para contar su versi\u00f3n sobre su salida esta obra y de la central Mazar-Dudas, donde tambi\u00e9n fue declarada incumplida.

Su solera se encuentra en  la cota 953,00 msnm.\nLa chimenea inferior adem\u00e1s de asegurar la sumergencia de las turbinas Francis proveer\u00e1 del agua necesaria para evitar que se produzcan presiones negativas en el sistema casa de m\u00e1quinas \u2013 descarga en el caso de cierre de las turbinas.    Para construir una presa en hormig\u00f3n de esta categor\u00eda, el primer paso es limpiar la tierra y vegetaci\u00f3n de los dos estribos extremos, luego raspar todo hasta llegar a roca firme. Seg\u00fan el tipo de roca e inclinaci\u00f3n de la misma se hacen bermas o terrazas para proceder a fundir el hormig\u00f3n, con este proceso se obtiene una buena adherencia a la misma roca, posteriormente se har\u00e1n inyecciones de consolidaciones para m\u00e1s cohesi\u00f3n entre la roca natural y el hormig\u00f3n artificial. Todas las presas de hormig\u00f3n se construyen en bloques principales separados, la Presa del Toachi tiene 9 bloques verticales desde un estribo al otro, todo estar\u00e1 estructuralmente firme para poder soportar la presi\u00f3n del embalse. Pantalla de hormig\u00f3n a gravedad de 60,00 m de altura, asentada sobre el lecho del r\u00edo Toachi a la cota 914,00 msnm en el eje; tiene una longitud de 157,00 m y anchos de 12,00 m y 22,00 m en su corona a la cota 973,00 msnm. Sus paramentos aguas arriba y aguas abajo son inclinados con pendientes V:H = 1 : 0,3 y 1 : 0,7 respectivamente. Constituida por 9 bloques atravesados por una galer\u00eda de 3.50 m de ancho x 5,60 m de alto que interconecta el t\u00fanel de descarga Sarapullo con el t\u00fanel de presi\u00f3n Toachi - Alluriqu\u00edn. Produce un embalse de una capacidad de 8\u2019500.000 m3 para un volumen de regulaci\u00f3n diaria de 2\u2019000.000 de m3 con niveles m\u00e1ximo y m\u00ednimo de operaci\u00f3n de 970,00 y 965,00 msnm respectivamente. El aporte anual de sedimentos al embalse se estima en 0,86 millones de m3. El bloque 5, adem\u00e1s de contener el vertedero indicado en el p\u00e1rrafo anterior, aloja a la casa de m\u00e1quinas de la mini central de 1,4 MW ubicada al pie de la presa, alimentada con el caudal ecol\u00f3gico del r\u00edo Toachi de 4,14 m3/s, con una turbina tipo Francis de eje vertical, aprovechando la altura bruta de 41 m que provee el embalse. Son dos vertederos cuyo punto m\u00e1s alto est\u00e1 en la cota 962,50 m, ubicados individualmente en los bloques 3 y 4 y controlados por compuertas radiales de 14,00 m de ancho x 7,50 m de alto accionadas por servomotores. Las compuertas controlan el nivel m\u00e1ximo de operaci\u00f3n del embalse y si est\u00e1n totalmente abiertas ser\u00e1n parte del perfil de los vertederos y permitir\u00e1n descargar el caudal de crecidas de 1.000 m3/s para un per\u00edodo de recurrencia de mil a\u00f1os. La descarga de los vertederos se efect\u00faa por medio de saltos de esqu\u00ed que tienen su labio en la cota 942,25 msnm; al final se han dispuesto de deflectores que permitir\u00e1n airear los chorros y lograr una mejor disipaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda en el aire antes de caer al estanque dispuesto aguas abajo de la presa. La Presa cuenta con dos desfogues ubicados en los bloques 3 y 4, ubicados debajo de los vertederos de excesos en la misma vertical. Para el control del desfogue se cuenta con compuertas radiales de 8,00 m de ancho x 8,00 m de alto accionadas por servomotores. La cresta de los desag\u00fces se encuentra a la cota 927,00 msnm. Los dos desag\u00fces de fondo tendr\u00e1n capacidad para descargar hasta 500 m3/s, libres de sumersi\u00f3n, en el estanque de disipaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda aguas abajo de la presa. Se inicia en la cota 952 msnm al final de galer\u00eda de interconexi\u00f3n y transportan las aguas provenientes del embalse formado por la Presa Toachi m\u00e1s las aguas descargadas de la central Sarapullo hasta la central Alluriqu\u00edn, a trav\u00e9s de un t\u00fanel de 8,75 km de longitud hasta el inicio del blindaje de acero de la tuber\u00eda de presi\u00f3n, en la cota 779,50 msnm, con una secci\u00f3n libre circular de 5,60 m de di\u00e1metro con un recubrimiento de 0,30 m de hormig\u00f3n con acero de refuerzo, para transportar un caudal m\u00e1ximo de 100 m3/s. Las aguas de los r\u00edos Pilat\u00f3n y Toachi llegan a casa de m\u00e1quinas Alluriqu\u00edn dentro de una tuber\u00eda de presi\u00f3n de acero con una longitud desarrollada aproximada de 306,00 m, un espesor mayor a 15 mm, di\u00e1metro interno de 4,70 m y recubierta de hormig\u00f3n de 0,60 m de espesor. La tuber\u00eda de presi\u00f3n se divide en tres ramales de un di\u00e1metro interno de 2,70 m hasta empatar con la v\u00e1lvula mariposa dentro de casa de m\u00e1quinas. La cota de llegada de los ramales distribuidores est\u00e1 en la 732,00 coincidiendo con el eje de las turbinas. La funci\u00f3n de la chimenea de equilibrio superior a m\u00e1s de regular las presiones del agua conducida a casa de m\u00e1quinas sirve tambi\u00e9n para amortiguar las fuertes presiones provocadas por el golpe de ariete en caso de una interrupci\u00f3n s\u00fabita de las turbinas, transformando la energ\u00eda cin\u00e9tica en energ\u00eda potencial con un aumento de la altura de agua en la chimenea en las maniobras de cierre y viceversa en las maniobras de apertura. La chimenea de equilibrio superior est\u00e1 conectada lateralmente a 38,5 m del inicio de la tuber\u00eda de presi\u00f3n, conformada en su parte inferior por el pozo de conexi\u00f3n de 3,50 m de di\u00e1metro interior y una altura de 126,00 m hasta la cota 905,00; y sobre \u00e9ste el pozo de la chimenea con un di\u00e1metro interno de 15,00 y una altura de 90,00 m hasta alcanzar la cota 995,00; terminando en su parte superior con una boca de 24,00 m de di\u00e1metro y 10,00 m de altura hasta la cota 1005,00. Estructura de hormig\u00f3n con varios niveles construida dentro de una excavaci\u00f3n subterr\u00e1nea a unos 350,00 metros de la margen izquierda del r\u00edo Toachi a unos 4 kil\u00f3metros aguas debajo de la confluencia del ri\u00f3 Pilat\u00f3n.Sus principales caracter\u00edsticas son: \u2022 Excavaci\u00f3n de 66,40 m de largo x 26,30 m de ancho x 45,08 m de alto.3 turbinas tipo Francis con una potencia nominal de 68 MW y una velocidad de rotaci\u00f3n de 360 rpm, un caudal de dise\u00f1o de 33,33 m3/s cada una. El eje de las turbinas est\u00e1 en la cota 732,00 msnm y la contra carga est\u00e1 dada por la cota 736,00 msnm que corresponde a la restituci\u00f3n de las aguas al r\u00edo.\u2022 3 generadores con una capacidad 80 MVA cada una, un factor de potencia 0,85, un voltaje de generaci\u00f3n 13,8 kV a una frecuencia de 60 Hz.\u2022 3 transformadores.\u2022 3 v\u00e1lvulas de guardia tipo mariposa de 2,40 m de di\u00e1metro.\u2022 Puente gr\u00faa con una capacidad de 250 t/20 t, y una luz de 16,00 m. Paralelo a la casa de m\u00e1quinas, a unos 32,00 m aguas abajo, se encuentra la chimenea de equilibrio inferior constituida por una caverna de 42,30 m de largo, 11,00 m de ancho y 37,60 m de altura; la cota de la solera est\u00e1 en los 722,00 msnm.

            "text": " Home / Top Featured Article / How I navigated unemployment during COVID I am no stranger to bouts of unemployment. When I first graduated from university and returned to Barbados, I\u2019d spent about seven months watching copious amounts of MSNBC and eating cereal on my parents\u2019 couch. It had been frustrating, primarily because I wasn\u2019t sure what kind of work I\u2019d be suited for with degrees in English and International Relations (and apparently neither was corporate Barbados). I couldn\u2019t tell you the number of applications I\u2019d sent in, but it was definitely upwards of 50. The copywriting position I\u2019d been working at before COVID got it (which sounds like a bad movie by the way) was actually the only interview I\u2019d gotten after all those months and now, through no fault of my own, I was back to square one. I\u2019d love to say that my previous experience with unemployment prepared me for this one, but I\u2019d be lying. If anything, I was more anxious because the difficulty of finding a job in the first place was still fresh on my mind. I\u2019ll pause here to say that my situation was in no way as dire as many others, nor would I want to portray it as such. I live at home with supportive and understanding parents, with only a few manageable bills to my name which offers quite a bit of relief when you\u2019re, as they euphemistically say, \u2018between jobs\u2019. But it was still a difficult time, both mentally and emotionally. Apart from my other colleagues, I personally didn\u2019t know anyone else who\u2019d been laid off and in fact, it seemed as though many of my peers were moving forward in their careers. Like many other twenty-something-year-olds, I wanted to step into the next phase of my life, which is hard as is given the state of the job market in Barbados, but the pandemic only made it worse. Now, almost a year later, I\u2019ve transitioned from un-, to self-employed. I\u2019d previously done some freelance writing but have since committed to it full-time as the job market isn\u2019t exactly booming and likely won\u2019t be for a while. Surprisingly, the new normal of remote work has opened a lot of doors that I wouldn\u2019t have imagined, and I\u2019m truly grateful for the opportunities. This unexpected path has brought a number of teachable moments. However, my biggest takeaway would be that while stress is inevitable, it is very counter-productive. I still struggle with this quite a bit because I\u2019m generally an anxious person and have been made more so by the pandemic. I\u2019m also the \u2018planning type\u2019 and freelancing doesn\u2019t allow for the kind of structure that I\u2019m most comfortable with. However, I\u2019ve recognised that the days I spend worrying and stressed about my workflow or income (or future in general), are also the days I get nothing done\u2014surprise, surprise. This means that for an entire day, I\u2019ve, in fact, done nothing to improve the aforementioned workflow or income that I\u2019ve been stressing about, resulting in more stress. It\u2019s a vicious, unhelpful cycle.\u00a0 Those days I feel especially overwhelmed, I try to give myself ten minutes to panic or lean into the stress I might be feeling. Then I try to force myself to focus on something within my control. This can range from a Netflix binge to checking off a minor item on my to-do list. I don\u2019t overthink what it is that I choose to focus on, so long as whatever it is, isn\u2019t coming from a place of anxiety. In the spirit of transparency, it doesn\u2019t always work, but nevertheless, I still try.\u00a0 This article appears in the March 1 edition of COVID Weekly.

            "text": " After a long overnight trip, a truck laden with Spanish onions arrives at Berlin's wholesale market. During unloading, disaster strikes - three pallets are dropped, seriously damaging the carefully selected onions. The trader phones Rien Veraart in the Netherlands. Can he haul some of these damaged onions away for the industry? A few hours later, the shipment, initially thought to be lost, is delivered to a Polish onion peeling company. Rien Veraart This is just one example of how Rien's day sometimes goes. And how quickly he needs to respond to a situation. Rien is a Dutch farmer. He grows mainly table potatoes. But also small batches of parsnips, celeriac, blackcurrants, and grass seed. Rien grows most of the latter products for industrial processing, which is also where his specialization lies. Veraart likes experimenting on his farm. \"Last year, for the first time in a long time, I planted a field of onions. They don't usually do well in this part of the country. That's because of the pickling onions that used to be cultivated here. Plants from which a rubber alternative can be extracted were also grown here,\" says Rien from his year-old office at Veraart Agri.  Farming eventually led to fruit and vegetable trading. \"Initially, we often supplied vegetables such as parsnips and celeriac directly for industrial processing. Those plants, however, run 52 weeks a year. And growers usually don't have products available for that same amount of time. We, after all, work with natural products,\" explains Rien. \"At a certain point, I was asked if I could get a load of carrots for processing. That's how I ended up in the free market trade - buying and selling batches. It's a sideline to the fruit and vegetable processing sector. It's also not something that will suddenly disappear from the market.\" In the 90s, Rien found himself in the Czechian market. \"That started in 1995. We bought a cultivation company there for growing vegetables for industrial processing. Later, in 1999, I opened a trading office in the Czech town of Podivin. That lies between Brno and the Slovak capital, Bratislava. Business is good there at the moment. We buy vegetables from local growers and sell them to the drying, cutting, freezing, and canning industries. In recent years, our range has increased from three to 15 different types of vegetables.\"  \"These include parsnips, carrots, turnips, cabbages, beetroots, etc. They're sent all over Europe. We could buy a load of cabbage in Slovakia and find a buyer for it in France or vice versa. In hindsight, we were right to focus on this market so soon after the fall of the Wall,\" continues the farmer/trader. \"We're centrally located in a region where industrial vegetables still have an important share of the market. That share is even growing slightly. After the West Flanders processing industry, the Polish canning industry is the largest in Europe.\" Is this expansive assortment thanks to the increasing local vegetable cultivation in Eastern European countries? \"Central European,\" corrects Rien. \"We still refer to countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia as the former Eastern Bloc countries. But people sometimes forget these countries' rich histories from before the world wars. The Czech Republic, for example, was, for a long time, one of the most industrialized regions of Europe. That was within the Habsburg Empire. And Prague houses one of the oldest European universities.\" Harvesting of onions Rien considers trading as a nice supplementary income. \"I like being among people and love to travel. So I enjoy going somewhere to trade fresh produce. I don't just work on my farm, which I also like to do. However, now with COVID-19, it's been a while since I traveled to the Czech Republic. I usually visit there a lot during the year. I often manage to squeeze in a day trip to one of the nearby towns.\" \"That traveling has now come to a halt. But, fortunately, trade hasn't suffered. People still need to eat. There seems to be plenty of room for additional trade on the European market. Vegetable production and demand on the markets in Europe are also on the rise. So, I'm even looking for an additional employee on site. Someone who understands trade and has a command of Polish, German, and English.\" Farm in Oud Vossemeer Besides the social aspect, Veraart also makes good money trading. \"I make nice annual margins, and the work is different every day. One day they need cucumbers in Poland, which I can get at a good price in Westland, the Netherlands. The next day it's something like bell peppers, green beans, or carrots. Growers' profits have shrunk considerably in recent years too. Potatoes and celeriac, for example, are currently selling at below cost price. So, as a farmer, I have to do something to supplement that,\" Rien concludes.

In November 2020, National Director of Public Prosecutions Adv Shamila Batohi - with the support of Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola - requested the President to institute an inquiry into Adv Noko's fitness to hold office and to suspend Adv Noko pending the outcome of the inquiry. Having considered this request, the President agreed that an inquiry be held. In a communication dated 9 February 2021 and channelled through the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, the President requested Adv Noko to provide written reasons why she should not be suspended pending the institution and finalisation of an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. As a matter of courtesy, on 11 February 2021, the National Prosecuting Authority, as the employer, informed Adv Noko that she should expect to receive the letter from the President. On 14 February 2021, Adv Noko requested permission to vacate her office. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) forwarded Adv Noko's request to resign, via the Minister and with his support, to the President with the recommendation that Adv Noko be allowed to vacate her position.

The National Director's request to the President in November 2020, to institute an inquiry into Adv Noko's fitness to hold office, followed the publication of what has become known as the De Kock Report. This report was compiled by an expert panel in the context of the NDPP's review of the authorisations of Advocates Jiba and Abrahams to institute a racketeering prosecution, in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, against General Johan Booysen, former head of the KwaZulu-Natal Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation (the Hawks), and other police officials. Concerns arose with regard to the conduct of certain NPA officials, including Adv Noko. The National Director evaluated the findings made in the De Kock report, as well as certain High Court judgments. Legal opinion was also sought from private counsel who, after evaluation, advised that the matter be referred to the President to consider instituting an inquiry. The National Director subsequently recommended to the President that an inquiry be held into the fitness of Adv Noko to hold the office of Director of Public Prosecutions.

            "text": " The Government of Chile has declared a massive investment plan for 20 billion US Dollars (17.7 billion Euros) to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure. Inter alia, it includes the modernisation or construction of several railways to provide better commuter service, especially in the Santiago capital area. The South American state also intends to construct its first high-speed railway that will connect Santiago and Valparaiso. President of Chile Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era has declared that a new investment plan will be a great stimulus for the development of the country\u2019s economy. He noted that several rail projects should be financed and implemented. Among them are the construction of four new lines (7, 8, 9 and 10) of Santiago Metro, the extension of four existing ones (2, 3, 4 and 6) and the construction of the rail link between Santiago International Airport and the city centre. The rail renovative projects include the development the intercity routes from Santiago to Valparaiso and Melipilla as well as the extension of Valparaiso Metro to the city of La Calera. The Santiago \u2013 Valparaiso is supposed to be the first high-speed rail in Chile with a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour. The line will have a branch to San Antonio for freight service. This project is estimated at 2.4 billion US Dollars (2.1 billion Euros). The price includes the supply of 12 trains to serve the route. Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications estimates that the construction works will start in 2020 and will be completed in four-five years. Currently, there are two probable candidates to construct the line: the TVS consortium (China Railway Group, the Chilean companies of Sigdo Koppers and Latinoam\u00e9rica Infraestructura) and the second group of FCC, Agusa and Talgo. The Chilean rail sector has survived a deep crisis in the 1970s and 1980s during the rule of Augusto Pinochet. Most of the passenger routes were closed and the rail infrastructure has been maintaining badly. The revival of the rail industry in Chile began in the 1990s. The country\u2019s national railway company Ferrocarriles del Estado (EFE) started to restore some passenger links. Currently, Chile has a patchwork of several commuter lines instead of one network. The main commuter services are provided in the Santiago Metropolitan Region and Valparaiso Region. TerraSur, the only intercity train in Chile, runs between Santiago and Chill\u00e1n.

Plant Type Hydroelectric Location Napo province, Ecuador Capacity 1,500MW Estimated Investment $2.6bn \n                      Expand\n                      \n Plant Type Hydroelectric Location Napo province, Ecuador Capacity 1,500MW Estimated Investment $2.6bn Start of operation November 2016 Owner Cocasinclair EP Key Players Cocasinclair EP, Sinohydro, Harbin and Andritz Hydro \n                      Collapse\n                      \n The Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric facility is the largest energy project in Ecuador\u2019s history. Located in the Amazon Basin, 100km east of Ecuador\u2019s capital Quito between the provinces of Napo and Sucumb\u00edos, the 1,500MW project is a run-of-river development on the Coca River. The plant\u2019s eight turbines will produce 8.8 billion kWh per annum, supplying 35% of the country\u2019s overall electricity consumption and saving about two billion litres of imported diesel for thermal power plants per year. Backed by strong political will, the project was promoted as a centrepiece of the new energy plan in Ecuador, which aims to replace thermoelectric energy from fossil fuels with renewable hydroelectric energy, and the import of energy from Peru and Colombia with self-sufficient energy production from renewable sources. The developer and owner of the project is Cocasinclair EP (Coca Codo Sinclair EP), a state-owned special-purpose enterprise established in 2010. The construction of the $2.6bn project started in 2010 and was completed by November 2016, creating 8,000 jobs. It will also reduce CO\u2082 emissions by 4.5 million tonnes a year. A tunnel collapse at the plant construction site killed 13 people and injured 12 in December 2014. It also caused partial damage to the high-pressure pipes inside the engine room. The Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric project was proposed in the early 1980s but could not be implemented because of the Reventador volcanic eruption in 1987 and financial constraints. In 2007, Ecuador President Rafael Correa restarted the project and Italian company Electroconsult was contracted for a new feasibility study. In February 2008, Coca Codo Sinclair SA was established as a joint venture company between Ecuador\u2019s state-owned power company Termopichincha, 70%, and Energia Argentina (Enarsa), 30%. Ecuador then bought the entire stake of Enarsa for $5.5m in September 2009. State-owned company Cocasinclair EP was later established for the development of the project. Coca Codo was financed through debt, 63%, and equity, 37%. The Export-Import Bank of China granted a $1.68bn loan payable in 15 years, with the remaining funds provided by the Ecuador Government. The access road to the powerhouse was completed in October 2012. A stretch of a heavy crude oil pipeline, intersecting the project site, was already relocated. Initial engineering works included the construction of the water intake area, powerhouse and tunnelling. The project is being developed in an area where the Coca River flows in a great curve at a natural slope of 620m. The water intake complex is located on the Coca River, 1km downstream of the confluence of the Quijos and Salado rivers. It comprises a concrete face rockfill dam built on the existing river channel, a concrete spillway built on the left bank of the river, and the sedimentation basin and intake built between the dam and spillway. Any water diverted from the intake passes via the 120m-long sedimentation basin to run through a 24.8km-long concrete-lined headrace tunnel, with an excavation diameter of 9.1m, into the compensating reservoir, which has a usable volume 800,000m\u00b3. Water from the compensating reservoir is fed through two 1,900m-long penstocks to the eight Pelton turbines installed in the underground powerhouse, which measure 26m x 50m x 192m. A parallel cavern of 16.5m x 33m x 192m houses 24 single-phase transformers of 68.3 MVA each and a 500kV substation. The access path to the powerhouse is 495m long, 6.5m wide and 7.5m high. A tailrace tunnel delivers water back to the Coca River. The hydroelectric project is designed to use a 620m-high natural waterfall with a maximum regulated flow of water of 278m\u00b3/s. Coca Codo\u2019s run-of-river intake has a maximum capacity of 7,500m\u00b3/s. The sedimentation basin has six bays and a design sediment particles size of 0.25mm, while the maximum derived flow in the headrace tunnel is 222m\u00b3/s. Two penstocks with vertical shaft and horizontal reach feed the water from the compensating reservoir to the eight generating units of the plant. In addition, the power plant is equipped with eight six-nozzle vertical Pelton turbines, each with a rated output of 187.7MW. Each turbine is powered by a runner with 22 buckets with a width of 835mm. The bid documents for the Coca Codo Sinclair project were developed by Hogan & Hartson, a law firm based in Washington DC, US. Sinohydro-Andes JV won the engineering, construction and procurement (EPC) contract for in October 2009. It is a consortium of Chinese company Sinohydro, 89%, Ecuadorian company Coandes, 8%, and consulting companies Yellow River and Geodato with 3%. A 66-month $72.4m management and inspection contract was awarded in April 2011 to a Mexican-Ecuadorian consortium, consisting of Mexico\u2019s state-owned power company Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), three engineering consultancies and Ecuador\u2019s Consultora Vera y Asociados and Ingenieros Consultores Asociados. Chinese company Harbin with Andritz Hydro was awarded the contract to supply the electromechanical equipment, as well as eight Pelton runners, one spare runner and 48 nozzles. The company also provided the hydraulic concept and the model test. Nexans was contracted to supply extra-high-voltage power cables to connect the project to the local power network in May 2013. Sinohydro contracted Sedicon in April 2014 to provide sediment removal equipment for the desanders. The contract included 40 SediCon Sluicer units that remove more than 5.44 million tonnes of sediments a year. Marti Norge supplied a 26.9m conveyor system, while Holcim supplied cement. The Coca Codo Sinclair plant is connected to the National Interconnected System (NIS) of Ecuador, which distributes energy throughout the country. The power generated from the plant is delivered to the national grid through two 500kV transmission lines, one of which runs from Cocasinclair substation to the El Inga substation, which is connected to the NIS. The project will reportedly affect approximately 2,000 people. The major controversies are that it will render the San Rafael Falls, the tallest waterfall of Ecuador, dry and that the road constructions to the project site have led to deforestation in the UNESCO Sumaco Biosphere Reserve. \t\t   Diesel engine and gas turbine power plants must deliver energy...\t\t    \t\t   As part of the TTS Energy Services portfolio that includes...\t\t    Hornsea Project One is an offshore wind farm located off the Yorkshire coast, UK, within the Hornsea Zone in the\u2026 GNA I is an integrated liquefied natural gas (LNG)-to-power project located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

            "text": "  NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP/GETTY This article is adapted from\u00a0AQ\u2019s\u00a0latest issue\u00a0on China and Latin America | This piece has been updated While the U.S. and allies distance themselves from Chinese tech companies such as Huawei, China has become Latin America\u2019s top investor of its booming technological sector. Tencent invested $180 million in Latin America\u2019s top unicorn company, Brazilian fintech firm Nubank. Large Chinese companies have acquired local startups, such as Didi Chuxing purchasing Brazil\u2019s 99 Taxis and initiatives such as Chinnovation, which pairs up Latin American and Chinese tech investors, signal this trend will only increase. Even Baidu\u2019s discontinued $60 million fund for Brazilian startups last year, left the country saying they intended to continue to invest but directly from their home front. Chinese investment in regional companies has been accompanied by deep penetration of its own firms. Telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE have largely integrated into the region. Noticias \u00c1guila, Mexico\u2019s most downloaded news app, was created by a Shenzhen-based company. Huawei is one of the top contenders to build a fiber-optic cable connecting Chile to Asia, is already building one connecting Sinaloa to Baja California Sur in Mexico for $14 million, and like Alibaba will be competing with Amazon by setting up data centers in Chile. Possible risks Where Chinese companies go, allegations of espionage, hacking, and unscrupulous business practices usually follow. In Poland, a senior Huawei employee was arrested in January for allegedly spying on the Polish government. In the UK, the British government found evidence that the company\u2019s telecommunication equipment could be compromised. Despite the risk, Huawei is the contractor of choice to build digital infrastructure like 4G mobile networks across a broad swathe of Latin America. The complex nature of telecommunications means changing suppliers is easier said than done once a company builds your mobile network. This over-reliance means that Huawei can afford to drag its feet in addressing the security concerns of governments. Indeed, after the UK raised issues with the security of the equipment, the company said it would take five years to address the country\u2019s concerns. Furthermore, companies such as ZTE have exported surveillance technology to Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela. While these systems are geared towards natural incidents and cutting crime, they can lead to breaches of citizens\u2019 private information, increased censorship and new tools for authoritarians. In Venezuela, ZTE is helping the Maduro\u2019s government build a national identification system that can help the embattled government crackdown on dissent. The Cybersecurity Gap In case these risks come to fruit, Latin American countries may not have as strong capabilities to defend themselves unless they continue to develop their own infrastructure. A lack of cybersecurity infrastructure has led to an unfortunate amount of increased risks. In 2017, Latin America suffered from 677 million cyberattacks, a 59% increase from the previous year that cost the region $97 billion. There are some initiatives to address this gap. Chile is executing its first national cybersecurity strategy to be completed by 2022 and created a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). Mexico started to improve its financial sector cybersecurity after losing $15 million over the course of two months in 2018 to hackers exploiting third-party vulnerabilities. And the number of credit scoring, identity, and fraud management companies in the region increased by 571% from 2017 to 2018. Solutions Strengthening and implementing intellectual property and cyber governance laws will boost innovation. Weak cyberinfrastructure both decreases the ability for countries to defend their businesses and national interests and limits technological development in the region. Implementing strong cyber laws that are also adaptable to quick technological change, as well as creating national and regional cybersecurity frameworks, as well as China strategies, would be key. Finally, more support should be given to existing tech startups. Only 32% of Latin American fintech startups have a presence abroad and their average number of employees is only 15. Currently, Latin America has several great incubators\u2013even some that have been running for over two decades, such as Colombia\u2019s CREAME. Technological parks, however, are still few and far in between. Overall, Chinese tech companies and investment can present a strong opportunity for Latin American countries\u2013if they don\u2019t open themselves up to the risks.

When exemplars are purposefully integrated into teaching they have the potential to cultivate knowledge and skills that develop this ability. As the voices of educators have been largely silent in exemplar-focused studies, the current study sought to canvas educators\u2019 views about why and how they use exemplars. This paper draws on data from 44 educators who responded to prompts in a Likert-scale survey and 14 educators who completed individual interviews. Findings identified three explicit and one implicit reason for using exemplars, with educators using these tools in ways that facilitate realization of each purpose. Educators appeared to hold an implicit expectation that as a consequence of working with exemplars, students would inevitably apply insights gained to their own work. Further, educators did not make any explicit reference to using exemplars to develop student self-monitoring or self-regulation. We concluded the full potential of exemplars can only be realized when educators acknowledge self-regulation as the overarching rationale informing use, and use exemplars alongside works-in-progress with the intention of facilitating the transfer of evaluative and productive knowledge and skills to current and future tasks. \n        Hawe, E., \n        Dixon, H., \n            & \n        Hamilton, R.\n    (2021).\n    Why and how educators use exemplars.\n    Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice, 18(3).\n        https://ro.uow.edu.au/jutlp/vol18/iss3/010\n 119 DOWNLOADS Since March 07, 2021 \nPlum Print visual indicator of research metricsPlumX MetricsUsageAbstract Views: 132Downloads: 119CapturesReaders: 1Social MediaTweets: 2see details\n \nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nAddThis\n \n\n\t\t\tAdvanced Search\n\t\t\n \nHome | \n        About | \n        FAQ | \n        My Account | \n        Accessibility Statement\n \nPrivacy\nCopyright\n"

Developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, the new single-shot vaccine helps to prevent Covid-19 in people aged 18 years and above. The authorisation was based on data obtained from the Phase III ENSEMBLE clinical study which demonstrated that the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe Covid-19. It also showed protection against hospitalisation and death related to the disease, starting 28 days after vaccination. Under the terms of the IO authorisation, the single-shot vaccine can be used in the country while more data are gathered. Janssen Canada Medical Affairs vice-president Ebele Ola said: \u201cA vaccine that prevents severe disease and protects against Covid-related hospitalisation and death will help ease the burden on Canadians and the strain on our healthcare systems. \u201cOur single-shot Covid-19 vaccine is a critical tool for fighting this global pandemic.\u201d Brii Biosciences files application for  EUA for BRII-196/BRII-198 therapy in US The company noted that the single-dose vaccine, which leverages the company\u2019s AdVac vaccine platform, is compatible with standard vaccine storage. It is estimated to stay stable for two years at a temperature of -20\u00b0C. For a maximum of three months, the vaccine can be stored in refrigerators at temperatures of 2 to 8\u00b0C. Additionally, Janssen is planning to file for a Notice of Compliance with Health Canada later this year.

A long-term win-win contract between China and Bolivia was under preparation since early 2019 and being negotiated as a 51% Bolivia \u2013 49% China share-arrangement, with manufacturing of batteries and other lithium-related products foreseen in Bolivia \u2013 added value, job creation in Bolivia \u2013 with an initial investment of US$ 2.3 billion \u2013 was about to be signed, when the US-instigated Bolivian military coup occurred. It was immediately followed with the usual US-style intimidating, violent and murderous oppression, particularly directed at protests by indigenous people. They \u2013 the indigenous people, 70% to 80% of the Bolivian people \u2013 didn\u2019t want to lose their President, Evo Morales, who has improved their lives enormously, like nobody else before since Bolivia\u2019s independence from Spain some 200 years ago. Evo has drastically reduced poverty and provided most Bolivians with jobs and with a decent living. President Evo Morales had to seek asylum in Mexico to protect himself and his family from threats to his life and that of his loved ones, as well as to his political associates and members of Congress, who were in line to succeed him. The CIA, its handlers and their paid assets work with impunity, without scruples. After the long-prepared and US- orchestrated \u2018civic-military\u2019 coup on 10th November, Bolivia is being ruled by a self-appointed, illegal, temporary (they say), neofascist government which is not only supported by the United States \u2013 the \u201cputsch-maker\u201d \u2013 but also by the abysmally shameful European Union, as well as by the Organization of American States \u2013 OAS (boasting, the US pays 60% of OAS\u2019 budget\u2026). Bolivians have been plunged into a violent military-police dictatorship knowing no restraint beating up indigenous protesters and shooting them with live ammunition. At least 25 have already been killed and hundreds wounded. A\u00f1ez has signed a decree exonerating police and military from criminal prosecution for crimes and murders committed on protesters,giving the police and military a direct license to kill. Evo Morales, was forced to resign by top military brass which has been secretly trained by the School of the Americas, now called The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).Evo has been bitterly betrayed by Washington-corrupted and trained officers. About 20 of Evo\u2019s closest entourage, including members of congress, who according to the Bolivian Constitution would have been in line to take up temporarily the Presidency until new elections are organized \u2013 a fact Evo proposed before being forced to resign, hardly reported by the western media \u2013 were also ordered to resign. They were all granted asylum in Mexico. They were told by the new, illegal self-appointed Government, that they were not allowed to run for the Presidency in upcoming elections. This is the type of \u201cDemocracy\u201d exported by Washington. Its more aptly called dictatorship. The power and fervor of pro-Morales protests in Bolivia is increasing day-by-day. Evo was the first indigenous President of the plurinational Andean country. Indigenous Bolivians, the vast majority, are strong supporters of Evo\u2019s and his MAS party (MAS = Movimiento al Socialismo, or movement towards socialism). Having a socialist Government was certainly a reason for the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, but not the only one, perhaps not even the key reason. Bolivia, like Venezuela, is rich in natural resources, gas, oil, minerals and metals \u2013 and lithium, a light metal, used in car batteries, especially batteries for electric cars. They are ideal assets to be privatized by a neoliberal government for the benefit of a few local oligarchs and of foreign corporations \u2013 mostly US, of course. Stealing natural resources from developing countries is a key objective for the empire\u2019s attempting to establish monetary and territorial world hegemony. Already before Evo Morales first took office in January 2006, he pledged to the Bolivian people that the vast and rich natural resources treasures of Bolivia belong to Bolivia, to the Bolivian people. Among the first actions of his Presidency was the partial nationalization of the hydrocarbon industry \u2013 gas and petrol. Evo inherited from his predecessors, Goni Sanchez and Carlos Mesa an absurd arrangement, whereby the foreign corporations would receive on average 82% of the profits from hydrocarbon exploitation and the remaining 18% would stay in Bolivia. It is precisely for this reason that both Goni and Mesa were thrown out by the people in bloody people\u2019s rebellions in 2003 and 2005, respectively. When Evo was elected President in 2005 and took office in January 2006, he reversed this proportion: 82% for Bolivia and 18% for the transnationals. The western world screamed and hollered and warned him that all the foreign investors will abandon Bolivia \u2013 and Bolivia will be alone and her economy will collapse miserably. None of this happened, of course. Because even under this new arrangement foreign corporations made enough profit for them to stay in Bolivia. They are there as of this day. In comes lithium, a soft, light and highly flammable mineral \u2013 what some call the gold of the 21st Century. The world\u2019s total known lithium reserves are about 15 million tons, with a potential of up to 65 million tons. Bolivia has arguably the world\u2019s largest single known lithium deposits with a projected 9 million tons, about 60% of all known reserves. Bolivia\u2019s lithium has so far remined largely untapped, whereas major current producers are Chile, Argentina, Australia and China. Bolivia\u2019s reserves are located in the Uyuni salt flats, the world\u2019s largest salt desert (some 10,000 km2) in the remote southern tip of Bolivia, about 4,000m above sea level. Lithium is contained in salt brine pools below the Uyuni salt flats. Access is complicated because of altitude and remoteness and lithium mining has also environmental issues. Finally, and maybe most importantly, Evo Morales has promised his people that this valuable resource will not just be exported as raw material, but processed in Bolivia so that added value and major benefits remain in Bolivia. The general manager of state-owned Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) assures that \u201cBolivia will be a relevant actor in the global lithium market within four or five years.\u201d Lithium is mainly used for the production of car batteries, cell phones, electronic devices in sophisticated weapons systems. In the age of growing environmental consciousness and electric cars, the car battery market is expected to explode in the coming years. China\u2019s President, Xi Jinping, recently said that as of 2030, all new cars on China\u2019s roads will be electric. Though, this may be optimistic, it speaks for a huge market. It is expected that the use of lithium in car batteries alone could triple \u2013 or beyond \u2013 in the coming 5 to 10 years. In the last few weeks, the Bolivian Government was about to sign a contract with ACI Systems Alemania (ACISA), a small German mining company. On November 4, the deal was canceled, due to local protests over profit sharing. The local population wanted an increase of royalty payments from 3% to 11%. The deal would have brought a US$ 1.3 billion investment in the Salar del Uyuni (the Uyuni Salt Flats) over time for a vehicle battery factory and a lithium hydroxide plant. Similar deals with Tesla and other US and Canadian battery producers also failed, because of unacceptable profit-sharing arrangements. China has the World\u2019s largest lithium market. By far. And the one with the fastest growth potential. With a million Chinese electric cars sold in 2018 alone, demand is expected to increase almost exponentially. President Xi\u2019s predictions may be slightly optimistic, but according to a Chinese thinktank, by 2040 all new vehicles on China\u2019s roads will be electric. Already today, almost 100% of all scooters roaming major cities are electric. In February 2019, the Chinese company Xinjiang TBEA Group Co Ltd. And the Bolivian state company Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) negotiated a deal that would have given Bolivia 51% and the Chinese 49% shares of a lithium extraction investment, an initial US$ 2.3 billion investment venture, expandable according to market demand. The project would have included manufacturing of vehicle batteries \u2013 and more \u2013 thus, adding value in Bolivia and creating thousands of jobs. The Chinese Ambassador to Bolivia estimates that China would need some 800,000 tons of the light metal by 2025. Electric cars with today\u2019s technology require massive amounts of lithium, about 63 kilograms for a single 70 kWh Tesla Model S battery pack.Officially known reserves in the Salar Uyuni of some 9 million tons, correspond to about a quarter of total known world reserves, according the US Geological Survey. Countrywide lithium deposits in Bolivia, but not yet proven, may reach 21 million tons, mostly in the Uyuni salt flats, according to government projections. World Bank projections see global demand for lithium skyrocketing in the coming years, reaching more than 1,000% of present demand by 2050. A huge proportion of this multi-multibillion-dollar market would be Chinese. It is therefore not too far-fetched to believe that the US-induced military coup itself, and particularly its timing \u2013 has something to do with Bolivia\u2019s lithium \u2013 and more precisely with the China-Bolivia partnerhsip deal. Since the beginning of this year Bolivia has been negotiating with China, Bolivia\u2019s linking up to the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The lithium extraction and industrial development was part of it. Under Evo\u2019s guidance it could have lifted this still most impoverished country of South America out of poverty, to a level of \u201cliving well\u201d for most Bolivians. China, with her win-win approach for the BRI expansion around the globe and for such bilateral deals, as would have been lithium development in and with Bolivia \u2013 would have contributed greatly to the improvement of living conditions for this landlocked Andean country. With China being lambasted, thrashed and aggressed on every occasion, clearly, such a multiple billion-dollar long-term arrangement, for a market the west wants to claim for itself, is not allowed by the true axis of evil, the United States, the vassalic Europeans, Canada and Australia. So, President Evo Morales and his close MAS party allies \u2013 and potential successors \u2013 had to go. Unarmed indigenous people had to be intimidated by bought police and military forces. They are beaten up and shot at with live ammunition. As of today, the dead toll has reached at least 25, since the police-military violence began when Evo was forced to resign, about a week ago. It is predictable that the current \u201cinterim\u201d government will call a State of Emergency, meaning a de facto military-police dictatorship. The natural riches of a poor country that wants to use reserves for the betterment of her people, can be a curse \u2013 and especially if that country has a socialist regime.But \u2013 as a positive glare of hope, the Bolivian people are known to be headstrong and staunch defenders of their rights. So, with the support and solidarity of neighboring countries\u2019 people protesting for their lost civil rights, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina and maybe soon also Brazil, not all may be lost.

            "text": " ACCESSWIRE08 Mar 2021, 22:49 GMT+10 TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2021 / Avidian Gold Corp. ('Avidian' or the 'Company') (TSXV:AVG)(OTCQB:AVGDF) is pleased to provide assay results for the balance (seven holes) of its nine-hole 2020 oriented core drilling campaign at the Amanita property located 5 kilometres south and contiguous to Kinross Gold's (K) Fort Knox mine in the Fairbanks Mining District, Alaska (Figure 1). Gold mineralization was encountered in all holes, with the highlight being 24.21 m of 1.30 g/t Au in hole AM20-03. This intersection occurs approximately 60 m below surface, is comprised of oxide gold mineralization and includes a higher grade intersection of 5.77 m of 2.64 g/t Au. It appears to represent a second major mineralized trend parallel to the mineralization tested in AM20-02. Both zones trend to the northeast, remain open along strike and down dip. The mineralization tested in AM20-03 is located approximately 135 m east of the intersection in hole AM20-02 (see Figures 2 and 3) that encountered 27.22 m of 3.11 g/t Au which was drilled below the Trench D-West intersection of 27.0 m of 4.22 g/t Au (See press release of Dec 17, 2020). Higher up in hole AM20-02 an intersection of 6.10 m of 1.49 g/t Au appears to correspond to a shallow mineralized zone intersected 200 m to the south-south-west in hole AM20-07 of 1.40 m of 2.93 g/t Au. A 12 m thick biotite monzonite intrusive unit was encountered at the bottom of Hole AM20-07 approximately 150 m below surface. This intrusive unit is suggestive of a larger intrusive body nearby that could be the source of the gold mineralization encountered on the property. Hole AM20-08 encountered 2.93 m of 4.26 g/t Au approximately 10 m below surface, including 1.50 m of 8.07 g/t Au. This mineralization also appears to be trending northeast towards the top of hole AM20-05 that intersected 1.51 m of 1.31 g/t Au (Figure 3). Avidian President Steve Roebuck states: 'Our 2020 drill program was a success having met its stated objectives of providing preliminary insight into structural controls of mineralization and the resource potential at Amanita. Given the strong assay results and broad intercept widths encountered, Avidian is pleased to announce it plans a follow-up infill drilling program in the area along strike of the high-grade trend identified by hole AM20-02 and Trench D-West, as well as further outline drilling of the other mineralized trends. Our main goal this year is to begin drill defining a near-surface oxide-gold resource only 5 km south of the largest bulk tonnage gold mine and mill complex in Alaska. We think 2021 will be a breakout year for Avidian and our shareholders.' Table 1 summarizes the highlight assay results encountered in all of the holes drilled in 2020 with holes AM20-01 and AM20-02 previously reported. Figures 2 and 3 show the location of the 2020 drill holes with Figure 3 providing preliminary interpretations. Table 1: Significant Gold Intersections in Holes AM20-01 through AM20-09 All assays reported in this table are presented in core length as at this time there is insufficient data with respect to the orientation of the mineralized intersections to calculate true widths. Highlight Descriptions and Preliminary Interpretations (see Figure 3) As previously released on December 17, 2020, hole AM20-02 tested the down-dip extension of the Trench D-West intersection of 27.0 m of 4.22 g/t Au, interpreted to reflect the same mineralized zone targeted by Hole AM20-01 located approximately 200 m to the northeast. The upper part of hole AM20-02 intersected 4.54 m of 0.68 g/t Au and 6.10 m of 1.49 g/t Au, but the highlight intersection is 33.89 m of 2.56 g/t Au, which includes 27.22 m of 3.11 g/t Au, which itself includes 12.87 m of 6.23 g/t Au. This intersection is considered to be the depth extension of the mineralized zone encountered in Trench D-West and remains open along strike and at depth. AM20-01 was designed to pass under the north-trending intersection of 22.5 m of 11.51 g/t Au in Trench C-North and intercept this zone at a vertical depth of approximately 50 m. The upper 75 m of AM20-01 is structurally complex and movement along these structures likely displaced the mineralization as no significant mineralization was intercepted in the upper part of the hole. Several thin anomalous (>0.25 g/t) gold values were encountered, as was one intersection of 3.12 m of 1.39 g/t Au at a depth of 95 m. The NE-SW striking mineral trend between holes AM20-01 and AM20-02 appears to have been tested by historical RC hole AH-14 which intersected 16.76 m of 1.03 g/t Au at a depth of 75 m. AH-14 lies approximately 80 m to the southwest of AM20-01. The structural complexity in the upper 75 m of AM20-01 is also evident in the property-wide magnetic survey that indicates multiple, major, structural trends intersecting in the area of AM20-01. AM20-03 was designed to test for a parallel NE-SW striking mineralized zone similar to that encountered in hole AM20-02 and is located approximately 150 m east of hole AM20-02. Additionally, the objective of this hole was to assess the validity of historical RC hole AH-05, which was a reverse circulation hole that reportedly intersected 22.9 m of 1.01 g/t Au at a vertical depth of approximately 50 m below surface. Hole AM20-03 intersected 24.21 m of 1.3 g/t Au at essentially the same depth interval. Previous blaster analysis work completed in the late 1990's on the historical RC holes (see press release dated January 7, 2020) suggested that the assay results from the RC drilling may have been understated. The results from hole AM20-03 appear to support this suggestion and Avidian plans to re-evaluate a number of the historical RC assay results. The strike of the mineralized zone encountered in hole AM-20-03 appears to be NE-SW trending towards historical hole AH-19, located approximately 150 m to the NE. This historical hole intersected, essentially from surface, 6.10 m of 7.14 g/t Au, including 3.05 m of 14.04 g/t Au. This trend of mineralization is open along strike in both directions and at depth and appears to represent a parallel zone to that encountered in hole AM20-02. Hole AM20-04 is a 180 m step-back of hole AM20-03. This hole intersected 4.02 m of 1.65 g/t Au approximately 45 m below surface and may represent another separate NE-SW parallel mineralized zone to that encountered in hole AM20-03. Holes AM20-05, 06, 07 and 09 were step-out holes investigating geophysical and/or geochemical anomalies as well as obtaining structural information that could assist in follow- up drilling programs that would 1) test for strike extensions to the mineralized zones reported above in the 2020 drill program and 2019 trenching program; 2) outline other mineralized gold zones; and 3) define possible areas where follow-up drilling will be required to test for the potential intrusive source to the gold mineralization encountered to date on the property. Holes AM20-06 and AM20-7 were drilled from the same collar location as AM20-6 was abandoned at 54.25 m due to rock conditions. Hole AM20-07 intersected multiple thin intersections, such as 1.4 m of 2.93 g/t Au and 4.60 m of 1.47 g/t Au that on a preliminary basis appear to trend to the NE into the mineralized zone of 6.10 m of 1.49 g/t Au in AM20-02 (located 250 m to the NE). Hole AM20-08 was drilled subparallel to the mineralized trend encountered in hole AM20-02 to test for cross-cutting structural features that could also be mineralized. This hole encountered near-surface mineralization of 2.93 m of 4.26 g/t Au, including 1.5 m of 8.07 g/t Au, which may be a NE trending zone also encountered at the top of hole AM20-05, located 180 m to the NE, of 1.51 m of 1.31 g/t Au. A lower intersection of 4.29 m of 1.12 g/t Au appears to be a cross-cutting mineralized feature that trends to the NW and could possibly be the same zone as that encountered at surface in Trench D-West (50 m to the SE) that returned 12 m of 1.34 g/t Au. While evaluation of all the drill hole data in conjunction with structural, geophysical and geochemical data is on-going, the results obtained in all of the drill holes indicate at a minimum, drill expansion of the already defined mineralized trends as well as possible new trends will be required. Avidian plans of a follow-up drilling program in 2021 to 1) expand the defined zones that are all open along strike and at depth; 2) commence establishing a preliminary resource outline of those gold zones; 3) further evaluate the possible new mineralized zones encountered in the 2020 drilling program; and 4) drill for the possible intrusive source to the mineralization on the property. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Sampling included insertion of certified standards and blanks into the stream of samples for chemical analysis. Every twentieth surface sample was a standard or a blank. Samples were prepared at ALS Global's laboratory in Fairbanks, Alaska and shipped to their Vancouver facility for gold analysis by fire assay and other elements by ICP analysis. Selected samples were also analyzed by metallic screen analysis. ALS is a certified and accredited laboratory service. Gold results varied from below detection to a high of 22.3 g/t.

The immediate reason for this largesse is Beijing's determination to diplomatically isolate Taiwan. Says Harry Sung of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Washington, D.C.: \"Their top priority is to isolate Taiwan. Most of the remaining countries that recognize Taiwan are located in the Caribbean and Latin America.\" China's cricket diplomacy led to two West Indian countries, Grenada and Dominica, derecognizing Taiwan as an independent country. Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket.

            "text": " Tren Valpara\u00edso Santiago (TVS), a consortium comprised of Sigdo Koppers and China Railway Group Limited, has presented a formal proposal to develop a high-speed rail (HSR) line linking the Chilean capital Santiago with the port city of Valpara\u00edso through the government's concession system. Spanning approximately 120km, the HSR would reduce travel time between the two cities to 45 minutes, a 50% reduction on both driving and public transport journey times. The total estimated investment of the project is between US$1.6 and 2.5 billion, which is proposed to be financed entirely by the private sector. Initially, TVS plans to deliver 12 trains, each with capacity to transport 890 passengers, which will travel at a maximum speed of 200km/h. The Ministry of Public Works (MOP) must now decide if the project is in the public interest. Following the concession procedure, TVS will then carry out feasibility studies, which will be evaluated by the MOP to determine if the proposal can be structured as a concession. If TVS passes these stages, the MOP will launch a tender for the project within a year. The HSR is intended primarily to serve port cargo, with TVS considering adding a connection to San Antonio port. TVS originally submitted a proposal in early 2018 to develop the project through the Railway Law, rather than as a concession. The Ministry of Transport decided that it could not approve the proposal in this model earlier this month. Despite the numerous hurdles remaining before the project can be tendered, prospective bidders are already lining up. Italian firms Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane and Salini-Impregilo have publicly confirmed their interest in the project.

            "text": " In a wide-ranging interview aired Sunday, Harry and Meghan described painful palace discussions about the color of their son\u2019s skin, losing royal protection and the intense pressures that led the Duchess of Sussex to contemplate suicide. The interview with Oprah Winfrey was the couple\u2019s first since they stepped down from royal duties and the two-hour special included numerous revelations likely to reverberate on both sides of the Atlantic. Harry told Winfrey that he felt trapped by royal life and was surprised that he was cut off financially and lost his security last year. He also said he felt his family did not support Meghan, who acknowledged her naivete about royal life before marrying Harry, as she endured tabloid attacks and false stories. Meghan, who is biracial, described that when she was first pregnant with son Archie, there were \u201cconcerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he\u2019s born.\u201d The statement led Winfrey to incredulously ask \u201cWhat?\u201d While Winfrey sat in silence, Meghan said she struggled to understand why there were concerns within the royal family about her son\u2019s skin color. She said it was hard for her to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d those conversations. Meghan, the actor formerly known as Meghan Markle who starred in the TV drama \u201cSuits,\u201d said she grew concerned about her son not having a royal title because it meant he wouldn\u2019t be provided security. Meghan said processing everything during her pregnancy was \u201cvery hard.\u201d More than the \u201cprince\u201d title, she felt the most troubled over her son\u2019s safety and protection. \u201cHe needs to be safe,\u201d a teary-eyed Meghan recalled. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying don\u2019t make him a prince or princess, whatever it\u2019s going to be. But if you\u2019re saying the title is going to affect their protection, we haven\u2019t created this monster machine around us in terms of click bait and tabloid fodder. You\u2019ve allowed that to happen, which means our son needs to be safe.\u201d The interview was broadcast in the United States a full day before it will air in Britain. The revelations aren\u2019t over: Winfrey teased unaired bits of the interview would be shown Monday morning on CBS. In a rare positive moment in the interview, Harry and Meghan revealed their second would be a girl. The interview opened with Winfrey gushing over Meghan\u2019s pregnancy and lamenting that COVID-19 protocols kept them from hugging. Winfrey at various points in the interview ran through headlines about Meghan and at one point asked about the mental health impact. Meghan responded that she experienced suicidal thoughts and had sought help through the palace\u2019s human resources department, but was told there was nothing they could do. \u201cI was really ashamed to say it at the time and a shame to have to admit it to Harry, especially because I know how much loss he suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I knew that if I didn\u2019t say it that I would do it. And I just didn\u2019t, I just didn\u2019t want to be alive anymore.\u201d Harry, too, said there are lasting impacts about Meghan\u2019s treatment and his relationship with his family. \u201cThere is a lot to work through there,\u201d Harry said about his relationship with his father. \u201cI feel really let down. He\u2019s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like. And Archie is his grandson. I will always love him, but there is a lot of hurt that has happened.\u201d Harry said the royal family cut him off financially at the start of 2020 after announcing plans to step back from his roles. But he was able to afford security for his family because of the money his mother, Princess Diana, left behind. In response to a question from Winfrey, Harry said he wouldn\u2019t have left royal life if not for his wife. He said their relationship revealed the strictures of royal life. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to, because I myself was trapped,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a way out. \u201cI was trapped, but I didn\u2019t know I was trapped,\u201d Harry said, before adding, \u201cMy father and my brother, they are trapped.\u201d Harry acknowledged that he does not have a close relationship presently with his brother William, who is heir to the throne after their father, Prince Charles. Harry disputed rumors that he intentionally blindsided his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, with his decision to split. He suspects the rumors came from the institution. \u201cI\u2019ve never blindsided my grandmother,\u201d he said. \u201cI have too much respect for her.\u201d Meghan, too, was complimentary toward the queen, despite saying at one point she realized some in the palace were willing to lie to \u201cprotect other members of the family.\u201d \u201cThe queen has always been wonderful to me,\u201d Meghan said. Sunday\u2019s interview special opened with Meghan describing how na\u00efve she was about the ground rules of royal life before she married her husband, Harry, nearly three years ago. \u201cI didn\u2019t fully understand what the job was,\u201d she said. She also noted that she did not know how to curtsy before meeting Queen Elizabeth II for the first time, and didn\u2019t realize it would be necessary. \u201cI will say I went into it naively because I didn\u2019t grow up knowing much about the royal family,\u201d Meghan said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that was part of conversation at home. It wasn\u2019t something that we followed.\u201d Meghan said she and Harry were aligned during their courtship because of their \u201ccause-driven\u201d work. But she did not fully comprehend the pressure of being linked to the prestigious royal family. \u201cThere was no way to understand what the day-to-day was going to be like,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so different because I didn\u2019t romanticize any element of it.\u201d The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018, and their son, Archie, was born a year later. Harry and Meghan\u2019s departure from royal duties began in March 2020 over what they described as the intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media toward the duchess. At the top of the interview, Winfrey said no topic was off limits and that Meghan and Harry were not being paid for the special. In Britain, the interview is seen as poorly timed. It will air while Harry\u2019s 99-year-old grandfather Prince Philip remains hospitalized in London after undergoing a heart procedure. It is unclear what public reaction, if any, the queen and other royal family members will have to Sunday\u2019s interview. The U.K.\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper, citing an anonymous source, reported that the queen would not watch it.

En un comunicado del MTOP se indic\u00f3 que esta cartera de Estado opt\u00f3 por la construcci\u00f3n del hospital de Pedernales con una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito con el Banco de Desarrollo de la Rep\u00fablica Popular de China (China Development Bank). Esta empresa tuvo notoriedad laboral en Ecuador en el gobierno del expresidente Rafael Correa, espec\u00edficamente desde el 2012. Seg\u00fan el comunicado del MTOP, esta constructora ejecut\u00f3 proyectos por 871,7 millones de d\u00f3lares. La obra debe estar en un plazo de 365 d\u00edas una vez firmado el contrato y aunque no se especific\u00f3 el monto total, la semana pasada \u00d3scar Arcentales, alcalde de Pedernales, indic\u00f3 que tendr\u00e1 un costo de 16 millones de d\u00f3lares. De concretarse la adjudicaci\u00f3n de la obra, ser\u00e1 el tercer intento para que se construya el hospital. El proceso de contrataci\u00f3n del hospital de Pedernales tuvo dos procesos fallidos de construcci\u00f3n tras denuncias de corrupci\u00f3n, en especial el \u00faltimo que dej\u00f3 detenidos a representantes de la compa\u00f1\u00eda constructora, y al exlegislador manabita Daniel Mendoza y otros funcionarios que son investigados por presuntos actos lesivos a los intereses del pa\u00eds. Pero no solo el Hospital de Especialidades de Portoviejo ha construido la empresa China CAMC Engineering, ya que tambi\u00e9n se adjudic\u00f3 las obras de los hospitales general Monte Sina\u00ed y del Guasmo Sur en Guayaquil, al igual que del hospital est\u00e1ndar de Esmeraldas. Tambi\u00e9n ejecut\u00f3 la obra de la Plataforma gubernamental norte en Quito por 97,7 millones de d\u00f3lares, entre otros proyectos p\u00fablicos.

We cannot afford to repeat that disaster.\u201d Cooper was highly critical of the Minnis administration\u2019s handling of the COVID pandemic. \u201c\u2026Despite the government\u2019s propaganda on this topic, The Bahamas has performed quite poorly on COVID in comparison to a great many of our regional neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen measured by cases and deaths per 100,000, The Bahamas was outperformed by many Caribbean nations, including Haiti, Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago. \u201cWith the right policies in place to stop COVID outbreaks, even if more transmissible variants come to our country, we can avoid more lockdowns, and focus on alleviating the economic crisis.\u201d The government expects to have 50,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine before the end of the month. The government says the vaccines will be administered at no charge to those being inoculated. "

CHEC Jamaica Country Manager, Dangran Bi said the company\u2019s current projects, which include the long-awaited Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project, are in advance stages of preparation and will begin on schedule despite the travel ban. \u201cAs a company, we are definitely watching with great seriousness the developments surrounding the coronavirus outbreak currently affecting sections of China. However, it is important to note that this outbreak and the travel restrictions have not and will not negatively affect our current and upcoming projects as we already have the staff complement here in Jamaica to be able to operate at full capacity,\u201d Bi said. He continued, \u201cWe did have a very small handful of staff members who returned to China to celebrate the Chinese New Year and who have now been affected by the travel restrictions, however, we have identified ways for them to work remotely and this will not affect any of our current projects.\u201d CHEC Jamaica also has on its roster for this year the construction of over 1,600 homes at Catherine Estates, the Morant Bay Urban Development Centre, the Kingston Freeport Logistics Hub which is currently under construction and expansion works at the Norman Manley International Airport. According to the CHEC Jamaica boss, work on the Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project has effectively begun with the site offices for the various sections being constructed and work being done to clear sections of the roadway. He said, over its lifetime, the project is expected to employ over 350 employees, with more than 80 per cent expected to be Jamaicans.

            "text": " (Bloomberg) -- The European Union must take a tougher stance against Russia\u2019s \u201cprovocative and assertive\u201d relationship with the bloc, according to Romania\u2019s foreign minister. Sanctions over the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and the recent poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny have had a limited impact, Bogdan Aurescu said in an interview. A new strategy to deal with the Kremlin should also seek to boost independent Russian media and civil society, and aim for a more \u201cinfluential\u201d EU role in solving regional conflicts, such as the one between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s clear room for improvement and there\u2019s a need for broader actions,\u201d Aurescu said Friday by phone. He expects the EU Council to discuss the issues at its next meeting this month. The EU has faced criticism for resisting calls by Navalny\u2019s allies to sanction billionaires and bankers close to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, instead opting to penalize four Russians from the law-enforcement sphere. While the U.S. has initially followed suit, it\u2019s also considering measures that could target oligarchs or the nation\u2019s sovereign debt. The EU\u2019s response to Navalny\u2019s attempted assassination followed a visit to Moscow last month by its foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, during which his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, disparaged the bloc. Aurescu said it\u2019s clear Russia doesn\u2019t want to have a normal relationship with the EU. While some sanctions may not have had \u201ca spectacular effect,\u201d a failure to impose any punishment \u201cwould have sent a totally negative signal to the international community,\u201d he said. Aurescu singles out coronavirus vaccinations, which have taken on a geopolitical element, as an area where more action is needed. Russia and China are already shipping their domestically developed shots to EU member state Hungary, as well as countries bordering the bloc, including Serbia and Montenegro. \u201cI hope the EU will speed up its efforts to become present in these countries with approved vaccines to avoid a worsening of this vaccine crisis,\u201d Aurescu said.

            "text": " A makeshift memorial in Minneapolis for George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer,  Jan. 18, 2021. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on Monday in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged in connection with Floyd's death. (Octavio\u2026 more OCTAVIO JONES Editor's note:\u00a0This story is available as a result of a content partnership with The New York Times. Subscribers will see stories like this every day on our website (and in our daily emails) as an added value to your subscription. MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Late last year, a 14-page questionnaire began to arrive in mailboxes across Minneapolis and its suburbs. It asked if the recipient had watched the video of George Floyd dying under a police officer\u2019s knee. What about the protests against police brutality, it wanted to know \u2014 did you go? How do you feel about Black Lives Matter? It asked respondents to list their education level, any martial arts training, even their favorite podcasts. And then there was the essay prompt, followed by a daunting expanse of blank paper: Tell us everything you have heard about the death of Floyd. The questionnaire went out to potential jurors for the trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer accused of murdering Floyd, who was Black. The case has touched the lives of millions and sparked the largest movement for racial justice in America since the 1960s, but the trial will ultimately decide the guilt or innocence of one man. Jury selection is set to begin Monday in a courtroom built to comply with pandemic protocols and outfitted with television cameras. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Before his trial begins, he could face an additional charge of third-degree murder, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Friday, in a decision that could delay the start of jury selection because Chauvin has the option to appeal. Trials in police killings are rare. This one comes during a seismic shift in attitudes about race, racism and policing sparked, in large part, by the videos showing Floyd pinned underneath officers for more than nine minutes. The videos show him crying for his mother as onlookers pleaded with the officers to let him breathe. The trial follows months of protests by those who want the criminal justice system to hold the police accountable for violence, punctuated by sharp disappointments like a lack of indictments for officers in the deaths of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York. Prosecutors will probably show the video in court as much as the judge will allow, to argue that Chauvin\u2019s use of force violated Police Department policy and that he committed murder by keeping his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck even after Floyd went silent. The defense will attempt to portray what many view as a simple set of facts captured on video as something more complicated, probably by arguing that Floyd\u2019s drug use and underlying health conditions were the real cause of his death. Jury selection is set to begin Monday in a courtroom built to comply with pandemic protocols and outfitted with television cameras. Minneapolis, where neighborhoods and storefronts still bear the scars of last summer\u2019s looting and arson, is already bracing for unrest if Chauvin is acquitted. Concrete barriers around government buildings and high fencing topped with razor wire have transformed downtown into a fortress and blocked off one of the most popular sites for large demonstrations. National Guard soldiers will stand watch. Floyd\u2019s family will gather, along with social justice activists and civil rights leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who recently told reporters that Chauvin \u201clynched George Floyd with his knee.\u201d And there are fears that members of the same white supremacist groups that ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 might descend on the Twin Cities. Inside the courtroom, though, a slow and deliberative process will play out as questioners probe prospective jurors for signs that they have already made up their minds. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult to pick a jury,\u201d said Susan Gaertner, the former top prosecutor in nearby St. Paul who is now in private practice. \u201cThere have been few incidents in our state that have had as much impact on the community. It\u2019s hard to imagine finding a juror who is enough of a blank slate to really give both sides a fair hearing.\u201d It is expected to take three weeks just to seat a jury of 12 members and up to four alternates. Lawyers for both sides may have already begun vetting jury pool members, checking their social media posts. They will have read the returned questionnaires, which are not publicly available, and will use them as a starting point for questions intended to ferret out anything that is \u201cproxy for political bias,\u201d down to their bumper stickers, said Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul. The questions will help the lawyers pinpoint ideological leanings and flesh out fuller portraits of each prospective juror. The defense will be looking for candidates who are politically conservative and favorably disposed toward law enforcement, while the prosecution may prefer young, highly educated people with liberal leanings. The judge is supposed to strike any potential jurors who show an inability to set aside their preconceptions. In addition, the prosecution may strike nine potential jurors of its choice, and the defense may strike 15. Judge Peter Cahill has taken special steps to protect the jury from interference and security threats. Jurors will not be publicly identified during the trial. They will be sequestered during deliberations and possibly during the trial itself. Inside the courtroom, pandemic-related precautions will allow for only two spectators: one from Floyd\u2019s family and one from Chauvin\u2019s. Three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death \u2014 J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao \u2014 will be tried separately. Cahill has denied a motion by Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, to move the trial because of the enormous amount of publicity it has already generated, but the judge said he might reconsider. Dan Herbert, a criminal defense lawyer who has represented numerous police officers including Jason Van Dyke, who was convicted in 2019 of murdering Laquan McDonald in Chicago, said the problem with holding the trial in Minneapolis was not so much that residents could not be impartial but that they might be swayed by intense community pressure. \u201cIt will be much easier for them to come back with a verdict of guilty than a verdict of not guilty,\u201d he said. The defense should be looking for one or two holdouts who would not cave to public opinion, he said. \u201cYou\u2019re just looking for somebody that is a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd somebody who\u2019s maybe even going to stay aloof from the other jurors.\u201d Moving the trial would inevitably mean moving it to a whiter area of Minnesota, in a case where the racial makeup of the jury will be a primary concern. In the Rodney King case in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, the four officers caught on video beating King were acquitted after their trial was moved to the predominantly white suburb of Simi Valley, touching off violent riots. At around the same time in Minneapolis, protests rocked the city following an all-white grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a white officer, Dan May, who fatally shot a Black teenager in the back. Minneapolis is about 64% white and 20% Black, while the jury pool in its county, Hennepin, was 80% white and 8% Black in the 2020 fiscal year, according to figures from the State Court Administrator\u2019s Office. The difference reflects the fact that the county is whiter than the city and Black potential jurors tend to be slightly underrepresented in the pool. Jury diversity is important for two reasons, experts said. Research shows that just as diverse corporations and institutions perform better, so do juries, benefiting from multiple perspectives. And if the jury lacks racial diversity, its verdict would likely not be viewed as legitimate. Paul Butler, a former prosecutor and professor at Georgetown Law, expressed concern that some questions, like asking whether prospective jurors agreed with a series of statements about race and policing, might be used to disqualify people of color even when the statement is objectively true \u2014 for example, the statement \u201cMinneapolis police officers are more likely to respond with force when confronting Black suspects than when dealing with white suspects.\u201d But Herbert, the defense lawyer, said private polling conducted before the Van Dyke trial showed that the vast majority of Black residents were predisposed to convict. \u201cIn these police cases where it\u2019s a white police officer and a Black victim, it is virtually impossible to find a significant number of Blacks that have not prejudged the case for many reasons, not the least of which is what they have gone through, likely, in the past.\u201d On the other hand, legal experts say, having too many white jurors would probably stack the deck in favor of the defense, because people tend to have less natural empathy for someone of a different race \u2014 in this case, Floyd \u2014 and white people are more likely to favor law enforcement. \u201cThe conventional wisdom has been that jurors generally \u2014 and white jurors in particular \u2014 think that even if the officer made a mistake, he or she was just trying to do their job; they\u2019re reluctant to punish,\u201d Butler said. Still, he said, there is now a sense that the conventional wisdom no longer holds. In the months following Floyd\u2019s death, more white people than usual participated in racial justice protests. Polls have shown that the share of Americans who thought racism was a significant problem increased, though the percentage of white Americans who thought so remained significantly lower than the percentage of Black Americans who did. Still, experts like Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who tracks police crime, say they have yet to see such changes manifested in the courtroom. \u201cI think that many jurors are still very reluctant to convict police officers in these criminal cases,\u201d Stinson said. Many of Floyd\u2019s supporters fear that Chauvin will be acquitted despite the harrowing video footage of Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cI know a lot of folks believe it\u2019s a slam dunk because of the existence of the bystander video,\u201d said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and activist in Minneapolis, at a recent community forum hosted by the Legal Rights Center, a nonprofit group that provides indigent defense and advocates for criminal justice reform. \u201cBut we know that videos have meant nothing in terms of officers being held accountable.\u201d Selwyn Jones, Floyd\u2019s uncle who lives in South Dakota, will travel to Minneapolis for the trial, rooting for a conviction but preparing for the possibility of an acquittal and the chaos he thinks could ensue. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the outcome we want, I\u2019m going to chalk it up to being a Black man in America,\u201d he said \u00a9 2021 American City Business Journals.

The governments around the world adopted social confinement measures to combat COVID-19, which has resulted in the closure of higher education institutions. Faced with multiple challenges, faculties rapidly converted curriculum to an online environment, which is anticipated to occur without sufficient preparation. Therefore, this study conducted a survey of students in post-secondary private institutions throughout Oman, to understand different approaches adopted by academic institutions to deliver education during the COVID-19 restriction, and the consequences of these restrictions on academic activities and quality of education. Moreover, the extent to which personal and financial circumstances have created challenges for students to continue their education is also analyzed. A total of 213 respondents completed the study, which were overrepresented by students enrolled in bachelors programme. The student satisfaction from the arrangement and delivery of education online was not more than 50 percent. The exams were cancelled and replaced by extra coursework in most cases, and in some cases students were assessed based on only the existing coursework. The major concern for many students (40%) was the inability to pay tuition fees due to the financial implication caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n        Abushammala, M., \n        Qazi, W., \n            & \n        Manchiryal, R.\n    (2021).\n    The impact of COVID-19 on the private higher education system and students in Oman.\n    Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice, 18(3).\n        https://ro.uow.edu.au/jutlp/vol18/iss3/013\n 303 DOWNLOADS Since March 07, 2021 \nPlum Print visual indicator of research metricsPlumX MetricsUsageAbstract Views: 474Downloads: 307CapturesReaders: 19Social MediaTweets: 1see details\n \nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nAddThis\n \n\n\t\t\tAdvanced Search\n\t\t\n \nHome | \n        About | \n        FAQ | \n        My Account | \n        Accessibility Statement\n \nPrivacy\nCopyright\n"

The certificate and key were presented to the Minister for Education and Human Resource Development, Petter Saint Jean by Chinese Ambassador to Dominica, Li Jiangning on Wednesday 20 January 2016 at the Ministry of Education. The Dominica and Chinese Governments signed a six million dollars contract for the new school in October 2013 as the thirty-year old existing building was in a state of deterioration, coupled with persistent threat of slope failure posing danger to students. The school, which is a grant from the Chinese Government, was expected to be completed within fourteen months of the contract signing but suffered a few set-backs. \u201cI\u2019m happy to inform today that the Newtown Primary School, funded by the People\u2019s Republic of China is now complete and as of the second week of January, the students of Newtown and surrounding areas actually moved to the new school, marking the commencement of the new school term,\u201d Minister Saint Jean said. Chinese Ambassador to Dominica, Li Jiangning presenting the certificate of completion to Minister for Education and Human Resource Development, Petter Saint Jean He added that the school, which comprises of fourteen (14) classrooms and can accommodate three hundred (300) students, was not significantly affected during the passage of Tropical Storm Erika and the contractors were able to put the finishing touches in the last couple of months of 2015. \u201cTwo weeks ago, officials of the Ministry of Education, along with the Project Supervisor visited the site of the new school to assess its readiness for opening. I was advised that all is in place, including the procurement of all furniture for the effective functioning of the school. The new school is truly a state of the art facility, a modern structure that caters for the needs of students,\u201d Minister Saint Jean informed. \u201cThe school boosts large student friendly classroom, rooms for art and craft, information technology, a library, a kitchen to facilitate the school feeding program, and comfortable office space and staff quarters for school administration and teachers. Other amenities include a sick bay and a new feature to our schools in Dominica, an elevator that caters for the needs of the physically challenged students,\u201d he continued. The Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development is planning an official commissioning ceremony for later this year as \u201cwork is ongoing on the school grounds\u201d. \u201cWhile significant progress has been made to level and prepare the yard for sporting activities and to clear the grounds of all debris associated with building, the construction of the perimeter fence will continue well into the month of February,\u201d Mr Saint Jean said.  The Ministry of Education, he added, \u201cis extremely pleased with the new school\u201d and thanked the People\u2019s Republic of China for this gift of \u201ca long overdue educational institution to the people of Newtown\u201d for which the government and people \u201care profoundly grateful\u201d. Meanwhile, to the Chinese Ambassador and government, the completion of the new Newtown Primary School is \u201canother example of our strong friendship and cooperation between our two countries\u201d Ambassador Li added that the eleven-year diplomatic relations between China and Dominica, \u201chas come a long way and many achievements have been made\u201d.

Australia has \u201chigh potential\u201d to become a global powerhouse of green hydrogen energy generation and accelerate the renewables market\u2019s growth, according to new research. A recent study by market analyst Fitch Solutions now claims that non-hydro renewable energy generation will make up close to a third (30%) of Australia\u2019s total power mix by the end of the decade, driven by growth in green hydrogen production. At the same time as Australia\u2019s renewables market is growing, the thermal power sector is expected to face early closures due to its inability to compete, the report said. On this basis, Fitch has changed its forecast for non-hydro renewables as a share of the country\u2019s 2030 power generation mix from 24.7% last June to 30.1%. It now predicts that non-hydro renewables capacity will increase by an annual average rate of 5.5% over the next nine years, totalling 47.4GW by 2030.  Coal production, on the other hand, is expected to fall by around 1.2% annually until 2030, as continued falling wholesale electricity prices make it harder for coal-fired plants to stay economically viable. Total thermal generation is now expected to make up 62% of the overall power mix by the end of the decade, far less than the more than two thirds (69.3%) expected in Fitch\u2019s previous report on the market last year. Developers in Australia have a construction pipeline of green hydrogen projects totalling close to 30GW, it said, compared to just over 10GW in Germany and in the Netherlands, the country\u2019s closest competitors. The estimate comes a year after The Western Australian government earmarked AU$20 million (US$15.32 million) in funding to boost the state\u2019s hydrogen industry. By January, it had received 65 expressions of interest (EOI) to produce and export renewable hydrogen from up to 1,250MW of solar and 270MW of wind generation. Fitch also noted that Australia has become more advanced than many countries in both renewable energy price reductions and creating a \u201ccommercially viable\u201d large-scale battery storage sector, putting it in a strong position to support further renewables growth and pose \u201cstructural risks\u201d to the thermal power sector. Local authorities have placed more investment in advancing green hydrogen technologies in recent months. Advisory group Infrastructure Australia highlighted a handful of clean energy projects in its recent Priority List this year, including a solar-plus-storage transmission project in the Northern Territory that aims to supply 20% of Singapore\u2019s electricity demand. It includes a 13GW solar farm, set to be the world\u2019s largest on completion, plus 27GWh of critical battery storage. \u201cWe initially expected renewables growth to slow due to grid connection bottlenecks with larger scale facilities,\u201d the Fitch report said, but added that \u201crapid progress with green hydrogen and energy storage facilities\u201d has enabled further capacity to come online and be used. It said that more advances in the exporting value of green hydrogen could unlock \u201cfurther scope for capacity growth previously bound by domestic market constraints\u201d."

A first in the Caribbean region for China Aid, the project exceeded target to repair 250 damaged roofs to strengthened national building code standards, with a total of 302 homes and essential facilities served with roofing materials, during the six-month relief and recovery project completed on 30 June. \u201cThanks to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the People\u2019s Republic of China, the project exceeded all targets and expectations - this is a model that can be replicated in other countries - providing significant help, and stronger resilience against future hurricanes,\u201d said Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne at the Closing Ceremony in Codrington, Barbuda on 12 July 2018. The Chinese Government made a significant commitment to restore 250 damaged roofs under a Build Back Better Principle and, with government, \u201cUNDP designed the project to procure and transport reroofing materials to Barbuda and provide technical assistance to the National Office of Disaster Services (NODS) and building contractors,\u201d said UNDP Resident Representative Barbados & OECS, Mr Stephen O\u2019Malley. \u201cAs we drove today, we can see so many more children on the island now, looking much happier,\u201d he commented on the number of families returning to Barbuda and their newly repaired homes, after nine months of living away following evacuation of all 1800 residents when Irma destroyed the tropical island. Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to Antigua and Barbuda HE Wang Xianmin was impressed by the speed of the rebuilding which began on his first visit to the Irma-stricken Barbuda in January 2018 \u2013 and success of the new trilateral model under South-South Cooperation - with the People\u2019s Republic of China providing the funds for reroofing materials, the government hiring contractors and coordinating repairs, and UNDP implementing the project. Authorities during the ceremony highlighted that the initiative provided significant help, and stronger resilience against future hurricanes, to the disaster impacted island. A thousand people have now returned to Barbuda, as estimated by Red Cross \u2013 over half the population of this small Caribbean island -  but an estimated $222 million is still needed to repair the damage, according to national assessments. \u201cIt will take time \u2013 but Barbuda has made more progress than other islands in the region, we need to be appreciative of the assistance already received from our donor friends,\" said Prime Minister Browne. \u201cToday, the landscape has changed for the better \u2013 a different story to what I saw a few hours after the hurricane\u201d. Joint project: A Hurricane Irma rebuilding initiative, this is a joint project implemented by UNDP with the Government of Antigua & Barbuda (National Office of Disaster Services \u2013 NODS) supported by the China Aid program under South-South Cooperation. \nAntigua and Barbuda\n+ 2 more\n \nAntigua and Barbuda\n+ 1 more\n \nAntigua and Barbuda\n+ 1 more\n \nAntigua and Barbuda\n+ 3 more\n ReliefWeb's blog ReliefWeb Labs projects explore new and emerging opportunities to improve information delivery to humanitarians.

According to anti-terrorism investigators in the southern city of Bari, the man gave direct support to the Islamist suicide bombers and gunmen, to whom he \"guaranteed the availability of forged documents\", a police statement said. Some 130 people were killed and 350 wounded in a night of carnage on 13 November 2015, when Islamist suicide bombers and gunmen attacked sites, including the Bataclan concert hall, the Stade de France and the bar Le Carillon. Investigators believe the arrested man was part of an Islamic State cell operating in France and Belgium with his two brothers, according to Italian media. La Repubblica daily named him as Athmane Touami, adding that he had reportedly already been in prison in Bari for carrying false documents and was due to be released in June. The detention order, according to the paper, states that since 2010, Touami and his brothers also had contact with Amedy Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi, two of the extremists in the Paris attacks of January 2015, who attacked a Jewish supermarket and the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, respectively.

            "text": " Tumatumari Hydroelectric Re-Development Project The Tumatumari hydropower station is sited approximately 11 km upstream of the Potaro River, a tributary of the Essequibo River in Region 8 of Guyana, South America. It was constructed and commissioned in 1956 and initially operated up to the late 1950\u2019s, by the B.G. Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd, a Canadian Investor, and was again operated by the Guyana National Service (G.N.S) from 1970 up to 1990, after which it was abandoned, and subsequently considerably vandalized. The facilities comprised of two 750 kW hydro turbines, related civil works and electro-mechanical auxiliary plant and a concrete weir structure barring the river and forming a \u2018run-of-the-river\u2019 hydropower station. Basic civil-works as provision for the probable future expansion of the power station by a further two similar units was originally included. The power generated was originally used to propel mining dredges as well as for gold-recovery processes, for gold mines located at Tumatumari, and also at Konawaruk approximately 14 km away. The Tumatumari Hydropower Incorporated (THI) is a special purpose company with the specific objective to re-develop the project, and possibly develop further projects in the future. THI holds a 50 years land lease agreement for the lands of the hydropower plant with a validity of 50 years, starting in 2013. Preliminary discussions were held with the Government of Guyana and a private gold mining company for purchasing electricity from the Tumatumari hydropower plant. With the support of the German international cooperation (GIZ), Sven Homscheid Hydropower + RE Consulting conducted a study comparing several technical options for its economic viability. The economic comparison of options closed recommending the installation of two new Francis turbines with 1.1 MW generating capacity each with new appurtenant equipment into the existing powerhouse as best option. Furthermore, the weir structure requires minor repair works to sustain the natural forces of the river over the next decades. The design parameters are: Sven Homscheid Hydropower + RE Consulting was hired to provide the following services Sven Homscheid Hydropower + RE Consulting concluded the project successfully in September 2016, and the developer was consequently able to negotiate the details of a financing agreement for the project with a potential private sector equity investor.

            "text": " ACCESSWIRE08 Mar 2021, 21:01 GMT+10  TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2021 / Roscan Gold Corporation ('Roscan' or the 'Company') (TSX-V:ROS) (FSE:2OJ) (OTC:RCGCF) is pleased to announce positive diamond drill results (Figure 1) from an additional 8 holes totaling 2,797 meters (m) at its Southern Mankouke Discovery. DDMan-20-89 intersected 4.78gpt over 24m from 7.5m including 32.9gpt over 2m which is a New Discovery Zone 150M West of the Main Mankouke South Discovery Area. This hole appears to outline another parallel system to Mankouke South and highlights the potential to expand the resource footprint to the west. The new discovery area lies directly on trend to the strong geomagnetic signature of Mankouke West, our KN1 discovery area and Kabaya, further to the NE. This new discovery reinforces the importance of our recent acquisition of the Mankouke West land package which will be a core focus of our 2021 target prioritization work. In addition to our new discovery, recent drilling encountered multiple significant intercepts in Fresh Rock deeper in the Southern Mankouke Zone. DDMan-20-86 (Figure 1 and Figure 2) intersected 2.36 gpt over 30m from 162.5m. DDMan-20-85 (Figure 1 and Figure 2) intersected 6.01gpt over 7m from 154.3m including 18.0gpt over 2m from 158.3m with the deepest part of the hole intersecting 1.2gpt over 18M from 263.3 to 281.3m increasing the true vertical depth of our Mankouke discovery to 220m and remains open at depth (Figure 3). During the rainy season due to seasonal access issues, we had only 1 rig on Southern Mankouke but now plan to move a second diamond drilling rig to into the area to further expand upon this new discovery zone. Drilling Highlights: - Diamond Drill Holes Notes: 1: True width yet to be determined, 2: Table 1 - Assay Highlights, 3: 0.5gpt used as cut-off with 4m internal dilution for drill holes, and 4: No top-cut. Nana Sangmuah, President and CEO, stated, 'Hole 89 is an exciting new discovery for Roscan and has the potential to be another high-grade zone which runs parallel to Mankouke South. This new zone confirms our geological thesis of multiple parallel zones that are close to surface, high-grade and can quickly add ounces and scale to the Kandiole project. Hole 89 also emphasizes the value and potential associated with our Western Mankouke land package where a strong geomagnetic signature, coupled with the results of Hole 89, have us quite eager to begin exploration on that land package. We were extremely pleased to intersect gold mineralization in all 8 holes, reflecting a 100% success rate, while increasing the depth and footprint of our flagship target. What is equally compelling is the continuous intersections of Fresh Rock at Southern Mankouke highlighted by hole 86, which encountered our best gram meter intercept to date in the fresh rock. With several holes now having intercepted gold mineralization in the fresh rock our confidence continues to increase that the feed source of the deposit should culminate in tracing a big system analogous to some of the known large deposits in the region. As we await the final interpretation of our high-resolution geophysics survey, we remain focused on testing the full potential of our large tenement package, in order to yield more discoveries and expand on the success at Southern Mankouke (Figure 2). With 5 distinct discoveries made in the last 14 months (Southern Mankouke, Kabaya, Kandiole North, Moussala and Wallia), we are very pleased to potentially add a 6th new focus area with this Western Step Out discovery to Mankouke South. Drilling in 2021 continues to unlock the potential of our highly prospective land package, which should lead to more news flow in the coming weeks.'  Figure 1: Plan View of the Southern Mankouke Drilling  Figure 2: Cross Section Depicting the Extension to Vertical Depth to 220m - DDMan-20-85  Figure 3: Geophysics data showing the major structure on Hole DDMAN-21-89 Geology The gold mineralization at Mankouke South is located approximately 25km east of the Fekola mine (B2Gold Corp.). Gold mineralization in Mankouke South occurs within hydrothermally altered and sheared metasediments of the Kofi formation which include greywacke, limestone and diamictite. The Mankouke South deposit is located within the sheared eastern limb of a fold within hydrothermally altered greywacke-diamictite-carbonate rocks directly above a footwall unit of finely banded and alternating graphitic shale and limestone referred to as the dirty limestone ('DLS'). The Mankouke South mineralization clearly occurs in the rock package above the DLS and has been enriched, upgraded, and concentrated by subsequent folding and shearing of the fold limbs. This deposit is therefore structurally controlled. The gold intersection of 4.78 gpt gold over 24 metres in DDMAN 21 -89 again points out the extensive near surface oxide gold mineralization along this structural corridor.

            "text": " Friday, october 15 Name day: Hedviga, Helvijs, Eda More Eurostat data show that although the last year was like a rollercoaster, after the first shock of the spring, the retail sector has found a way to survive.\u00a0 So far the most dramatic restrictions in the European retail sector were introduced in March and April, when it became clear to everyone that the pandemic was serious, but there was not much understanding how to live with it. In many European countries, nearly all shops were closed at this time, with the exception of essentials, in order to minimize people's gathering in one place. The summer could be considered a moment of respite, as the reins of the restrictions were loosened with the level of infection decreasing. However, as the second wave of the pandemic began in the autumn, which in a number of countries, including the Baltics, appeared to be much harsher than the first, more and more restrictions were once again introduced. The retail trade index of the European Union (EU), produced by Eurostat, shows that if in March and April trading volumes across Europe fell\u00a0and people\u00a0purchased only food and essentials, then autumn and winter, even though there is fluctuation, did not show such a huge drop in volumes.\u00a0Traders and consumers have learned to live with the new situation, as well as expand sales on the Internet Looking at the EU Member States individually, the situation is not as simple. The fact that retail trade volumes in Latvia and Lithuania were not increasing at the end of the year, as in some other EU countries, but declining, is also proof that the epidemiological situation here was much worse. In Latvia, according to Eurostat, retail trade volumes decreased by 4.4% in December compared to the same timeframe a year ago. Lithuania experienced a 1% drop, and Estonia, on the contrary, an increase of 5.9%.\u00a0 \"In the first half of December, we observed gift-buying fever. But the significantly tougher restrictions in the second half of December took a toll. Compared with November, retail sales fell 5.7% in December, making it a 4.4% drop in the year. Despite the virus crisis, 1.5% growth was seen in retail sales in 2020,\" Swedbank economist Laura Orle\u0101ne said. Luminor spokesman P\u0113teris Strauti\u0146\u0161, commenting on last year's developments in retail, said\u00a0that the government must\u00a0seriously consider changing the retail regulation model. \u201cThe situation is becoming critical to both sellers and people who don't have opportunities to buy goods on the Internet. It does not seem possible to maintain the existing rules for several months, so a sustainable solution should be sought. It is necessary to move the rules\u00a0towards those we had in the spring [2020],\u00a0which allowed us both to stop the virus and to achieve a smaller drop in economic activity than in Europe as a whole,\u201d Strauti\u0146\u0161 said. Despite all the problems encountered by Latvian retail last year, none of the largest companies has ceased operations until now. The same cannot be said for all of Europe's retail networks, as some have been forced to close their\u00a0doors altogether. Among the more\u00a0known brands in Latvia, this is the clothing retailer Debenhams. The 240-year-old British network of shops, which employed 12,000 people, after another sales ban in the U.K., announced it wouldn't open its\u00a0doors again. In Latvia, the restrictions are mainly affecting smaller businesses, as these stores are still forbidden to open. Similar stories can be found in a number of European countries. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the pandemic is not over yet and there are likely to be new victims among commercial companies.

            "text": " Citing environmental concerns, the Chilean government canceled HidroAys\u00e9n. Chile's government canceled a controversial plan for five dams on two of Patagonia's wildest rivers Tuesday, after an eight-year battle between environmentalists and developers. Chile's Committee of Ministers overturned the environmental permits for the HidroAys\u00e9n project, which would have put dams on the Baker and Pascua Rivers, flooding 5,900 hectares of land in order to generate hydroelectric power. The committee had previously approved the permits in 2011, but has faced strong public opposition to the plan inside Chile and from the international environmental community. (See related blog post: \"A Battle Over the Quest to Tap Patagonia's Rivers for Energy.\") \"Patagonia's rugged and varied wilderness is truly an environmental treasure,\" Amanda Maxwell, Latin America project director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. \"These giant dams would have put at risk the wilderness, traditional culture, and local tourism economy of this remarkable region.\" Patricio Rodrigo, executive secretary of the Patagonia Defense Council, a coalition of nearly 70 Chilean and international organizations, said in a statement: \"The government's definitive rejection of the HidroAys\u00e9n project is not only the greatest triumph of the environmental movement in Chile, but marks a turning point, where an empowered public demands to be heard and to participate in the decisions that affect their environment and lives.\" The dams were planned for an installed capacity of 2,750 megawatts, which would have provided 15 to 20 percent of the country's energy needs. In recent years Chile has struggled to provide energy for its growing economy. The country has few fossil fuel resources, and imports from Argentina have recently slackened due to that country's rising domestic needs. Imports from Bolivia have been hampered by a border dispute. Replacement Power? To replace the power from the canceled dam, Chile's government says it will add terminals to receive liquid natural gas from abroad and will invest heavily in energy efficiency. The government set a target of cutting energy consumption by 20 percent from the level that it would otherwise reach by 2025. The government has also set a target of producing 20 percent of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2025 (it is currently about 6 percent). Officials have called for solar panels on public buildings and are considering expansion of solar into the Atacama Desert. (See related \"Pictures: Cars Capture Solar Energy in Chilean Desert.\") Also possible are geothermal plants around the country's plentiful active volcanoes and experimental wave and tide projects along Chile's long coastline. The NRDC's Maxwell supports the plan for more renewables. \"The country's future energy needs are better served by building truly sustainable energy: renewables and energy efficiency,\" she said. For their part, Hydroelectric Aysen S.A., the developers of the now-defeated dams, had maintained that the project was needed to provide energy to a growing economy. The plan had incorporated \"the highest environmental standards\" and was being designed to \"minimize the impact on the environment and the social and cultural environment of the area of \u200b\u200binfluence,\" the planners wrote on their official website. Hugh Rudnick, an energy expert at the Catholic University in Santiago, told the BBC that the dam would have been efficient. \"The area to be flooded was very small for the amount of electricity it would have generated,\" he said. But, Rudnick argued, \"it's been defeated by a well-organised campaign by NGOs who've managed to convince the country that it would mean that the whole of Aysen would be flooded.\" Follow Brian Clark Howard on Twitter and Google+.

CTG is the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric operator and one of its largest energy companies. It entered the Chilean market in May 2018 through the acquisition of Atiaia Energ\u00eda, which forms part of Brazil\u2019s Corn\u00e9lio Brennan Group. China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) is the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric operator and one of its largest energy companies. It entered the Chilean market in May 2018 through the acquisition of Atiaia Energ\u00eda, which forms part of Brazil\u2019s Corn\u00e9lio Brennan Group. However, the history of its arrival in Chile dates back to 2014 when InvestChile contacted a subsidiary of CTG, China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE). Since then, Chile\u2019s Foreign Investment Promotion Agency has been in constant contact with the company. This week, a delegation of five persons, led by Li Xiufeng, CTG\u2019s deputy director of marketing, met with InvestChile\u2019s acting director, Ian Frederick, who was accompanied by the executives in charge of the energy sector, Jorge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez and Alicia Zhu. At the meeting, they discussed the progress achieved in recent years on CTG\u2019s installation in Chile. In Chile, CTG has two hydroelectric projects: Rucalhue, with a capacity of 90 MW, in the Biob\u00edo Region, which represents an investment of US$240 million, and the 101-MW R\u00edo Bueno project in the Los R\u00edos Region. \u201cChinese companies have an extremely positive perception of Chile. A few years ago, they knew little about the country. Now they recognize its economic and political stability and show a lot of interest in investing in all the region,\u201d said the acting director of InvestChile. Jorge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, the Agency\u2019s investment promotion executive for the energy sector, added that InvestChile has been in contact with CTG and supporting it for several years. \u201cSince 2014, we have had numerous meetings with the company and its executives, supporting its process of installation with information, invitations to international investment seminars and scheduling and accompanying the company to meetings with other organizations such as the Economy Ministry\u2019s Office for Sustainable Projects, the Energy Ministry, the National Energy Commission and the National Electricity Coordinator,\u201d he reported. It is important to note that InvestChile has Chinese personnel able to provide specific information about different sectors and help companies organize meetings with the leading players of the industries in which they are interested. In China, CTG built and operates the 22.5-GW Three Gorges hydroelectric plant. It has 70 GW of installed capacity and this increases to 124 GW if plants under construction and CTG\u2019s stakes in other companies are included. The company has invested in and developed projects in over 40 countries in Europe, Africa, the Americas and Southeast Asia. In Latin America, it is present in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChile\u2019s foreign investment continues its record-breaking streak: historic figure in July outstrips 2020 FDI by 74%\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tForeign direct investment in Chile hit record high in first half of 2021\u202f\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSinovac announces that it will set up a vaccine plant in Chile\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestChile and Circula el Pl\u00e1stico are looking to attract investment to promote recycling in Chile\t\t\t\t\t\t\t NEW SECTION \ud83e\udd1d| Check out the profiles and stories of a selection of foreign companies that have successfully invested in Chile with the support of InvestChile. @MicrosoftLatam @sojitz_jp @thelivegreenco @HuaweiLatam @ascenty  \n\ud83d\udccc Learn more about them\u2b07\ufe0f \u202f\nhttps://hubs.ly/H0YXVl40 NOTICIAS \ud83d\udcf1| Francesa @HDF_Energy abrir\u00e1 oficinas en #Chile para estudiar nuevas inversiones para el desarrollo de hidr\u00f3geno.

After extensive discussions with industry participants and the German Agricultural Society (DLG), the professional and conceptual sponsor of the trade fair, Koelnmesse sees no alternative but to postpone Anuga FoodTec. The next Anuga FoodTec will take place from 26 to 29 April 2022. \u201cWe sincerely regret that we have to postpone Anuga FoodTec until 2022 despite good preparation and encouragement from the industry. In the past few weeks, however, it has become apparent that there is growing skepticism and concern among all involved. As a result, many companies have pulled out in view of the infection situation and current uncertainty. However, Anuga FoodTec cannot take place without the important key factors of internationality and cross-industry participation. With this in mind, we have responded to the industry\u2019s wish to postpone the trade fair with the new date,\u201d says Oliver Frese, Chief Operating Officer of Koelnmesse. \u201cThe new event date is the best possible solution, taking into consideration the international trade fair calendar, and the available time and space capacities. This allows us to provide the industry with a vision and planning security\u201d. In 2022, the trade fair will take place as a hybrid event, combining both an in-person and digital platform. The addition of a digital platform to the physical component creates the foundation for as many people as possible from Germany and abroad to have access to the latest technologies and processes in the food and beverage industry and for promoting sustainable networking within the industry. \u201cLike the companies, we will use the time to fully prepare ourselves for the upcoming trade fair and boost the industry\u2019s restart further with digital tools and additional reach. Koelnmesse will of course continue to count on the presence of international exhibitors and visitors in April 2022,\u201d continued Frese. \u201cTrade fairs offer the opportunity for products and the people behind them to be experienced through personal interaction and exchange. This is the ideal basis for successful business.\u201d \u201cAs the professional and conceptual sponsor of Anuga FoodTec, we very much regret that the leading international supplier fair for the food and beverage industry will not be able to take place in March 2021 as planned. As a platform for professional exchange across industry boundaries, Anuga FoodTec is a central partner for the entire food sector, focusing on current topics and providing important impetus with the presentation of forward-looking technologies and innovations. We are therefore even more pleased that in spring 2022 \u00a0Anuga FoodTec will once again be the meeting place for the international food technology and supplier industry under the guiding theme \u2018Smart Solutions \u2013 Higher Flexibility'\u201d, says Simone Schiller, Managing Director of the DLG Food Technology Center.Koelnmesse is the organiser of Anuga FoodTec. DLG is the professional and conceptual sponsor of Anuga FoodTec.\u00a0\u00a0Koelnmesse \u2013 Global Competence in Food and FoodTec:Koelnmesse is an international leader in organising food fairs and events regarding food and beverage processing. Trade fairs such as the Anuga, ISM and Anuga FoodTec are established world leaders. Koelnmesse not only organises food and food technology trade fairs in Cologne, Germany, but also in further growth markets around the globe, for example, in Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Italy, Japan, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, which have different focuses and contents.

El capit\u00e1n Jos\u00e9 Vallejo, jefe del GOE en el Azuay, indic\u00f3 que apenas conocieron del accidente se movilizaron hacia el lugar dos equipos especiales con canes adiestrados en ubicaci\u00f3n y rescate de personas, iniciando las labores de b\u00fasqueda. Alrededor de las 04h30 del martes, los rescatistas ubicaron el cuerpo sin vida de Juan Toapanta, de 33 a\u00f1os, mientras que los cuerpos de Carlos Quizphe, Juan Quintu\u00f1a, Asael Quinaluisa a\u00fan contin\u00faan bajo tierra. Vallejo indic\u00f3 que las labores de b\u00fasqueda son complicadas debido a que las condiciones del terreno no son las adecuadas. \u201cLa lluvia en el sector es permanente y debido a la debilidad de la monta\u00f1a, las piedras y tierra caen permanentemente, por lo que la integridad de los rescatistas est\u00e1 en riesgo\u201d, agreg\u00f3 el oficial. Percance De acuerdo a los informes de la Unidad de Negocios Hidroazogues, encargada de la obra, los obreros se encontraban suspendidos con cuerdas y arneses aproximadamente a 80 metros de altura mientras perforaban la roca de la monta\u00f1a para colocar hormig\u00f3n, cuando ocurri\u00f3 el derrumbe y sepult\u00f3 a los trabajadores. El oficial del GOE se\u00f1al\u00f3 que las labores de rescate podr\u00edan tardar varios d\u00edas, ya que las condiciones clim\u00e1ticas no son las \u00f3ptimas, adem\u00e1s se desconoce a qu\u00e9 profundidad estar\u00edan los cuerpos de los trabajadores, adicionalmente la lluvia impide que los canes ubiquen con exactitud los diferentes rastros. /Redacci\u00f3n Azuay.

The ceremony took place on Monday, September 26. Francis, who was at the function but did not address it, expressed his delight on Tuesday at the opening of the facility. \u201cI am delighted with a pleasant duty on behalf of the Roseau South Constituency, particularly Newtown and environs- to express my most sincere and profound gratitude to the Government of Dominica and the people\u2019s Republic of China for the newly constructed Newtown Primary School,\u201d he said. \u201cThe building provides new facilities and a better learning environment for students of the Newtown Primary School. The teachers, parents, students and the entire Newtown Community are excited about this modern facility. And as an educator,\u00a0I am aware that this upgraded physical space has also improved the learning culture for our students.\u201d He added, \u201cWe must now exploit our collective human spirit to infuse the vision and passion that will raise the performance of our students. Our parents must invest more time and effort in the education of our children, while the school managers, Principal, and teachers should strive for nothing less than excellence.\u201d Francis said he has confidence that everyone will make full use of the facility, \u201cnot just for our students, but this modern and well-equipped building will be used for the general education of our community through multiple purposes such as social dialogues, panel discussions, and adult education.\u201d The school was funded through a $6-million grant from the People\u2019s Republic of China. It features fourteen classrooms, a library, science laboratory, art laboratory, kitchen and a sickbay. There is also full Wi-Fi access and a fully equipped computer room as well as personal computers for each teacher. The school grounds were upgraded with a hard court and parking lot. The schoolyard is also fenced and a new roadway was constructed. The new three-storey-high school also includes an elevator to provide access for physically challenged students.

The NTRC has the biggest problem on its hands at the moment in trying to decide on the way forward. The issue of wi-fi in the classroom now brings to the table a call for proposal for new national laws regulating electromagnetic field exposure generated by wireless technology (relay antennas, mobile phones, tablets \u2026). Luckily we can all take a page from France\u2019s bold move in January 2015 http://ehtrust.org/france-new-national-law-bans-wifi-nursery-school/ The medical fraternity must do the research and publicly inform. The DTA must now call for studying the impact of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, including the possible implications for schools and members- Occupational Health and Safety. It is rather ironic that Dominica would move speedily to embrace this technology when Schools across the world are hastily removing the industrial strength routers and replacing them with safe technology. \u201cWi-Fi environments will lead to high microwave exposure for students and teachers which might increase the burden of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress might slow down the energy production especially in brain cells and may lead e.g. to concentration difficulties and memory problems in certain individuals. The Austrian Medical Association recommends Wi-Fi free school environments.\u201d- Gerd Oberfeld, MD, Public Health Department, Salzburg, Austria. http://www.safeinschool.org http://www.parentsforsafetechnology.org/wifi-free-schools.html A Critical observation: The use of Computers and IT in the school must be implemented in a safe manner!!! Research shows that autism, ADHD, and other behavioral problems are also associated with wireless radiation exposure (wi-fi). In May 2011 the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B) based on increased risk of glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer. This classification applies to all RF emitting devices including wi-fi. http://wifiinschools.com/index.html Senior IARC committee chair, and public health scientist, states recently published evidence warrants the reclassification of wireless as a Class 2A probable human carcinogen. Doctors and Scientists around the world have warned against unnecessary exposure of children to RF/microwave from wireless technology and recommend safer WIRED internet connection instead, both in school and at home. http://www.safeinschool\u2026 Joshua Francis is correct. The Government is to be given credit when something positive and beneficial to the communities is provided..Equally we must be very vigilant and critical when they attempt to drift from the straight and narrow path Is this a prime coat, or the real color? Mr. Francis Sir, it is good to know that you are still interested with the things which is taking place in your constituency. I seem to be hearing from you, \u201cthat my people is people and I will join with them for their good regardless of who is head\u201d Good attitude Sir, glorify God in all your ways, for it gives Him delight. It features fourteen classrooms, a library, science laboratory, art laboratory, kitchen and a sickbay. There is also full Wi-Fi access and a fully equipped computer room as well as personal computers for each teacher\u2013news article At reading that statement above, I think about how much more comfortable teaching and learning can be today. If only both teachers and learners could realize it\u2013the fact information is right at the tip of our finger through a simple question about the subject which are dealing with People of Dominica let us strive to stay away from the gloom and darkness of the minds of those who are trying their best to feed it to us from day to day. We need a positive mind, if we are going to move forward and upwards \u2013let us give thanks and gratitude to God for His great blessings and guidance, through all of those whom He has chosen to do so\u2013such as the People\u2019s Republic of China. Yah now change the time of school. So people who trying to get to Roseau not tied up in the traffic jam every morning once it 7 15 This is really great news for the the children, Chinese we say thanks. Investment in education is always a good thing. Nice. How wonderful for the community of Newtown in the Roseau South Constituency.  It is very impressive what this government is doing with the help of our good friends of The People Republic of China. I knew something good was happening or was about to happen when we heard the negative things making the news last week. It makes sense now. The color of the school building is beautiful. I like it. May the students, their teachers and parents spend many positive and happy days in their new school. This Labour Government is working for Dominica and her people. Thank you to our Benefactors and to our Government. Most of us appreciate you and what you doing. May God Bless You. Thank you to the D/ca Government and the People\u2019s Republic of China for this new school. It will serve the teachers, the students and others who will utilize it very well. I thought it was protocol and pure decency when a project is being officially opened in any constituency the Parliamentary representative is allowed to say a few remarks. Even before independence this had been the norm where there wasn\u2019t a parl rep the Village Council Chair person would be next in line.. So whereas the school is welcomed the fact remains the Parl rep should have been allowed to say what he is saying now at the formal function and not after the fact. It just shows our political immaturity and hypocrisy. Just three days ago Blackmoore was calling for patriotic behaviour and for all to be participatory in the development process. He says it does not matter what colour you belong to or what political persuasion all must be allowed to play their part and less than a week gone and they doing the opposite. its not the first time it happen to Danny with the ground breaking for the new hospital. Joshau was there so it was his turned to be embarrassed by the cabal. But mr francis is representing from behind man?.Poor fellar he was not good enough to address the function last night though. So forget his statement too late. Congratulations. Keep up the good work Great Achievement. Congrats to the Government and the People of Newtown Primary catchment area. Success to all the users (teachers, students & Community). Thanks to the donor country \u2013 China. I donot support either parties I\u2019m bipartisan but this is such a good thing that the people of China gave to you all why there are not more comments? If it was negative there would not be space to put my comment. For real? September 27, 2016 It is obvious, the majority of people, who use these social networks, do not have a positively grounded mind \u2013especially the younger generation, who prefers to indulge themselves in the things of negativity and gloom, which is fed to them by those who should know better. So with subjects like this one here, they have nothing of substance to reveal, how can they write comments? I agree with you. \u201cFrancis, who was at the function but did not address it, expressed his delight on Tuesday at the opening of the facility.\u201d Was Francis sick? Why was he present and not address the function? Is it because the political machinery of Skerrit and the DLP made him was unfit to do so? \u201cI am delighted with a pleasant duty on behalf of the Roseau South Constituency, particularly Newtown and environs- to express my most sincere and profound gratitude to the Government of Dominica and the people\u2019s Republic of China for the newly constructed Newtown Primary School.\u201d Joshua you not taking shame man? Are you not an attorney? You mean to tell me they did not see you fit to be on their program as parlrep and you running with note in your pocket to congratulate the ones that disqualified you? Did you just do that to get under the skin of UWP? I would understand if you made that statement while addressing the audience but not after you were further embarrassed. It sure confirms your buyout. LOVE it\u2026more pictures please    Very nice building but the color is too close to some funeral homes I see in the USA. While it was very nice to see Mr. Joshua Francis expressed his delight at the official opening of the newly constructed Newtown Primary School, and to see him take time to give kudos to the government for a job well done, I must say that I am profoundly disappointed with the politics seen in the opening. First, Mr. Francis is the parlrep and I firmly believe that pressure from him and the UWP played a significant role in getting the school as one would clearly remember former parlrep Ambrose George saying that the money was for a School in Thibaud. As parlrep, why was Mr. Francis not on the agenda to at least make that statement? Why was his presence not recognized? Francis had to go through a back door to express his gratitude to the government for the building, but said absolutely nothing about the role of the UWP in making it a reality. It is just bad politics all around. Welcomed improvement to my alma mater\u2026thanks to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Government of Dominica. Hope present and future students, parents and teachers make the best of this facility! \u201cThe new three-storey high school\u2026\u201d \u2026.I was a little confused there, but I understand it\u2019s three storeys tall (high) and is a primary school not a secondary school\u2026.Good news for the people of Roseau South still. Thanks to the Government of Dominica and the PR of China for their support..Much power to the young people and the rest of the community. For the past few years I keep observing much of the capital investment construction projects in DA come from Grant funding (EU and other friendly Governments) yet the State\u2019s money doesn\u2019t seem to be making significant impact in other areas..Taxes and prices remain high..just an observation.. The new three-storey high school also includes an elevator to provide access for physically challenged students. High school? I thought that is a primary school! \u201cThree-storey-high\u201d meaning the building has a height of three storeys\u2026. Three-storey high meaning three-storey tall. All through the article there is mention of primary school but you zero on one at the end and make yourself look like an idiot. lol It is a primary school, which is three-storey high, and not a secondary school. Hope you understand now. lol They don\u2019t understand english Bonjay, some ppl can really make themselves look stupid on DNO eh. Good thing no real names and photos are used. lol Will there be an elevator in the reconstruction Hospital ? Idiot,it is three stories HIGH! Yes Josh Shaw this is what it means three Story High. If it was secondary is the word. Hope you were not looking for something to criticize. High school is local way. The correct English word for high school is secondary school. Take note Josh Shaw. Josh Shaw, reading and comprehending are very FUNdamental! Try that next time  Very nice. The colour is a bit loud but the facility itself is great. Kudos to the Government. This was long overdue. Let\u2019s hope the students take care of the premises. Your email address will not be published.

            "text": " A Chinese contractor, 5544 Sinohydro, is now commencing a major highway project in Bolivia. The firm is starting work on the El Sillar road project, which is worth US$426 million and is expected to take nearly three years to complete. Much of the funding for the project, 85%, will be supplied by China\u2019s Eximbank. The remaining 15% of the financing required is being supplied by Bolivia itself. Running between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, the 470km route of NR 4 includes some difficult sections, particularly for the stretch between Paracti and Villa Tunari, with its sharp curves. In the past, road construction works in the area have suffered from landslides, with the loss of lives and equipment.\n\nConstructing the highway will present major challenges due to the tough terrain and the route will feature two tunnels as well as four bridges. The upgrading work will include widening the route from a single lane in either direction at present, to having two lanes in either direction. Improving the road will increase its capacity as well as safety on the road, providing economic benefits to the region."

            "text": " The detention of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was an \"downright political incident concocted by the United States\", Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday as reported by CGTN. Zhao added that the US's \"real intention\" was to block development of the high technology sector in China, the report said.   He also slammed Canada for being an \"accomplice\" to Washington after arresting Meng at Vancouver International Airport due to a US extradition request, based on claims she had violated sanctions on Iran at the time, the report read. The outspoken official made similar statements last year, where he called the Canadian government 'hypocritical and weak' for failing to address Chinese concerns on Meng's detention. The comments come just days after Canadian courts heard arguments from Meng's lawyer, Richard Peck, who said former US president Donald Trump had used Meng as a bargaining chip in the US trade war on China, citing abuse of process. Peck's argument revealed that Trump had said in a 2018 interview he would intervene if it would benefit US national interests as well as boost future trade deals with China favoured by Washington, namely ahead of Phase One talks in late 2019.   Claims from Meng's defence lawyers were invalid as Trump was no longer president, he said as cited by Canadian media. Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat and Michael Spavor, a Canadian businessman, were arrested in China just nine days after Meng was detained in Vancouver, spiking tensions amid the ongoing political row and historically-lows ties. Both China and Canada have called the respective arrests politicised and called for their detained citizens to be released.

            "text": " By Orville Williams The government of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina today signed grant agreements with the government of Antigua and Barbuda,\nworth over US$11 million, toward education and housing projects. The housing grant, geared primarily toward the\nGovernment\u2019s Affordable Housing project, is worth approximately US$11 million\nand the education grant \u2013 toward a multimedia center at the University of the\nWest Indies, Five Islands Campus \u2013 is worth US$250,000.00. Prime Minister\nGaston Browne, and Chinese Ambassador to Antigua and Barbuda, Sun Ang, signed\nthe agreements on behalf of their respective administrations. Prime Minister Browne expressed his gratitude\nto the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and highlighted the fact\nthat this type of grant is not often done at that level. \u201cI want to take the opportunity to thank the government\nand people of the People\u2019s Republic of China for yet another significant grant\n\u2013 in the region of about EC$30 million \u2013 this means that the amount they have\nprogrammed for housing for Antigua and Barbuda is US$120 million. That is\nextremely sizable, and will help us toward achieving the objective of building\nmore climate-resilient homes for the people of Antigua and Barbuda, especially\nin vulnerable communities like Point.\u201d \u201cNormally, governments don\u2019t give money for\nthat type of purpose. The fact that the People\u2019s Republic of China has carved\nout an opportunity for us to provide our people with affordable, free homes, it\nis really to their credit that they have created that type of flexibility,\u201d the\nPrime Minister stated.\u00a0  Chinese Ambassador to Antigua and Barbuda, Sun\nAng, expressed his pleasure in signing the agreements, insisting that they are\nunconditional and genuinely geared toward the development of Antigua and\nBarbuda. \u201c[It] is my honour today to have signed these\ntwo agreements on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy,\ntogether with Honorable Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda. An\nagreement on economic and technical cooperation, the government of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China will provide the government of Antigua and Barbuda with a\ngrant of 8o million Chinese Yuan \u2013 approximately US$11 million.\u201d \u201cIt is an aid [basket], devoted to affordable\nhousing and other projects that Antigua and Barbuda deems necessary, which is\nwith no precondition whatsoever \u2013 it is a genuine gift from the 1.4 billion\nChinese people, for their brothers and sisters in this country,\u201d Ambassador Sun\nexplained.  Pro-Vice Chancellor and Principal of the\nUniversity of the West Indies, Five Islands Campus, Professor Stafford Griffith,\nalso shared his delight at the grant agreement signing \u2013 recognising the\npositive impact that improvements to the multimedia center will have on the\ncampus. \u201cThis grant will enable the government of\nAntigua and Barbuda to continue to extend the support it has been giving to the\nUniversity of the West Indies Five Islands campus, to ensure that it is an\ninstitution of excellence.\u201d \u201cIt will help the literary, digital and\ntechnological resources available to students and to teachers at the campus, to\nsupport teaching and learning in the various areas of specialisations which\nstudents are pursuing at that campus,\u201d he shared.  Ambassador Sun has previously expressed that\nthe multimedia center on the campus is expected to be complete in time for the\ncommencement of the 2020/2021 academic year.  \n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n Please enter an answer in digits:   \n\n Newsco Observer is your local, regional and international news website.

            "text": " \n I have a weird thought about China and its COVID-19 vaccines. It\u2019s weird because it doesn\u2019t seem to show \u201crising in the East and falling in the West,\u201d as Xi Jinping insists. By the end of February, the US reports over 75 million doses had been administered to our population of about 330 million. China naturally doesn\u2019t provide public data \u2014 that might imply some accountability for the Communist Party \u2014 but last week indicated 52 million doses administered at the end of February, for a population of about 1.4 billion.  The PRC\u2019s internal inoculation task has always been enormous, so it\u2019s too early to criticize the per capita failing. It\u2019s not too early to wonder why the US is 23 million doses ahead. China started inoculating months earlier, dispensing with some of those annoying clinical trials. China certainly has the capacity to act urgently against COVID \u2014 it\u2019s been bragging about that for a year. It should have the production capacity. The PRC is the world\u2019s top manufacturer, including of chemicals used in pharmaceuticals. It promises two billion vaccine doses this year. While that target is nowhere in sight, it\u2019s unwise to bet against Chinese output for too long.  In fact, China may dramatically accelerate inoculation in the next few months. A goal has been floated to administer 500 million more doses in the next four months or so. It\u2019s not clear this is an official goal but, if it is, it will definitely be reached. Or at least no one will be willing to say otherwise. Regardless, it\u2019s odd the PRC can anticipate jumping to 25 million doses per week after barely eclipsing 50 million, total. It\u2019s reminiscent of Beijing not reporting COVID testing figures for months, then suddenly being able to test millions of people quickly, once there was little sign of virus spread.  Deepening the mystery: China has rushed to make deals to provide vaccines to foreigners. This is yet another area where the government declines to provide authoritative numbers, but more than 50 countries and 500 million doses seem to be involved over some timeframe.  At this point, you may wonder about timing. If China can\nsoon leap to 25 million doses per week, that\u2019s still \u201conly\u201d 550 million doses\ninto July, far short of population size. How long will foreign partners have to\nwait for the PRC to produce enough to then inoculate hundreds of millions more\nof its own citizens and send hundreds of millions of doses abroad? It\u2019s well established that\u00a0China\u2019s current vaccines are inferior to American vaccines and possibly others\u00a0(see the table here\u00a0for a summary). Their claimed\u00a0efficacy is lower, possibly due to use of\u00a0older technologies. And the data that have been\u00a0made available on development and evaluation is\u00a0less complete than for American vaccines.\u00a0 In this light, Dan Blumenthal, Linda Zhang, and I have argued there is a window for the US to mostly finish vaccinating our much smaller population, then offer our vaccines to countries that could be waiting quite a while for China\u2019s. There are potentially huge humanitarian and foreign policy gains for the US in doing so. But there\u2019s another possibility: The PRC continues to slow-play vaccination at home and prioritize exports. The argument could be that China has controlled COVID and can afford to do this strange thing. Despite frightening virus mutations, major holiday travel being largely forbidden last month, and occasional outbreaks continuing to result in spot lockdowns of entire cities.  Most important, any reasonable government should feel\ncompelled to ensure its own citizens\u2019 health before that of other countries\u2019.\nSo here\u2019s the weird thought: What if the Communist Party knows China\u2019s current\nvaccines are barely worth the vials they\u2019re kept in? The Party should have access to the efficacy data it won\u2019t let anyone else have. It\u2019s capable of fast action yet has been in no hurry at home and seems willing to ship hundreds of millions of doses overseas, at risk of angering its own people and inducing much-dreaded social instability. This makes sense if it\u2019s shipping out low-quality vaccines while waiting for high-quality vaccines to become available, perhaps even one that is foreign-developed. Of course, the evidence for this can\u2019t possibly be conclusive. But it\u2019s not like this would be China\u2019s first COVID scam. Or second. Or third.

            "text": " A gas engineer says she's proud to be breaking stereotypes after being told that she is in the wrong job because of her gender. Despite it being 2021 and not 1951, Lisa Sheppard from Cwmbran, South Wales, claims she's often told she isn't able to \"do a 'man's job'\" and that instead of working as a gas engineer she \"should be in the kitchen cleaning\". As people around the world celebrate International Women's Day 2021, it appears we've still got a long way to go before we redress the gender imbalance, but Sheppard is glad to be doing her part. The 29-year-old recently qualified as a gas engineer following a four-year apprenticeship, after deciding she needed a career change from her previous job as a dental nurse. \"When I left school I had no idea about what I wanted to do,\" she explains. \"I just knew I needed to do something practical as I couldn't be stuck in an office. \"I got into dental nursing, but it began to feel like a dead-end job and I was desperate for a career change. \"I saw the gas engineering apprenticeship online and I thought I'd apply as I had nothing to lose. \"And luckily I was offered the job.\" Read more: International Women's Day: How to call out a friend posting sexist views online Sheppard said that knowing there weren't many women in the trade didn't really phase her. \"I get on really well with guys as I can have banter with them and I always had male friends through school,\" she explains. Sheppard is the only female worker in her company and was also the only woman on the college course during her four-year apprenticeship. She says that it is such a male-dominated industry that people often don't believe her when she tells them that she is a gas engineer. \"I would say I receive comments daily about how surprised people are when I turn up to do the job,\" she explains. \"When I arrive at a tenant's property they usually tell me how they weren't expecting a woman. \"But I am trying to break the stereotypes and I think it would be amazing for more women to get involved within the trade.\" For more than 100 years, March 8 has been known as a special day for women Sheppard has received some negative comments from men who assume she isn't able to do as good a job as a male engineer, describing some as being \"stuck in the mindset that women should just be in the kitchen\". \"Sometimes they don't even need to say anything, they just look at you as if to say 'you're not going to be doing it are you?'\" she explains. \"But I have no regrets at all. I am so glad I have done it because I love it. \"And I am proud of myself for doing it for the girls.\" Read more: International Women's Day 2021: How to shop and give back today The engineer says she also gets lots of positive feedback from people impressed with her work after completing a job. \"A lot of women have also commented on how they feel more comfortable with a female in the house especially the elderly and single mothers,\" she explains. \"This is why I started my Instagram page, to help promote females getting into the trades,\" she continues. \"If more women were to get jobs within trades it would help break the stigma that these are male jobs.\" Sheppard adds that because of her job people often judge her and expect her to be a tomboy. \"I want to prove that you can do what you like and be what you like,\" she adds. \"Just because I am a gas engineer it doesn't mean I don't like typical female things. \"I love to put on a pair of heels and a dress, getting my make-up on and letting my hair down with my friends.\" Additional reporting Caters.

(\u2018IMC\u2019) in Tucson, Arizona.\u00a0 The Mineral Reserve estimate includes an ore recovery factor of 100% and\n    mining dilution of 100 mm at the top and bottom of the mineralized beds, with the grades of the elements in the adjacent lithologies. Sonora Processing\u00a0as defined in the Sonora Feasibility Study The process plant design comprises a pre-concentration stage to produce an initial concentrate prior to roasting. The concentrate is subsequently heated in a kiln, at approximately 950 degrees Celsius, in combination with re-cycled sodium sulphate (\u2018Na2SO4\u2019), which is a by-product produced from the Sonora lithium plant, to produce an intermediate lithium sulphate (\u2018Li2SO4\u2019) product. This sulphate material then undergoes hydrometallurgical treatment, filtration, cleaning, precipitation and\n    packaging, to produce a >99.5% Li2CO3\u00a0final battery grade product. \u00a0The integrated plant has been designed to initially process 1.1 Mt of ore per year, during Stage 1 of the Sonora Project, subsequently increasing to some 2.2 Mt per year at Stage 2, producing 17,500 tpa and 35,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, respectively. The plant design also includes a circuit to produce up to 30,000 tpa of K2SO4/SOP product through a series of evaporation and precipitation stages. \u00a0 Metallurgical testwork for the Sonora Feasibility Study was carried out at SGS Laboratories (\u2018SGS\u2019) in Perth, WA, and ANSTO Laboratories (\u2018ANSTO\u2019) in Sydney, NSW, Australia. The process engineering and design for the process plants and infrastructure was completed by Ausenco Pty Ltd (\u2018Ausenco\u2019).\u00a0 Following the results of the Feasibility Study, management is focused on advancing Sonora towards production to satisfy expected continuing growth in demand for lithium driven by growing sectors such as electric vehicles and energy storage.

Recent studies have shown that megaprojects often result in cost overruns, time extensions and undesired outcomes. Regardless, megaprojects are common, particularly in developing countries, as they are a trigger for social and economic development (Li et al., 2010). Since 2007, the Government of Ecuador has begun an unprecedent investment in infrastructure. Through the National Water Secretary, the government has 16 projects in agenda accounting for over $ 3 billion, with 6 projects currently under construction. These projects are considered flagship infrastructure in the endeavour to enhance the country\u00b4s productivity.The Bulubulu-Naranjal-Ca\u00f1ar project, a $406 million multi-purpose hydraulic project for irrigation and flood control, consists of over 1,000 activities and was proposed to be completed by 2015. This novel project for Ecuador, presented as a case study, represents a challenge for project management and financing. The purpose of this preliminary study is to provide an insight to megaproject management in Ecuador, and propose improvements to megaproject management through optimization of stochastic project schedules.

Chester 12\u00b0c Children arrive at Outwood Academy in Woodlands, Doncaster Millions of children are returning to the classroom for the first time since December as coronavirus restrictions in England begin to ease. Under the first phase of the Government\u2019s road map out of lockdown, visits to care homes are also resuming from Monday \u2013 under strictly controlled conditions. And the rules around meeting another household have been loosened to allow people to leave home to meet one other person outdoors for a coffee or picnic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that although it is \u201conly a small relaxation of the rules\u201d, the changes will bring \u201cjoy and relief\u201d to families after months of \u201ctough restrictions\u201d. One scientist advising the Government acknowledged it is \u201cinevitable\u201d there will be an increase in the numbers of cases as schools go back. Professor Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said a small rise in the R number \u2013 representing the reproduction rate of the virus \u2013 is less important than the absolute numbers being admitted to hospital and intensive care. Ministers believe the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccinations should break the link between case numbers and hospital admissions and deaths as more and more people are protected from the disease. Prof Semple said schools are \u201cabsolutely\u201d safe for children to return to as surveys showed that even secondary school pupils are far less likely to contract the disease or transmit it than adults. He said the main risks come from the increased contacts among adults which will inevitably follow. \u201cThe main driver is not the pupil-teacher relationship,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. \u201cWhen we talk about schools, it is the fact that the school brings adults together, whether that\u2019s teaching staff, the domestic staff, the catering staff, and it\u2019s an opportunity for mixing.\u201d He said the advice for teachers is to wear face masks, while being \u201creally careful\u201d in the common room. \u201cTheir colleagues are more of a risk to them than the children,\u201d he said. Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it it important that other lockdown restrictions remain in place for at least three weeks as schools return. \u201cWe know that reopening schools will increase transmission, but we should be able to keep the R below one \u2013 that\u2019s the key thing to stop the runaway increase of infections,\u201d he told Times Radio. \u201cThe key thing is that children themselves, and parents, don\u2019t think \u2018The schools are open, we can relax, we can mix outside of school\u2019 \u2013 in a sense, come out of lockdown around the school opening.\u201d The reopening of schools comes amid warnings by education experts that more damage was being done to pupils by keeping them at home than having them return to the classroom. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said he is looking at proposals, including a five-term academic year, a shorter summer holiday and longer school days to help pupils catch up on learning lost during the pandemic. Labour is calling for catch-up breakfast clubs before the school day starts, saying that an analysis of official data suggests children have each lost an average of 109 face-to-face school days since the first lockdown in March last year. Most secondary school age pupils should wear face coverings in class and inside school buildings, but primary age pupils should not. #BackToSchoolhttps://t.co/VU0rRyhkc8 \u2014 Department for Education (@educationgovuk) March 8, 2021 Secondary school pupils, who are likely to have their return staggered over the week to allow for mass testing, are being asked to take three voluntary Covid-19 tests on site and one at home over the first fortnight. They will then be sent home-testing kits to use twice weekly. The Department for Education (DfE) is also advising secondary school students to wear face coverings wherever social distancing cannot be maintained, including in the classroom. But primary school children are not being asked to carry out Covid-19 tests or wear face masks on their return. Some children will also return to classrooms in Northern Ireland for the first time since December. P1 to P3 pupils will return to class but are set to go back to remote learning after two weeks. First Minister Arlene Foster has expressed hope that those primary pupils will ultimately be able to remain in school. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of care home residents in England will be able to receive indoor visits from a nominated friend or relative as of this week. Visitors will be tested prior to visits, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and be asked to keep physical contact to a minimum. Hand-holding is permitted but hugs and kissing are not, to help reduce the chance of spreading the virus, the Government has said in its latest visiting guidance.

            "text": " Amazon Food has started covering various popular localities in Bengaluru through the latest expansion Amazon on Monday announced the expansion of its food delivery service \u2014 Amazon Food \u2014 across Bengaluru. The service, which was initially started in four PIN codes in the city, is now available across a total of 62 PIN codes covering localities such as Whitefield, HSR, Sarjapur, Koramangala, Indiranagar, MG Road, Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Frazer Town, Malleshwaram, Rajajinagar, and Vijayanagar, among others. The new move by the US e-commerce giant is likely to make the competition tougher for Swiggy and Zomato as both are already facing difficulties due to regular increase in fuel prices in the country. As an introductory offer, Amazon has waived off packaging fees for all customers using the Amazon Food service. The company is, however, charging a delivery fee of Rs. 19 for customers who don't have its Prime membership. The service is free for Prime members, though. Amazon said that customers in Bengaluru could choose from a wide range of 48 cuisines and dishes such as Indian, Chinese, Italian, Biryani, Burgers, and desserts from over 2,500 restaurants and cloud kitchens. The service is notably accessible for ordering food between 7am and 11pm on a daily basis. \u201cWith the expansion of Amazon Food in Bengaluru, we continue in our endeavour to offer unmatched convenience and value while being a part of their everyday lives. Amazon Food brings some of the city's top restaurants including national outlets and as well as local favourites which are popular and follow strict delivery and safety protocols,\u201d said Sameer Khetarpal, Director \u2013 Category Management, Amazon India. Amazon Food currently offers food delivery from brands such as Burger King, Taco Bell, Subway, Behrouz Biryani, Faasos, Chai Point, Freshmenu, MOJO Pizza, Punjab Grill, and Box 8. It also lists some of the popular food outlets of Bengaluru, including Adiga's, Empire, A2B, Anand Sweets, Kannan Caf\u00e9, Toscano, Toit, Burma Burma, Mamagoto, Brik Oven, Gilly's, Big Pitcher, Kapoor's Caf\u00e9, Chinita, Windmills Craftworks, and Polar Bear. Customers in any of the eligible localities can access the Amazon Food service through the Amazon India app. It is available under the Shop by Category section, though users can also find it by searching for \u201cAmazon Food\u201d in the search bar. A dedicated Food icon is also visible for customers who have entered any of the supported PIN codes in the Amazon app. However, it is important to point out that the service is not yet available through the Amazon site. Amazon Food was launched in May last year \u2014 at a time when the national lockdown was in place across India that restricted physical access for most of the citizens. However, the company hasn't provided any details showing how it performed over the last nine months of its launch. There is also no clarity on when and where the food delivery service will be expanded in the future. Are Amazonbasics TVs Good Enough to Beat Mi TVs in India?

A consultation document released in December set out how the Government proposed to do it. Sarah Laganand Sam Strangeways today summarise the 85-page proposal and look at what the changes might mean for pupils and staff. It is a plan that will see some schools close, others expand or move and a multimillion dollar capital project to build a new school fit for 300 pupils and 30 preschoolers. The public has until next Friday to comment on the Proposal for the Introduction of Parish Primary Schools, before a blueprint is drawn up for the \u201crenovating, refurbishing and/or rebuilding\u201d required. The Government proposal would see nine primary schools close, nine schools remain and one new school be built in Devonshire (see map under related media). The new system would have a single primary school in each parish except Pembroke, which would have two. The primary school changes are part of a plan to turn the public school system from three-tier to two-tier, with the abolition of middle schools \u2013 set up under a United Bermuda Party Government in the 1990s \u2013 and the introduction of \u201csignature\u201d senior schools. The changes would also include the creation of an \u201calternative education\u201d school for youngsters with behaviour and emotional problems and a relocation of the Dame Marjorie Bean Hope Academy for special needs and the K Margaret Carter Centre for adults with learning and physical disabilities. The overhaul is expected to take two to five years to implement. REASONS FOR REFORM \u2022 The need for a better curriculum. The report said the primary school curriculum is \u201cmisaligned, antiquated and has limited offerings\u201d at present. The Cambridge Primary Curriculum was brought in ten years ago by the PLP government. Llewellyn Simmons, the director of academics at the Ministry of Education, supported it in 2016. He said: \u201cWe want all of our children to reach their full potential with this curriculum \u2026\u201d Diallo Rabain, the education minister, was asked at a public meeting last week if the Cambridge curriculum would be replaced. He said that all options were on the table. \u2022 An analysis of the Cambridge Primary Checkpoint test results for the last eight years showed that annual average scores had declined. The tests, for P6 pupils, are in English, maths and science. \u2022 The report highlighted a decline in public school enrolment and birthrates as a key reason for the closure of nine schools. There are 2,074 primary school pupils in 18 primary schools \u2013 1,086 fewer than in 2002. \u2022 The cost of maintaining too many ageing and inadequate school buildings \u2013 most are more than 50 years old and seven are between 80 and 100 years old. The 2016 Score report, commissioned by the education ministry as part of an earlier reorganisation plan, found serious health and safety, and security problems. An inspection carried out by the Cabinet Office two years later found a \u201cprevalence of mould\u201d plus electrical systems not being up to standard, old plumbing, sewage back ups, poor IT infrastructure and moisture. The primary schools consultation plan did not give a figure for the total cost for the maintenance of existing schools. Mr Rabain told a public meeting last week that he did not know the cost or how much could be saved by a reduction in the number of schools. \u2022 The report said there was a need to create \u201c21st century learning environments\u201d by an increase in the space for pupils in each classroom. It referred to a recommendation in the 2016 Score report for 40 square feet per child. The report claimed: \u201cGenerous instructional space is essential for the optimum functioning of modern classroom environments.\u201d \u2022 To fulfil a 2017 election pledge by the Progressive Labour Party to phase out middle schools. The report said the promise was made because of a \u201clack of confidence in middle schools and public education more broadly\u201d. In their place it was proposed to set up \u201csignature senior schools\u201d for children aged 13 to 18, offering academic and vocational schooling and aimed at preparing them for further education or work. HOW PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE CHOSEN FOR CLOSURE OR EXPANSION \u2022 The report said primary schools were chosen for closure mostly based on the poor state of their buildings and lack of room for expansion. A \u201clocation strategy team\u201d made up of \u201cexpert professionals\u201d who work at public schools was formed and it scored all the schools in four areas \u2013 existing building conditions, land and property conditions, health and safety, and transportation. Ministry officials were asked at a public meeting last week if the team did site visits at all the primary schools. Valerie Robinson-James, the education permanent secretary, said those on the study committee included \u201cexpert professionals in building facilities\u201d who worked in the primary schools on a day-to-day basis and had intimate knowledge about their type, infrastructure and land area. \u2022 The aim was to reduce the primary schools to one per parish, apart from Pembroke, which would have two. In parishes with more than one school, the highest scoring school was chosen to stay open. \u2022 The academic performance of schools was not a factor in the selection of schools to close. The report said: \u201cIt would not have been a fair or responsible approach to select schools based on student performance, especially when we know that there is a preponderance of research to support that student achievement is impacted by so many factors that are outside of the control of the learner.\u201d \u2022 Schools with large playing fields, room for new classrooms and space to accommodate a preschool scored highest in the study. WHAT ABOUT TEACHERS? The report mentioned the \u201cpossibility of redundancies\u201d but did not give any indication of how many teachers would be affected by cutting primary schools from 18 to ten. It said some staff numbers would change through attrition, retirement or job changes. The report said: \u201cThe ministry would like to reiterate that processes regarding staffing will be fair and transparent.\u201d It added that redundancies would be covered by the collective bargaining agreements with the Bermuda Union of Teachers. The BUT said job losses had not been brought up by the ministry during regular meetings. THE PROPOSED CHANGES \u2022 Close Prospect and Elliot in Devonshire, Gilbert Institute in Paget, Northlands in Pembroke, West End in Sandys, Heron Bay and Port Royal in Southampton, as well as St David\u2019s and St George\u2019s Prep in St George\u2019s. \u2022 Renovate the remaining nine schools and build one new school in Devonshire, with all to be \u201chigh quality\u201d and of the same standard. Each would house up to 300 children plus a preschool with 30 pupils. \u2022 The new Devonshire primary school would be on the site of the K Margaret Carter Centre. \u2022 Elliot would house the alternative education school and Prospect would be made the new home for the Dame Marjorie Bean Hope Academy \u2013 which would become an \u201cexceptionalities signature school\u201d for those with special education needs \u2013 as well as the K Margaret Carter Centre for adults. \u2022 Abolish middle schools and replace them with five senior signature schools within five years, each with one or more specialist subjects. HOW STANDARDS WOULD BE IMPROVED \u2022 A better curriculum is promised, which would be \u201crigorous and relevant, with expanded offerings\u201d. Kalmar Richards, the Commissioner of Education, told a public meeting last week that the curriculum for the entire state school system needed to be \u201caligned\u201d so pupils could build on their learning throughout their school career. \u2022 National assessments for all state school pupils. \u2022 Every school would become accredited to meet \u201cinternationally-recognised standards\u201d. Mr Rabain told a public meeting that no decision had been made on which accrediting body to use. \u2022 Professional development for teachers, principals, support staff, and \u201csystem leaders\u201d to enable them to implement the new curriculum. \u2022 A shift from a disciplinary to a \u201crestorative\u201d approach to teaching \u2013 one that focused on \"relationships, inclusiveness, problem solving and positive conflict resolution and one where maintaining positive relationships between adults and children is at the heart of everything\u201c.

A commuter reads a copy of the Apple Daily newspaper on a train in Hong Kong on August 11, 2020, a day after authorities raided the newspaper's headquarters. Credit: ISAAC LAWRENCE/ AFP  Hong Kong police told the IFJ that the 61-year-old was arrested in relation to an investigation dating back to August 2020 into several top executives of Next Digital, the media group that publishes pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. Ting had served in a number of senior roles at Next Digital over 17 years until 2016. He was the executive director and chief operating officer when he resigned. He has since been released on bail but is ordered to report back to police in May. Hong Kong\u2019s national security police raided the headquarters of Apple Daily on August 10, 2020. Several top executives of the group were arrested the same day, including its founder Jimmy Lai, as well as two of Lai\u2019s sons and the chief executive officer, Cheung Kim-hung. In all, ten people detained in the August 2020 police operations were accused of \u201ccollusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\u201d and \u201cconspiracy to defraud\u201d. A staunch supporter of Hong Kong\u2019s democratic movement and critic of Beijing, Jimmy Lai is one of the highest-profile cases among a growing list of arrests under the national security law. He has been in\u00a0detention since late December 2020, with his bail applications repeatedly rejected.\u00a0 As many as 100 people have now been arrested by the Hong Kong authorities under the national security law imposed on the city by the Beijing authorities in June 2020. According to the Hong Kong police, the arrestees include 83 males and 17 females aged between 16 and 79.

Christian Zurita RonFernando Villavicencio No fue soborno sino un \u201cacuerdo entre privados\u201c y nada tiene que ver con el contrato de Toachi Pilat\u00f3n (hidroel\u00e9ctrica ubicada a 80 km de Quito), expres\u00f3 pocos d\u00edas antes de dejar el cargo (27 de abril de 2017) el expresidente Rafael Correa, en una cargada defensa de su exministro de Electricidad, Alecksey Mosquera, acusado de recibir USD 1 mill\u00f3n de Odebrecht. La imputaci\u00f3n y posterior detenci\u00f3n de Mosquera, se origin\u00f3 a partir de las delaciones de F\u00e1bio Andreani Gandolfo y Fernando Fernandes Meias Bessa, ejecutivos de la constructora procesados por cr\u00edmenes de corrupci\u00f3n en Brasil. La coartada de Rafael Correa tra\u00eda un tufo a exculpaci\u00f3n. Coincidente con la declaraci\u00f3n del propio Mosquera -el d\u00eda de su detenci\u00f3n- el primer mandatario pretend\u00eda dirigir los reflectores al plano privado. Los dos mord\u00edan el mismo discurso: no hubo coima, fue una asesor\u00eda pactada en 2011, cuando Alecksey Mosquera, ya no era ministro. Sin embargo, la oficiosidad de Correa, sembraba m\u00e1s dudas en el ambiente \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el Presidente no desment\u00eda el pago, pero s\u00ed la fecha y el motivo? Las razones est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed. Nueva informaci\u00f3n hasta ahora desconocida, desmiente las versiones de Correa y Mosquera y pone en evidencia que ese mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares, en efecto fue un soborno (\u201cpago puntual\u201c) pactado por dos acciones concretas: aprobar el financiamiento de la obra por USD 470.6 millones, con recursos provenientes del Estado ecuatoriano por medio de un fondo petrolero llamado Feiseh, el cual estaba a esa fecha bajo el control directo del presidente Rafael Correa; y, por desembolsar de forma anticipada el 30% de adelanto (down payment) USD 112 millones a favor de Odebrecht. Seg\u00fan los documentos revisados, el pedido del mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares se concret\u00f3 los primeros d\u00edas de julio de 2007, en una reuni\u00f3n en la cual estuvieron presentes: Fernando Fernandes Meias Bessa (Odebrecht), Alecksey Mosquera (ministro), y Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez (intermediario). La reuni\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 en la oficina privada de Rodr\u00edguez en la avenida Gonz\u00e1lez Su\u00e1rez en Quito, donde Mosquera pidi\u00f3 el pago del mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares. Justamente, d\u00edas antes de esta cita, Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, le hab\u00eda pedido a su amigo Fernando Fernandes, recibir al ministro Mosquera, para hacer caminar el proyecto Toachi Pilat\u00f3n que se encontraba paralizado por falta de financiamiento. Aunque Mosquera como profesional del sector el\u00e9ctrico estaba familiarizado con Odebrecht en la hidroel\u00e9ctrica San Francisco, donde trabaj\u00f3, sin embargo, no ten\u00eda acercamiento con los nuevos ejecutivos enviados a Ecuador, los primeros meses de 2007. Entonces, Rodr\u00edguez, era el puente para llegar a ellos. www.scribd.com www.scribd.com En efecto, entre Rodr\u00edguez y Fernandes exist\u00eda una larga amistad, no solo gestada en el negocio automotriz -porque le hab\u00eda vendido en el pasado camiones marca Volvo a la constructora- sino tambi\u00e9n por los placeres h\u00edpicos que compart\u00edan desde anta\u00f1o, cuando Fernandes trabaj\u00f3 para Odebrecht en Ecuador, entre mediados de los 80 y 2002. Nos contactamos con Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, quien desmiente haber servido de intermediario entre Fernandes Bessa y Alecsey Mosquera, aunque reconoce haber mantenido relaciones comerciales con el ex ejecutivo de Odebrecht, por su negocio de venta de veh\u00edculos y repuestos Volvo a la constructora. Rodr\u00edguez, niega igualmente haber asistido a reuniones en la suite de Odebrecht en el Swisotel, y aunque reconoce conocer a Mosquera, asegura que en esas fechas (julio 2007) no le invit\u00f3 ni un caf\u00e9. Seg\u00fan el empresario automotriz, Alecksey Mosquera ten\u00eda una vieja relaci\u00f3n con la gente de Odebrecht, desde cuando trabaj\u00f3 en el Conelec (Consejo Nacional de Electrificaci\u00f3n). Tras la primera reuni\u00f3n en la oficina del intermediario, Fernando Fernandes, le comunic\u00f3 al director Superintendente de Odebrecht, F\u00e1bio Gandolfo, que hab\u00eda recibido el pedido de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares del ministro de electricidad, Alexey Mosquera y Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, para aprobar la nueva estructura de financiamiento de Toachi Pilat\u00f3n, con recursos del propio gobierno. Luego se proyectaron tres o cuatro citas adicionales, realizadas en la conocida suite 156 de Odebrecht en el Swisotel de Quito, en una de las cuales particip\u00f3 F\u00e1bio Gandolfo, donde se acord\u00f3 el soborno, se precisaron los t\u00e9rminos del pago, as\u00ed como los compromisos de Alecksey Mosquera. Gandolfo pidi\u00f3 entonces autorizaci\u00f3n a su superior, Luiz Antonio Mameri (responsable de la oficia de sobornos), que aprob\u00f3 el pago del cohecho. La seguridad que ten\u00edan Gandolfo y Fernandes en la viabilidad del proyecto Toachi Pilat\u00f3n, se basaba en varios informes entregados por Mosquera de que, la aprobaci\u00f3n del financiamiento contaba con el visto bueno del presidente Rafael Correa, quien controlaba el Feiseh. Los ejecutivos brasile\u00f1os ten\u00edan claro que en un pa\u00eds peque\u00f1o como Ecuador, con el perfil del presidente Correa, era muy dif\u00edcil asignar un proyecto de 470 millones a un ministro, sin autorizaci\u00f3n del presidente. El mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares negociado desde 2007, finalmente se entreg\u00f3 en marzo de 2008. Eran los tiempos en los que los revolucionarios gritaban a todo pulm\u00f3n que \u201cson manos limpias y corazones ardientes\u201d Finalmente, el mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares se cancel\u00f3 luego de que el gobierno de Correa desembols\u00f3 el anticipo de USD 112 millones, el 5 de marzo de 2008. La transacci\u00f3n de la coima se canaliz\u00f3 por la oficina de operaciones estructuradas, manejada por Mameri. Un informe de la polic\u00eda de Andorra del 26 de abril de 2017, entregado a la fiscal\u00eda de Ecuador explic\u00f3 c\u00f3mo se dieron esos traspasos: fue desde la cuenta de la empresa offshore Klienfield en Panam\u00e1, representada por Olivio Rodrigues, en nombre del departamento de operaciones estructuradas de Odebrecht a la cuenta de la empresa Tokio Traders a nombre de Marcelo Ra\u00fal Endara, t\u00edo de Alecksey Mosquera. Las transferencias fueron el 11 de abril de 2008 por 200 mil d\u00f3lares, a la que le siguieron otras similares el 20 de mayo y 26 de junio. El 2 de septiembre de 2008 se ejecut\u00f3 la \u00faltima por 400 mil d\u00f3lares, hasta completar el mill\u00f3n. Cambio del financiamiento del Bndes al Feiseh El acuerdo entre los coludidos funcion\u00f3 al pie de la letra: el Feiseh aprob\u00f3 el millonario cr\u00e9dito gubernamental; el directorio de Hidrotoapi (empresa p\u00fablica a cargo del proyecto) adjudic\u00f3 el contrato con los nuevos t\u00e9rminos financieros; y, el desembolso del adelanto fue realizado en un tiempo r\u00e9cord. A tal punto que, en marzo de 2008 ya estaba el dinero en la cuenta de Odebrecht, esto es, siete meses antes de que se inicie formalmente la obra. Toachi Pilat\u00f3n, era el proyecto emblem\u00e1tico de Rafael Correa, en \u00e9l se hab\u00eda empe\u00f1ado desde 2005 cuando en su condici\u00f3n de ministro de Finanzas del gobierno de Alfredo Palacio, comprometi\u00f3 su palabra con Odebrecht. Ecuador necesitaba superar los apagones dec\u00eda y la energ\u00eda hidroel\u00e9ctrica era la mejor opci\u00f3n. Pero, desde entonces hasta el 2007, cuando fue ungido Presidente, la obra no caminaba por falta de dinero. En nuestra primera entrega revelamos de forma exclusiva que el acuerdo de mayo de 2005, entre Correa y ejecutivos de Odebrecht, contaba con el financiamiento del Bndes de Brasil, bajo el modelo de socio estrat\u00e9gico \u201cswiss challenge\u201c. medium.com Sin embargo, para el 2007, con los altos precios del petr\u00f3leo, la situaci\u00f3n hab\u00eda cambiado. La directriz del gobierno ya no era financiar el proyecto con recursos del Bndes, sino con fondos p\u00fablicos, es decir con los ahorros petroleros del Feiseh. Entonces se requer\u00eda modificar los t\u00e9rminos del acuerdo anterior con Odebrecht y a eso se comprometi\u00f3 Mosquera por el pago del mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares. Un trabajo que el ministro de Electricidad no pod\u00eda hacerlo solo. Pocas semanas despu\u00e9s de pactada la coima (julio de 2007) el Feiseh autoriz\u00f3 el cr\u00e9dito de USD 470.6 millones. El siguiente paso le correspond\u00eda a la empresa p\u00fablica Hidrotoapi. En efecto, en noviembre de 2007, Bayron Granda en representaci\u00f3n de Hidrotoapi inform\u00f3 a Fabio Gandolfo la decisi\u00f3n de modificar el financiamiento, a trav\u00e9s del Feiseh. El mismo d\u00eda, a trav\u00e9s de oficio CON-Q-065\u20132007, la constructora responde positivamente la propuesta modificada y se firma un acuerdo con los nuevos t\u00e9rminos, esto es, sin financiamiento del Bndes. La propuesta de modificaci\u00f3n de la estructura de financiamiento fue presentada a votaci\u00f3n del directorio por Patricio Carri\u00f3n, padre de la presidenta de la Comisi\u00f3n de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n de la Asamblea, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Carri\u00f3n. El proceso fue ejecutado bajo la directriz del Prefecto de la Provincia de Pichincha, Gustavo Baroja, alto dirigente de Alianza Pa\u00eds. Finalmente, el contrato con Odebrecht fue suscrito en diciembre de 2007, teniendo como testigo de honor a Rafael Correa. Igualmente, la fiscalizaci\u00f3n de la obra fue adjudicada por el directorio de Hidrotoapi en julio de 2008 a la empresa Caminosca, compa\u00f1\u00eda sobre la cual pesa una demanda en EEUU, por la presunta entrega de sobornos al vicepresidente Jorge Glas y al exministro de Electricidad Esteban Albornoz, actual legislador, entre otros. Contralor\u00eda declar\u00f3 ilegal financiamiento del Feiseh y entrega de adelanto Contralor\u00eda audit\u00f3 el proyecto y emiti\u00f3 dos informes, en 2008 y 2009. En sus conclusiones acus\u00f3 al directorio de Hidrotoapi de no haber declarado desierto el concurso. Adem\u00e1s, concluy\u00f3 que el contrato adjudicado no fue favorable a los intereses del Estado. La autoridad de control no solo cuestion\u00f3 el modelo contractual y el procedimiento, sino tambi\u00e9n la entrega del adelanto de USD 112.187.214 realizada \u201cincumpliendo procedimientos\u201c, por ello exigi\u00f3 la recuperaci\u00f3n de los recursos que permanecieron en manos de la contratista casi un a\u00f1o, desde el 5 de marzo de 2008 hasta febrero de 2009, sin ganar intereses. www.scribd.com El adelanto fue devuelto descontado los costos incurridos por Odebrecht (USD 13 millones) a trav\u00e9s de un cheque del Citibank por USD 98\u00b4304.740,45. El oficio de Odebrecht con el cual notifica del hecho fue remitido tambi\u00e9n a la ministra de Finanzas, Mar\u00eda Elsa Viteri y al secretario Jur\u00eddico de la Presidencia, Alexis Mera Giler. Para la Contralor\u00eda, el directorio de Hidrotoapi actu\u00f3 al margen de la ley al autorizar la entrega del adelanto el 5 de marzo de 2008, sin que exista la orden de inicio de la obra. En esencia, el gobierno de Rafael Correa acab\u00f3 fondeando a Odebrecht con USD 112 millones durante un a\u00f1o, lapso en el cual no recibi\u00f3 el pago de intereses, una p\u00e9rdida aproximada de USD 8 millones, considerando un inter\u00e9s promedio de 7% anual. En esencia, el gobierno de Rafael Correa acab\u00f3 fondeando a Odebrecht con USD 112 millones durante un a\u00f1o, lapso en el cual no recibi\u00f3 el pago de intereses, una p\u00e9rdida aproximada de USD 8 millones Odebrecht, la maldici\u00f3n que persigue a Rafael Correa En julio de 2008 estall\u00f3 en la prensa el esc\u00e1ndalo de la central hidroel\u00e9ctrica San Francisco, construida por Odebrecht y que present\u00f3 serios desperfectos estructurales. A ra\u00edz de esos hechos, Rafael Correa expuls\u00f3 del pa\u00eds a los ejecutivos de la multinacional, incluyendo a Gandolfo, Fernandes y Mameri; adem\u00e1s suspendi\u00f3 unilateralmente todos los contratos. Como efecto de esta decisi\u00f3n, Odebrecht llev\u00f3 el caso a arbitraje de la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Quito, donde el 2010 obtuvo un fallo favorable que le oblig\u00f3 al gobierno de Correa a pagar USD 5.6 millones de indemnizaci\u00f3n. En Ecuador se comenta que la sombra de Odebrecht, impuso un sello de maldici\u00f3n a la gesti\u00f3n de Rafael Correa en las \u00e1reas estrat\u00e9gicas. Un proyecto como Toachi Pilat\u00f3n, iniciado por \u00e9l en calidad de ministro en 2005 por USD 336 millones con financiamiento externo, fue modificado y adjudicado bajo su mando presidencial en 2007, por un costo de USD 470.6 millones con financiamiento interno; y, luego por su propia decisi\u00f3n unilateral termin\u00f3 el contrato en septiembre de 2008, dejando fondeada a Odebrecht con USD 112 millones de los que no pag\u00f3 intereses un a\u00f1o. Tras la ruptura contractual con Odebrecht, el proyecto fue adjudicado de forma directa a un consorcio chino-ruso, que financi\u00f3 la ejecuci\u00f3n con recursos de la seguridad social (IESS) y otra parte con un cr\u00e9dito del Eximbank de Rusia. Pero, en 2016 nuevamente la mano de Rafael Correa, orden\u00f3 suspender unilateralmente el contrato, sin que hasta la fecha, doce a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de aprobado, genere un kilovatio de energ\u00eda, aunque su cost\u00f3 a 2017 supere los USD 600 millones. Para julio de 2010, todos los impases con la poderosa contratista hab\u00edan terminado con la firma de un acuerdo de transacci\u00f3n. A partir de entonces, Odebrecht regres\u00f3 a Ecuador con nuevos contratos que superan los 3300 millones de d\u00f3lares, los que hoy est\u00e1n en escrutinio judicial. En junio pasado, la fiscal\u00eda de Ecuador firm\u00f3 un acuerdo con Odebrecht y su similar de Brasil, para la entrega de informaci\u00f3n sobre los sobornos. El fiscal Carlos Baca Mancheno, deber\u00e1 verificar si entre los expedientes recibidos constan las delaciones de Luiz Antonio Mameri, Fabio Andreani Gandolfo y Fernando Fernandes Meias Bessa, las cuales echar\u00e1n mucha luz respecto a la trama de corrupci\u00f3n Lava jato en Ecuador.

            "text": " Maputo \u2014 Chimoio (Mozambique), 8 Mar (AIM) - The Mozambican government and the main opposition party, Renamo, on Monday launched the demobilisation, disarming and reintegration (DDR) of members of the Renamo militia in the central province of Manica. To date the demobilisation of former Renamo guerrillas has only taken place in the neighbouring province of Sofala. With the expansion of DDR into Manica, it is expected that 782 members of the Renamo militia will be demobilised. The launch ceremony was held in Chiuala, in Barue district. This is an area where a major Renamo military base has been established for many years. Speaking at the ceremony, the Secretary of State for Manica, Edson Macuacua, said that DDR is a stage that will terminate in winning an effective peace for Mozambique. \"This moment will be marked indelibly in the history of the reconstruction of this country\", he said. \"The silent diplomacy of President Filipe Nyusi has very visible results, one of which we are now witnessing, as we move towards the construction of the Mozambique we all long for\". \"We as a government are prepared at all levels to guarantee the success of all phases of the DDR\", declared Macuacua. He urged community and religious leaders and other members of society to receive the demobilised Renamo fighters as brothers, and work jointly with them for the growth of the country. He promised that the demobilised fighters could count on the full support of the Mozambican state. \"This state is your state\", Macuacua said, \"and you should feel at ease in any part of the province and of the country. As from today you are leaving military life and are becoming civilians. You are leaving your guns and picking up hoes\".

They would be \"living normally, like other Mozambicans\", he added. Other fighters still in the bush \"should not be afraid, because the Sate is prepared to receive everyone in an environment of security, peace, inclusion and friendship among Mozambicans\". Renamo general secretary Andre Magibire said that this phase of the DDR will cover not only Renamo fighters, but also eight former guerrillas who have defected from the dissident Renamo Military Junta. \"This shows that the DDR is here to stay\", declared Majibire. \"It's a reality. To those covered by the demobilisation, we would like to say that, as from today, you will be working with other Mozambicans in the construction of the country. And in any situation of lack of understanding, you must find other ways of solving problems, since it's been shown that guns only bring misfortune\". \"This is the moment of effective reconciliation between Mozambicans\", he added. \"We don't want guns to solve our differences any more. Dialogue must continue to be the main strategy for the preservation of effective peace\". Under the DDR the demobilised guerrillas will benefit from the opening of bank accounts, and the provision of basic documents such as birth certificates. The DDR arose from the peace agreement signed in August 2019 between President Filipe Nyusi and Renamo leader Ossufo Momade.

            "text": "  Now that people's lives are captured in digital media, Jessica McNaughton saw a need for a way to permanently keep memories that can't be printed off.  After her father passed away, Jessica McNaughton cherished the voice messages he had left her on her home phone and the recording she had of his laughter. They comforted her as she grieved. But when her mother passed away 10 years earlier, she didn\u2019t have any of that. \u201cI can\u2019t hear her voice anymore,\u201d McNaughton said. These personal experiences with grief and seeing how much of a difference having voice recordings made in her healing journey drove the Moose Jaw resident\u00a0 to create a company called memoryKPR (pronounced memory keeper), which she co-founded with software developer Taylor Fox. memoryKPR is a digital platform that allows users to upload pictures, audio recordings, videos, letters and other written text messages. The user can choose who is all allowed to contribute elements and the finished product can be shared with others. McNaughton and Fox began developing the platform in April 2020. In the past, people would keep written journals and photo albums, McNaughton said. But now that so much of people\u2019s lives are captured in digital media, she saw a need for a way to permanently store the memories that couldn\u2019t be printed off and stored in a book. \u201cIt displays like a story on the screen, and then you can also export it to create videos and do other types of media out of it,\u201d McNaughton said, describing it as a \u201cdigital time capsule.\u201d The platform currently has around 250 active users, but with a new partnership with Eden Care Communities in the works, McNaughton hopes to see a growing number of care home residents have a way of passing on their memories to their families. The program has already been piloted with two residents\u2019 families at Prairie Springs Care Home in Saskatoon, and McNaughton said both families were thrilled with the finished product. \u201cWe had some staff that were spending one-on-one time with elders in their facilities, and so sitting down, capturing some of these elders\u2019 stories, asking them questions,\u201d she said. Alan Stephen, CEO of Eden Care Communities, said he first heard about memoryKPR when it was nothing more than an idea McNaughton pitched at a Conexus Incubator 24 Hour Startup session. He thought it was an idea his care homes could put to good use. After a successful trial run with the two residents in Prairie Springs, Stephen said he is working on a partnership with memoryKPR to see the technology brought into all of its care homes. \u201cStorytelling is an art we\u2019ve lost,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the nomadic part of our society where mom and dad may not be in the same location as their kids or their brothers and sisters, gathering those stories is so important.\u201d For the residents whose memories are giving way to dementia, Stephen said playing back their own memories to them may even help connect them back to reality in a similar way that music sometimes does. The platform has a free model that can be used for smaller memory collections like for weddings or retirement celebrations. The paid model is subscription-based and costs $7.95 per month for unlimited storage. lgiesbrecht@postmedia.com The news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.

            "text": " The death penalty runs like a sinuous thread through California politics. The issue bedeviled two governors named Brown, Pat and his son, Jerry, whose Catholic faith weighed heavily on their stewardship of the state\u2019s execution chamber. In 1986, a public outcry resulted in the recall of three Supreme Court justices who repeatedly barred the door and kept the chamber sealed shut. For decades candidates vied to out-tough one another on the issue, even if it required the skills of an acrobat, professing moral opposition to capital punishment while vowing to vigorously enforce the law and ensure that California\u2019s most heinous denizens were sent to their death. (Never mind that executions were rarer than the appearance of major comets.) Politics \nColumn: After Nancy Pelosi, who? San Francisco plays a guessing game\n The House speaker isn\u2019t going anywhere, yet. But that\u2019s not stopping her would-be successors March 3, 2021 Gradually, the politics shifted. In 2012, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Kamala Harris was elected attorney general, the state\u2019s top law enforcement officer, running as an avowed foe of capital punishment. (Even as she refused to take a stand on a ballot measure that sought to end the death penalty and replace it with life in prison without parole.) Nothing, however, underscores the political sea change so much as Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s current search for a new attorney general. The Democrat, who already had the chance to fill Harris\u2019 Senate seat after she became vice president, will chose the successor to Xavier Becerra if, as expected, he is confirmed this week as secretary of Health and Human Services. Newsom, who declared a moratorium on executions soon after taking office, is considering some of the state\u2019s leading death penalty critics to replace Becerra, who shares his opposition to capital punishment. If anything, support for the death penalty may be a detriment to those hankering after the appointment. \u201cThe politics have changed,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a former Democratic campaign strategist who directs the Center for the Political Future at USC. \u201cSo has the composition of the electorate.\u201d He would know. In 1990, Shrum\u2019s candidate for governor, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, lost the Democratic nomination to former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who used her strong pro-death penalty stance to bludgeon Van de Kamp, one of those who tried to square the circle by pledging to set aside his personal opposition and support capital punishment. It was a different time. In 1988, George H.W. Bush carried California for Republicans for the sixth straight presidential election. The state\u2019s center of political gravity was much closer to the middle, allowing a relative moderate like Feinstein to capture the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. It was also a different place. White voters, who are more likely to support the death penalty, made up nearly 80% of the electorate in November 1990, when Feinstein narrowly lost the governor\u2019s race to Republican Pete Wilson. In November 2020, whites were just under half of those who turned out, as Joe Biden carried the state for the eighth straight time for Democrats. Politics \nColumn: An old dog learns new tricks \u2014 confessions of the L.A. Times\u2019 newest politics columnist \n Mark Z. Barabak will look at personalities, issues and political trends on the country\u2019s leading edge. March 1, 2021 Public attitudes toward the death penalty have also changed, as crime rates have fallen and issues of racial justice moved to the fore. The disproportionate number of people of color sent to death row, the many instances of wrongly convicted individuals being freed and the horrifying prospect of some innocent person being executed have become too much for many to ignore. In 1990, nearly 8 in 10 Californians supported capital punishment, according to a Los Angeles Times Poll. By 2019, that number had declined to just over 6 in 10 in a UC Berkeley survey. When asked a different way, 62% of adults questioned by the Public Policy Institute of California said they preferred a life sentence as punishment for first-degree murder, compared to just over 3 in 10 who favored the death penalty. Even so, in the last decade, voters have twice rejected state ballot measures to end capital punishment, with 52% opposed in 2012 and 53%  voting no in 2016. To Kim Nalder, who directs the Project for an Informed Electorate at Cal State Sacramento, the outcome reflects a deep ambivalence about using the machinery of government to snuff out a human life. \u201cIf something happened to someone close to them, they would want to do whatever is necessary, including possibly killing\u201d whoever is responsible, Nalder said. (The impulse to strangle a perpetrator with their own bare hands.) At the same time, Nalder went on, there is deep concern \u201cthat the system is unjust in some way.\u201d Those twin sentiments \u2014 and the absence of any high-profile murders or crime sprees to inflame public opinion \u2014 have taken much of the edge off the death penalty issue, allowing Harris, Newsom and others to vocally oppose capital punishment without suffering grave political harm. Though Newsom\u2019s moratorium on executions is mentioned in recall petitions, it\u2019s just one in a litany of reasons critics give to short-circuit his term. Newsom says he came to his position on the death penalty as a matter of principle. In an interview before announcing the moratorium, he told The Times\u2019 Phil Willon he had done a lot of \u201csoul searching\u201d and recalled discussing the issue with his late father, a state appellate court justice and adamant death penalty foe, \u201cad nauseam.\u201d  There is no doubting, however, the turn in the political tide. In 2018, seeking reelection to the Senate and facing a challenge from the left, Feinstein revealed that she, too, had rethought her position. \u201cSeveral years ago I changed my view of the death penalty,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became crystal clear to me that the risk of unequal application is high and its effect on deterrence is low.\u201d It\u2019s hard to see any statewide candidate running and winning in today\u2019s environment by championing capital punishment, even if voters aren\u2019t ready to shut San Quentin\u2019s execution chamber once and for all.

            "text": "  Explore the topics mentioned in this article The death penalty runs like a sinuous thread through California politics. The issue bedeviled two governors named Brown, Pat and his son, Jerry, whose Catholic faith weighed heavily on their stewardship of the state's execution chamber. In 1986, a public outcry resulted in the recall of three Supreme Court justices who repeatedly barred the door and kept the chamber sealed shut. For decades candidates vied to out-tough one another on the issue, even if it required the skills of an acrobat, professing moral opposition to capital punishment while vowing to vigorously enforce the law and ensure that California's most heinous denizens were sent to their death. (Never mind that executions were rarer than the appearance of major comets.) Gradually, the politics shifted. In 2012, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Kamala Harris was elected attorney general, the state's top law enforcement officer, running as an avowed foe of capital punishment. (Even as she refused to take a stand on a ballot measure that sought to end the death penalty and replace it with life in prison without parole.) Nothing, however, underscores the political sea change so much as Gov. Gavin Newsom's current search for a new attorney general. The Democrat, who already had the chance to fill Harris' Senate seat after she became vice president, will chose the successor to Xavier Becerra if, as expected, he is confirmed this week as secretary of Health and Human Services. Newsom, who declared a moratorium on executions soon after taking office, is considering some of the state's leading death penalty critics to replace Becerra, who shares his opposition to capital punishment. If anything, support for the death penalty may be a detriment to those hankering after the appointment. \"The politics have changed,\" said Bob Shrum, a former Democratic campaign strategist who directs the Center for the Political Future at USC. \"So has the composition of the electorate.\" He would know. In 1990, Shrum's candidate for governor, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, lost the Democratic nomination to former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who used her strong pro-death penalty stance to bludgeon Van de Kamp, one of those who tried to square the circle by pledging to set aside his personal opposition and support capital punishment. It was a different time. In 1988, George H.W. Bush carried California for Republicans for the sixth straight presidential election. The state's center of political gravity was much closer to the middle, allowing a relative moderate like Feinstein to capture the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. It was also a different place. White voters, who are more likely to support the death penalty, made up nearly 80% of the electorate in November 1990, when Feinstein narrowly lost the governor's race to Republican Pete Wilson. In November 2020, whites were just under half of those who turned out, as Joe Biden carried the state for the eighth straight time for Democrats. Public attitudes toward the death penalty have also changed, as crime rates have fallen and issues of racial justice moved to the fore. The disproportionate number of people of color sent to death row, the many instances of wrongly convicted individuals being freed and the horrifying prospect of some innocent person being executed have become too much for many to ignore.

CELEC said Sopladora will fulfill about 13% of Ecuador\u2019s total need for energy while allowing the country to cut the cost of importing fossil fuels by more than $280 million per year.

We spoke to master blenders Alex Thomas and Helen Mulholland about the whiskey industry in Ireland, what makes Irish whiskey stand-out, and how more women are being welcomed into the fold. Both of these remarkable women have made real waves in this industry over the years. Alex is a master blender with 15 years of experience in her field \u2014 and the creator of The Sexton Single Malt, which became the number one selling single malt in America in less than a year. Helen, a master blender at Bushmills, was the first woman to be inducted into the Whiskey Hall of Fame. She also received a Chairman\u2019s Award for her outstanding contribution to the development of the industry. Alex recalled how, when she was starting out in the industry, she joined a team that took her on \u201clike a daughter\u201d and wanted to share their experience and knowledge with her \u2014 and said that the industry, as a whole, is \u201cvery much like a family\u201d. She continued: \u201cWe\u2019re technically competitors to each other, but there\u2019s really a family vibe about us \u2014 when we get together at whiskey festivals, we\u2019re all sharing stories; and if you\u2019re stuck, you can pick up the phone and anybody will help, regardless if they\u2019re a competitor or not.\u201d She added that there\u2019s a \u201creal love for the industry\u201d in Ireland, before adding, \u201cI think that passion comes through in our spirit. \u201cI think it\u2019s so steeped in history and storytelling, and everything that a good night out with friends and family is all about. And it\u2019s been there from the first day it was made, all those hundreds of years ago.\u201d Helen told how Irish whiskey is something \u201cspecial, unique\u201d and that \u201ccreates something for everyone.\u201d She continued: \u201cI think it provides something for every palate in a very approachable, premium way of thinking. \u201cWhenever I create whiskies, I want to create one that creates memories; that people can enjoy with their friends, their family and that is there in good times for those memories we always want to cherish and enjoy.\u201d  As for if they feel there\u2019s been more women welcomed into the industry since they started their careers, the answer is simple: yes, but the growth of the industry\u2019s played a huge part in that. Alex said: \u201cThere are more people coming into the industry now, but I think it\u2019s more to do with the opportunities available. \u201cMany years ago, the men went to work while the women looked after the household \u2014 now, we all want to be out with our own careers. \u201cIt\u2019s just inspiring to see us all, how many wonderful women have come before us and made that journey a lot easier for us. And having those opportunities, with people falling back in love with the Irish whiskey category, has really helped the likes of myself get on board with an industry that\u2019s wanting us to showcase what we can do.\u201d Helen agreed, adding that while the industry being male-dominated was \u201cthe reality for a while\u201d, it as mostly down to the \u201clack of roles\u201d. She continued: \u201cOnce you join the whiskey industry, you tend to stay \u2014 there\u2019s very little turnover, so there\u2019s very little movement in many of the roles.\u201d But, she notes, the huge growth in the whiskey industry in recent years has changed things, allowing many more people to be welcomed in. She said: \u201cThe roles are there, and it allows everybody to come in \u2014 new light coming in and new experiences, it constantly generates new ways of thinking. It\u2019s a great thing to see. \u201cThere are many more women, and there\u2019re many young men and women in the industry. It\u2019s all about craftsmanship, working in harmony, and just constantly learning. \u201cI really look forward to the next five, 10 years because I think with these huge changes \u2014 as long as the quality and heritage, and the love of Irish whiskey is maintained \u2014 it can only be good.\u201d "

            "text": " In a technology-driven world like ours, the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) sector significantly influences the development of our society. Despite the increasing demand and lucrative career opportunities in STEM, it is still a heavily male-dominated field. Delving deeper into the reasons behind this, several studies found that there is a multitude of barriers for women in STEM that prevents them from pursuing these opportunities -- starting from a lack of career advancement to facing gender-based discrimination in pay and working conditions, among others.\u00a0 However, some companies within this field are realising the importance of providing equal opportunities and are working towards making STEM more inclusive as a whole. SELISE Digital Platforms, a Swiss-owned software engineering and business consulting firm where women are equally represented and fairly compensated, is one such company.\u00a0 \u00a0 Founded in 2011, SELISE is currently operating in Switzerland, UAE, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS) awarded SELISE the BASIS Outsourcing Award 2020 for its outstanding performance in the field of Software and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) service after it rolled out 500 applications and websites in 90 countries. After successfully creating a loyal base of top European companies, SELISE has started serving a wide range of clients in Bangladesh recently, from online food delivery giant Foodpanda to large multinationals such as Berger Paints.\u00a0 \u00a0 SELISE currently employs more than 60 women in various roles around the world. In SELISE, women are given equal opportunities to pursue and thrive in their respective work fields -- be it as software engineers, product managers, or business analysts.\u00a0 \u00a0 After being asked about the role of the HR department at SELISE plays in ensuring a safe and equitable working environment for employees, Susmita Newaz, one of the HR Generalists of the organisation, replied, \"Workplace Gender Equality is a huge priority for SELISE - we try our best to make sure that the women in our workplace always feel comfortable in talking to us. Our HR Team comprises an equal number of male and female employees -- we want all of our female employees to feel confident that no matter what the issue may be, they will be heard, and changes will be implemented if they reach out to us. Apart from that, we offer 4 months of paid maternity leave, free health insurance, and have implemented a sexual-harassment policy that makes no exceptions for anyone.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Dilshad Ferdousi, a long-time employee at the organisation, agreed and added: \"I have been working in SELISE for more than 7 years and am very proud to be a part of this growing company. I must say as a working mother, I've got so much support from the office in every possible way.\" \u00a0 When asked about how working at SELISE is different from other tech firms, Deepshika Chettri, a product manager at SELISE Bhutan, replied, \"SELISE has introduced me to the tech world and it gives me immense happiness to be a part of this amazing and dynamic industry. The work environment drives me to put in more effort and provides me with an open space to envision products to build\".\u00a0 \u00a0 Adding to this, her colleague Sonam, a UX engineer, stated that SELISE has built a platform where skilled, enthusiastic, and smart people come together to complete significant tasks together, thus creating opportunities to strengthen one's skills and learn to work in teams. Focusing on the factors that make SELISE a great place to work for everyone, Tabassum Ashrafi Oishi -- who has been working as a Senior Development Manager at SELISE Bangladesh for several years -- said, \"The diverse culture, the friendly environment and all the talented people of this organisation have created such a good impression on me that I never felt discriminated against or inferior for a single moment as a woman\". \u00a0 One of the most common barriers women face in STEM workplaces is gender-based discrimination in pay and working conditions. When we asked Dechen -- a software engineer from Bhutan -- about her opinions on how SELISE managed to provide equal opportunities to all its employees in a heavily male-dominated field, she replied \"In SELISE, there is no male developer or female developer, there are just developers. Being a woman or a man has never been the reason for any failure or success: it is just you.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Another problem faced by women in STEM fields is the lack of career advancement opportunities compared to their male counterparts. Being asked if the organisation provides ample career growth opportunities for female employees, Anika Tasnim, a business manager at SELISE Bangladesh, answered: \"When it comes to learning opportunities and career growth, SELISE has always ensured there is no discrimination. Hard work and diligence are sure to pay off and no work goes unappreciated here.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 SELISE tries to create learning opportunities for their new employees, helping them adjust to a field that may not be too familiar to them. \"It was challenging to accept a job in a software field having no experience and knowledge as a business analyst. However, SELISE provided a workspace where I could learn and grow,\" said Karma, a business analyst currently working at SELISE Bhutan. Adding to this, Nusaira Hassan, who joined the organisation as a business analyst a year back, said, \"In the tech world, being a woman is seemingly intimidating but SELISE strives to create an environment where each individual can carve out a niche in her own creative way.\" \u00a0 Believing in diverse teams creating more value in STEM fields, Flurina Hammer, working as the Vice President of Financial Services of the organisation, stated: \"SELISE was from the beginning conscious about hiring and developing female talent in an industry that usually attracts more men than women. We are proud to have one of the highest female employee shares in the industry.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 To answer how diversity is maintained in this multinational company, Karla Zinreich, the Head of Technology of SELISE Europe, mentioned that SELISE supports people of all cultures, genders, and religions and allows the best ideas to grow, and being a part of this team allows her to encourage other women to join the industry and to be the change they want to see. \u00a0 In a field where women are underrepresented despite the narrow gender gap in accessing quality education, SELISE has been setting an exemplary standard that other organisations can learn from and implement.\u00a0 \u00a0 Aateeya Saabeen is currently working as a Business Analyst at SELISE Bangladesh \u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u099c\u09be\u09a4\u09bf\u09b8\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09be \u0997\u09a0\u09a8\u09c7 '\u09a6\u09c8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995 \u0987\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09c7\u09ab\u09be\u0995'-\u098f\u09b0 \u0985\u09ac\u09a6\u09be\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be \u09b8\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u099c\u09a8\u09ac\u09bf\u09a6\u09bf\u09a4\u0964 \u09aa\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09bf\u0995\u09be\u099f\u09bf\u09b0 \u09b8\u09ae\u09cd\u09aa\u09be\u09a6\u0995 \u0993 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b6\u0995 \u09a4\u09ab\u09be\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09b2 \u09b9\u09cb\u09b8\u09c7\u09a8 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09bf\u0995 \u09ae\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be \u09ac\u09bf\u09b6\u09cd\u09ac\u09c7\u09b0 \u098f\u0987 \u0985\u099e\u09cd\u099a\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u0982\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u09bf\u0995\u09a4\u09be\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0\u09c1\u09b7 \u09b9\u09bf\u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ac\u09bf\u09ac\u09c7\u099a\u09bf\u09a4\u0964 \u0986\u09ae\u09b0\u09be..."

Roosevelt Skerrit, Prime Minister of Dominica, on the inspection of the bridges and culverts of the China-aided West Coast Road Post-Erica Rehabilitation Project. Also present were all the Cabinet ministers, including Hon. Reginald Austrie, Vice Prime Minister, Hon. Francine Baron, Minister for Foreign and CARICOM Affairs and Hon. John Mclntyre, Minister for the Public Works, Water Resource Management and Port.  Prime Minister Skerrit and Ambassador Lu listened to the work report by Head of Qingdao Construction Group, who especially introduced the measures they had taken to assure quality of the project.   Prime Minister Skerrit said that the West Coast Road is very important for Dominican economic and social development. He thanked the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy for their great support on this project. He also thanked the Qingdao Construction Group, who returned Dominica and resumed work in time after the Hurricane Maria. Skerrit said the technology and equipments were advanced and worthy of trust. He stressed that China was a true friend Dominica could really rely on and China always stood with Dominica during the hard time. He reaffirmed that Dominica would always adhere to the One-China Policy and continue to support China in the international affairs. Ambassador Lu expressed deep appreciation to Prime Minister Skerrit and all Ministers who attended the Inspection and highly valued the China-aided projects. Lu said that the Qingdao Construction Group was experienced in the foreign aid projects and infrastructure technology, and the quality of the three bridges involved in this project was excellent and fully met the Dominican needs of tackling climate change. He mentioned that this project would be completed and handed over in June next year according to the plan, which would add indispensable part to the China-Dominica relations. Lu also expects that the friendship between the two countries will continue to deepen. "

            "text": " To mark International Women's Day, we asked 22 of the world's most inspirational women architects and designers to nominate another woman who should be better known for their work. Each of the prominent architects and designers was asked to select a woman\u00a0who they think deserves greater recognition. Several chose to shine a light on historic figures who did not receive full recognition in their lifetimes, with MVRDV co-founder Nathalie de Vries, Bangladeshi architect\u00a0Marina Tabassum and Neri&Hu co-founder\u00a0Rossana Hu nominating\u00a0Jadwiga Grabowska-Hawrylak,\u00a0Minnette de Silva and\u00a0Lin Huiyin respectively. \n  Others took the opportunity to draw attention to a contemporary woman or women-led team that should be better known, with Camille Walala, Tatiana Bilbao, Dorte Mandrup\u00a0and Eva Franch i Gilabert nominating Unscene Architecture, Taller Comunal, Marie-Jos\u00e9 Van Hee and V. Mitch McEwen respectively. Read on for the 22 architects and designers that deserve greater recognition: Marie-Jos\u00e9 Van HeNominated by Dorte Mandrup, Dorte Mandrup Arkitekter \"Marie-Jos\u00e9 Van Hee is a remarkably talented architect. Working primarily in her native country, Belgium, she is forging a significant mark on contemporary architecture with her attention to space, light and natural materials. \"Through her understated, authentic and poetic work, she continuously influences and inspires architects and designers alike. A timeless simplicity and weightlessness permeate throughout her designs, creating a stillness that seems almost tangible \u2013 blurring the line between art and architecture.\" Eva AlbarranNominated by Sofia Von Ellrichshausen, Pezo von Ellrichshausen \"I would like to propose Eva Albarran: a Spanish entrepreneur, living both in Paris and Madrid, who operates in the expanded, and diffuse, field of contemporary art and architecture. \"She is a solid character who has managed to solve complex productions for significant artists (such as Christian Boltaski, Felice Varini or Francis Alys). Together with her husband, they direct a refined gallery and the Solo houses program, a project that might well be read as a radical revision of the current human condition in relation to nature.\" Charlotte PerriandNominated by Es Devlin, Es Devlin\u00a0Studio \"Last weekend I went to the South Downs to try to recreate this uplifting portrait of Charlotte Perriand (above) about which her daughter said: 'That photograph of a strong woman, triumphantly embracing nature, is the perfect image of my mother. She announces the contemporary woman, emancipated and free. \"Most of us have sat on the extraordinary and now iconic furniture she made in collaboration with Le Corbusier. Most of us are unaware of her fundamental role in its design. She was a genius in the art of collaboration, especially with powerful male artists. Her practice spanned an astounding onge of genres, her work drew deeply on the forms she observed in nature throughout her rich life.\" Kenyatta McleanNominated by Harriet Harriss, dean of the Pratt Institute School of Architecture \"I'd like to nominate Kenyatta Mclean, co-founder and co-managing director of Blackspace: the black, interdisciplinary, spatial collective comprised of architects, artists, designers and planners who have asserted both the necessity and the agency of 'Black Urbanism'. \"From my perspective, her ability to co-create spatial narratives that are centred in and driven by racial justice is essential and urgent work applicable both to the US where the practice is situated, and cities worldwide, where structural racism and other forms of discrimination are embedded in the materiality and form of the architectures that surround us. \"Moreover, spatial collectives \u2013 from Matrix to Assemble \u2013 offer a much-needed antidote to the vagaries of starchitecture and the hierarchies typically found in traditional design practices. Kenyatta Mclean's visionary work reminds us all of the need to use this period of Covid-imposed introspection to re-examine how much more inclusive, equitable and impactful our industry needs to become. \"Blackspace also offers a road map and a benchmark for graduates and young practitioners who are committed to leading the changes we need to make.\" Unscene ArchitectureNominated by Camille Walala, Studio Walala \"I would like to nominate Unscene Architecture. A pair of fantastic women that I met the year before the pandemic started. The architecture design duo \u2013 founders Manijeh Verghese and Madeleine Kessler \u2013 were the co-creators of the British Pavilion for the postponed 2020 Venice Architecture Biennale. Definitely, ones to watch.\" Anupama KundooNominated by Seetal Solanki, Ma-tt-er \"A rare kind within the world of architecture. Anupama Kundoo brings people a voice, materials a voice and building a voice that is beyond her own \u2013 an egoless practice. Traits that shouldn't be so rare actually, but she's paving the way for so many and hopefully many more to come.\" Ndebele womenNominated by\u00a0Sumayya Vally, Counterspace \"In this tribe, we evoke women near and far \u2013 friends, ancestors and mythical figures \u2013 women who write, organise, imagine and build worlds into being. I chose to draw attention to the unrecognised architect genius of the Ndebele women \u2013 women who craft ritual objects and build and adorn their own homes. The calling of their names invokes the calling of millions of errant, unrecognised, other architects the world over \u2013 past, present and future. \"They are Maria Ntobela Mahlangu, Dinah Mahlangu, Johanna Mkwebani, Martina Maghlangu, Anna Msiza, Sara Mthimunye, Sara and Lisbeth, Pikinini and Sara Skosana, Anna Mahlangu, Letty Ngoma, Sarah Mguni, Martha Mtsweni Ndala, Rossinah and Esther Mahlangu.\" Jadwiga Grabowska-HawrylakNominated by Nathalie de Vries, MVRDV \"When working on our Concordia Design project in Wroclaw, Poland, I met Jadwiga Grabowska-Hawrylak, the grande dame of modern Polish architecture. Born in 1920, she brought architecture to the next level in the second half of the 20th century. In 1974, she was the first woman to receive the prestigious Honorary Award from the Association of Polish Architects. \"In a time when female Polish architects were mostly known as 'the wife of\u2026' Jadwiga had a highly successful career, she had a big part in rebuilding postwar Wroclaw, and was also known for her schools and housing. I am really impressed by her work and her amazing personality. When I met her, she was very energetic and still very much involved in architecture. With her passing in 2018, Poland lost a great architect.\" Minnette de SilvaNominated by Marina Tabassum \"The first name that comes to mind is Minnette de Silva (pictured above with Pablo Picasso), an architect ahead of her time. Less celebrated than her contemporary male counterparts. You may have read this article below, but I'm sharing the link again. This tells her story better than I can write.\" Marina WillerNominated by Margaret Calvert \"I would propose Marina Willer, although she may not fit as she's already well known. Apart from being an exceptional graphic designer and filmmaker, Marina was the first woman to be appointed a Pentagram partner. Brazilian by birth, it was at the Royal College of Art, where I was teaching at the time, that I first became aware of her amazing drive, commitment and talent as a student.\" Duygu and Begum OzturkNominated by Nelly Ben Hayoun, Nelly Ben Hayoun Studios \"I nominate Duygu and Begum Ozturk, the two sisters behind the fashion brand Harem London. Born in Istanbul, they started their all-organic fashion brand recently in Dalston, London; merging traditional techniques from Istanbul and London, bringing together their heritage and future. \"I love that they started a business together as sisters and that they are persevering in developing their beautiful collection despite the pandemic and Brexit and all the complexity this created for them. They need to be applauded for their great work.\" Lin HuiyinNominated by Rossana Hu, Neri&Hu \"Lin Huiyin was the first female architect in modern China. Lin and her partner Liang Sicheng were the pioneers in architectural heritage restoration and documentation in China during the 1930s. \"Although it was the two of them who brought China's ancient architectural treasures to light, Lin's recognition in documenting and restoring China's historic buildings has often been overshadowed by her partner, who is recognised as the 'father of modern Chinese architecture'. In addition to her architectural practice, Lin is also widely acclaimed for her literary creation.\" Mary CorseNominated by Azusa\u00a0Murakami, Studio Swine \"I would like to pick Mary Corse. She has been gaining much-deserved recognition in recent years with a solo show at the Whitney but has been arguably one of the most innovative artists to come out of the light and space movement. \"We love her material research, her ability to take industrial elements like the glass microbeads used on motorway reflective road markings and using it to make really delicate and sublime optical paintings is really inspiring.\" Yemi AwosileNominated by Morag Myerscough \"Yemi Awosile and I have known each other for quite a few years now, I was delighted on one\u00a0occasion when Yemi was commissioned to make a work for a\u00a0project I was\u00a0involved with, The Bernie Grant Centre. \"Yemi has\u00a0incredible depth with a powerful social\u00a0approach to her work.\u00a0Yemi makes work\u00a0that has\u00a0meaning, beauty, art and exquisite craft.\" Franziska Porges HoskenNominated by Jane Hall, Assemble\u00a0 \"Austrian-born, and America-based, designer Franziska Porges Hosken was pioneering in multiple respects. In 1944 she became one of the first women to receive her master's of architecture degree from Harvard's Graduate School of Design and in 1947, together with her husband James Hosken, she founded their successful eponymous furniture business Hosken. \"Despite giving up her design\u00a0practice to take care of her first child in the late 1950s, Hosken continued to create as a photographer and journalist, publishing numerous books on urbanism including The Language of Cities. \"She was also an activist for women's rights, founding the Women's International\u00a0Network and publishing reports on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), a term she is credited with coining, which affected the agenda of major health organisations including the WHO. Continuing to distribute a feminist newsletter well into her eighties, Hosken's legacy demonstrates an extraordinary commitment, undertaken over the course of a lifetime, to connect design with social activism.\" Winka DubbeldamNominated by Sonali Rastogi, Morphogenesis \"Winka Dubbeldam is an architect whose contribution I would like to acknowledge. She is the founder of the WBE firm Archi-Tectonics. She had visited our studio about 15 years back whilst working on the redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station. I also enjoyed attending one of her juries in UPenn about ten years ago, and ever since, I have been following her. \"Being in academia myself, what resonates with me is her significant influence on the emerging generation through her involvement in architectural education and design juries worldwide. Her designs are evocative and transformative, and she creates architecture that matters. \"I read somewhere that she maintains a fluid balance between energy and calm, precision and informality, experiment and comfort in her designs, studio, and life, a mantra I have been following all my life.\" Iwona BuczkowskaNominated by Farshid Moussavi, Farshid Moussavi Architecture \"Polish-born French architect Iwona Buczkowska's brilliant career is distinguished by an architectural approach opposed to any form of standardisation, thus placing the diversity of users and their agency at the core of her work. Her tireless commitment has led to the creation of works of incredible richness and inventiveness, whether for housing projects or public facilities. \"At a time when we need to question our built environment, and in particular, the housing in which we live, her work on diversification, user empowerment and inclusion seems particularly worthy of attention. As her work is under-studied, and because some of her built projects are currently under threat of demolition, I feel it is particularly important to bring to light what her work has to teach us.\" Dana Al AmiriNominated by Pallavi Dean, Roar  \"Dana Al Amiri, the co-founder of Watab Studio, is a rising star in the male-dominated Saudi construction industry. I love her minimal pared design philosophy \u2013 practicing in a region that is infamous for opulent and OTT statements. She truly represents the next generation of regional architects that are defining Saudi's design identity.\" Taller ComunalNominated by Tatiana Bilbao \"I would like to make Taller Comunal, which is led by Mariana Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Grajales and Jesica Amescua Carrera, my recommendation. Because for them, architecture is not a profession, it is a service to facilitate architecture to be produced by the people who inhabit it. That should be the future of our profession.\" Anne TyngNominated by Huang Wenjing, Open Architecture \"Anne Tyng immediately came to mind as a female architect that deserves much more recognition. Born in China in 1920 to missionary parents; a classmate of Eileen Pei and IM Pei \u2014 these two little details seem to have brought her closer to me, my being Chinese and had worked in the office that IM founded. \"Tyng was one of the first women to study architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design; the only woman to take the architectural license test in 1949. \"It is unfortunate and unfair that people often seem to be more interested in her anecdotal affair with the iconic master Louis Kahn than her great influence on his early works \u2014 the rigour of geometry and order was very much Anne Tyng's interest and contribution. She went on to be an independent architect, theorist and educator. A true pioneering woman in the field.\" V. Mitch McEwenNominated by Eva Franch i Gilabert \"Mitch is an architect, activist, dancer, rapper, entrepreneur, someone who has taken the lead on many occasions to make space for new ideas. \"We crossed paths several times throughout the last ten years; In 2011, during the Occupy Wall Street Movement, I organised an exhibition and a series of events at Storefront for Art and Architecture hosted by brilliant people; Mitch's workshop \"How to Occupy a House in America\" was one of them. \"In 2014, Mitch was one of the architects writing letters to the Mayor in the first edition in New York of the global project \"Letters to the Mayor\" asking Mayor Bill de Blasio: \"How can New York City Housing Authority really become the Pride of Our City?\" and provided some answers and ideas that still stand. \"Mitch is currently an assistant professor at Princeton University \u2013 where I am currently teaching a seminar. Her work is now on display at MoMA in New York as part of Reconstructions: Architecture and Blackness in America.\" M\u00f3nica BertolinoNominated by Sandra Barclay, Barclay & Crousse  \"M\u00f3nica Bertolino is an architect from C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, where she lives and works as part of the Studio Bertolino-Barrado founded in 1981. \"Together with Carlos Barrado they have an excellent production of projects in different scales. In their work you understand immediately the search for good qualities in habitability, their sensibility when they intervene in the landscape, and their concern for research about materiality linked to the local traditions of construction. \"I admire and think she deserves recognition especially in her academic role where she transmits her passion and enthusiasm for architecture in an unconditional way. She is devoted to this mission! \"She participates in workshops and as invited professor in different universities in the world as well as a regular professor in the National University of Cordoba and in the Catholic University of Cordoba.\" Dezeen Daily is sent every day and contains all the latest stories from Dezeen.

            "text": " Watch CBSN Live \n \nMarch 8, 2021 / 11:23 AM\n          / CBS/AP\n         MacKenzie Scott, philanthropist, author and former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has married a Seattle science teacher. Dan Jewett\u00a0made the announcement in a letter\u00a0to the website of the nonprofit organization the Giving Pledge on Saturday. Jewett said he never imagined he would be in a position to talk about giving away significant wealth during his lifetime in order to make a difference in other people's lives. He expressed gratitude \"for the exceptional privilege it will be to partner in giving away assets with the potential to do so much good when shared.\"   Jewett has been a teacher for decades and most recently taught chemistry at the private Lakeside School, where Scott's children attended. \"And now, in a stroke of happy coincidence, I am married to one of the most generous and kind people I know - and joining her in a commitment to pass on an enormous financial wealth to serve others,\" Jewett wrote. After donating $1.68 billion to 116 nonprofits, universities, community development groups and legal organizations last July, Scott asked a team of advisers to help her \"accelerate\" her 2020 giving with immediate help to those financially gutted by the pandemic. Scott went on to donate a total of $5.7 billion in 2020 by asking community leaders to help identify 512 organizations for seven- and eight-figure gifts, including food banks, human-service organizations, and racial-justice charities. She was listed as No. 2 among the 50 Americans who gave the most to charity last year, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual rankings. Bezos topped the list by donating $10 billion to launch the Bezos Earth Fund. Scott\u00a0announced\u00a0a flurry of charitable gifts in December in a post on Medium, writing that she was inspired by grassroots efforts to help people in need, such as community fridges and \"impromptu person-to-person Venmo gifts.\" Scott said she started out by looking at 6,490 organizations, and then whittled down her list to 384 organizations that have a \"high potential for impact.\"\u00a0 Many of those organizations, such as food banks, address basic needs, while others focus on what Scott called \"long-term systemic inequities that have been deepened by the crisis.\" Among the beneficiaries: \"We shared each of our gift decisions with program leaders for the first time over the phone, and welcomed them to spend the funding on whatever they believe best serves their efforts,\" she wrote. \"The responses from people who took the calls often included personal stories and tears.\" Aimee Picchi contributed to this report.

            "text": " Oct 15, 2021 Roseau, Dominica, Tuesday September 13, 2016 \u2014 As part of a phased approach to construction of the New National Hospital, HUNAN Construction Engineering Group Corporation of the People\u2019s Republic of China has begun works on the site of the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) in Goodwill. The administrative building, located on the eastern end of the PMH site is now under construction. The administrative building will serve as the work space of HUNAN Construction throughout the life of the project.  Work on the administrative building is expected to last until November, 2016. As a result, residents near the hospital as well as clients of the hospital will likely experience an increase in noise, disruptions and dust due to the construction. Therefore, all are asked to be cautious when using that section of the grounds. This is the first building to be erected on the PMH site following the ground breaking ceremony for the New National Hospital on August 08, 2016. The US$40 million New National Hospital is a grant from the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. It is part of the Government of Dominica\u2019s plan to advance the country\u2019s healthcare system in infrastructure and otherwise.   The governments of Dominica and the People\u2019s Republic of China formally established diplomatic relations in March 2004.   Your email address will not be published.

Work on this new port is expected to start by April of next year, a senior executive in Lima confirmed, after Cosco Shipping Ports filed a revised environmental impact study in October.\u201cWe can now expect government approval for February 2020, said CSP\u2019s CEO Carlos Tejada.\u201d Cosco Shipping Ports aims to start construction on the US$1.3bn first stage of its Chancay port, which will have 16m depth, by April 2020, he said, adding that the project will boost the Belt and Road initiative to foster improved transportation links between China and Peru plus the rest of West Coast South America.Various sources in Callao, the biggest port for containers along the West Coast of South America (WCSA) and main gateway to Lima and Peru, told Port Strategy that Cosco is already planning to move deep-sea services there to \u201cavoid congestion at Callao\u201d as well as \u201cto bring down costs\u201d and better serve the fast-growing fruit and vegetable exports from Peru.A manager for Inca Lines, one the biggest NVOCCs in Peru, stated that Chancay will be a massive boost for key Peruvian exports such as avocadoes (Peru is third largest exporter in the world), blueberries, guava, oranges, grapes, potatoes, seafood and fishmeal.\u201cThe main reason the Chancay project will be such a benefit to shippers is, I believe, that it will help them to drastically reduce costs for many of our important exports,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cThis is especially the case for fruit exporters from the central regions of Peru, who have to take the long journey north to Paita and it could also become an alternative to Callao.\u201dPeru's fruit exports, subdivided into fresh, frozen, canned, and juice, make up over 50% of Peru\u2019s agricultural shipments and they grew by 9.5% during the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2018, according to Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Sayuri Bayona, adding pressure onto existing export corridors.The Inca executive added that imports from Asia, especially machinery and mining equipment, should also receive cost reductions and better transport logistics with the development.One Lima based shipping agent, who did not wish to be identified, added that the Chinese and Peruvian governments were keen to bolster relations between the two Pacific countries, especially via infrastructure projects such as Chancay. \u201cPeru and China are forging ever closer links and Chancay is a perfect example of that,\u201d said the Lima agent. \u201cWe also think this will shake up those setting the box handling charges in Callao and it will reduce pollution in the cities of Callao and Lima if fewer trucks have battle through congested roads of Lima to get to Callao. I think Cosco might be able to move some of their services there by 2022.\u201dHe added that Cosco Shipping would probably first drag over to Chancay its Asia to WCSA service, which also includes CMA CGM, Evergreen, OOCL and Pacific International Lines (PIL).It was only in May of this year that Shanghai-based Cosco acquired a 60% stake in the port from Volcan, a Peruvian mining company that exports zinc, lead and silver. Together the two companies now intend to build the four berth US$3bn port facility some 58 km north of Lima, where it will compete with DP World Callao and AP Moeller Callao.The new environmental impact study is being modified to include a tunnel, and an increase to four terminals compared to one in the original project. The companies are advancing all relevant permitting simultaneously and don\u2019t expect delays, according to Tejada, adding: \u201cOur vision is to convert this port into a Pacific coast hub, bring cargo directly from Asia and then distribute it around the region.\u201dAs if to emphasize the importance of the Peruvian-Chinese connections, the President of Peru, Martin Vizcarra, attended the Chancy Project Official Transfer Ceremony earlier this year and extolled its virtues.Mr Vizcarra said, \u201cThe signing of the closing certificate by companies from Peru and China is a milestone. The companies from China and Peru jointly invested and developed the Chancay Project, which laid a solid foundation for Peruvian economic development, as well as trade cooperation between China and Peru. \u201cThe construction of the Port of Chancay will contribute to the regional development and we expect to develop Port of Chancay into one of the most important hub ports in South America and logistics center near the Pacific Coast, which will promote the regional trade and the trade between China and the Latin America.\u201d \n                            A new collaboration will see the Port of Santa Fe in Argentina expand its operational reach....\n                         \n                            Truckers are fighting the opening of the railroad between La Paz, Bolivia and the port of Arica in northern Chile but it seems inevitable.

Share your email for news, gossip and more Simon Cowell and Lauren Silverman have landed back in Los Angeles following their brief stay in London.  The couple spent several weeks in the capital with their seven-year-old son Eric, but have now returned to their home in California. Music mogul Simon, 61, was pictured looking a bit jet-lagged as he sat in the back of a car with Lauren as they made their way back to Malibu. He appeared to be chewing gum and had his facemask pulled down around his chin. Lauren was seen sitting next to him wearing dark sunglasses. The couple are believed to have flown out of Luton Airport on their return to the United States following their trip to London.   During their stay, Simon and Lauren were pictured having what looked like a disagreement during a walk with their son Eric and a dog.   They both cross, but a source close to the couple told The Sun : \"Simon and Lauren weren't having a tiff at all.  \"They are happier than ever.\" While a representative for Simon added: \"There was no row or argument whatsoever.\" Their stay in London also allowed Simon to catch up with his old friend Piers Morgan.   The pair went for a socially distanced walk together, with Good Morning Britain star Piers admitting the were constantly stopped by fans.  \"Every few minutes, people approached us for a socially-distanced selfie, or a quick chat,\" Piers recalled in his column for The Daily Mail.  \"Some were funny. 'You annoyed me so much with what you said about Meghan this morning!' an elderly lady scolded me.\" \"'You're laughing as you say that, though,' observed Simon. \"'Yes!' she chuckled. 'Piers is naughty, but I like him\u2026 apart from this morning!'\" "

            "text": " A consortium comprising local and international\ncompanies has presented the only offer to build the US$1 billion Portezuelo del\nViento hydro project in Argentina\u2019s Mendoza province. According to BNamericas, the consortium includes two Chinese investors: the China Gezhouba Group and state-owned hydropower construction company Sinohydro. They are partnered with two Mendoza-based construction companies, Ceosa and Oasa, plus Argentine power engineering and construction company Impsa. Portezuelo del Viento includes a 185-m-high dam on the Colorado River, with reservoir capacity of 1,940 hm3. The dam will protect the surrounding area from floods and help with agricultural irrigation. The powerhouse will contain three 70-MW turbine-generator units. The project will also allow transferring water to the nearby Atuel River. Provincial power company Emesa will commercialize the\nenergy produced by Portezuelo del Viento. Portezuelo del Viento\u2019s budget will be covered by the\nArgentine state under a deal struck between the previous administration of\nMauricio Macri and Mendoza authorities involving previously unfulfilled\nagreements. Mendoza officials said frequently the province will pursue legal\naction if the payments are not transferred according to schedule. Construction will involve modifying highways 145 and\n226, relocating the small town of Las Loicas and building associated\ntransmission assets. Impsa offered to hire and buy 80% locally and\nsubcontract more than 50 Mendoza small and medium-sized enterprises. Other\nlocal companies could be subcontracted throughout the process, which will\ninvolve 20,000 jobs, the company said in a release. Copyright \u00a9 2019 - 2021"

            "text": " The U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon aircraft have started flying missions in the U.S. 5th Fleet AOR (Area of Operations) carrying AGM-84D Harpoon missiles. Images just released by the naval service through the DVIDS network show sailors assigned to the \u201cFighting Tigers\u201d of Patrol Squadron 8, deployed with Commander, Task Force (CTF) 57, performing preflight checks on AGM-84 harpoon missiles carried by a P-8A of VP-8 ahead of a mission in the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations (that encompasses the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and parts of the Indian Ocean) on Jan. 15-16, 2021. While the location where the images were taken has not been disclosed, it seems quite likely that the P-8A was being serviced at its usual deployment base in Manama, Bahrain, where P-3 Orion and Poseidon aircraft supporting CTF-57 are usually based. CTF-57 is the maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft Task Force for the U.S. 5th Fleet, Naval Forces Central Command, and Combined Maritime Forces. CTF-57 aircraft conduct missions in support of maritime operations to ensure stability, security, and the free flow of commerce in the Central Command area of responsibility, which connects the Mediterranean and Pacific through the Western Indian Ocean. The AGM-84D Harpoon is an anti-ship missile that complements the Mk 54 air-launched lightweight torpedo, used for ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) mission. It\u2019s obviously not the first time the Poseidon is spotted carrying this kind of weapon, although it\u2019s the first time we see this armament on a P-8 deployed to the Persian Gulf area. 0124Z#USN \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 P-8A Poseidon #ISR #ASW #ASuW\nOver Persian Gulf.#AE6823 pic.twitter.com/v6Bmz1foYI \u2014 Aleph \u05d0 \u2615 (@no_itsmyturn) February 11, 2021  We don\u2019t know where the Poseidon with its live Harpoon payload flew after the shots were taken. The P-8s are a common presence in the Persian Gulf area, where they have often been tracked by means of their Mode-S transponders. However, they also extend their patrols to the Gulf of Oman and to the Horn of Africa, where they support anti-piracy operations.

In fact, the U.S. has maintained a significant naval presence in region consistently since May 2019, as a hedge against Iran. Since then, a carrier strike group has been positioned in the Gulf round-the-clock, with few gaps in presence. At the beginning of February, USS Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group and embarked Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 164 (Reinforced), 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (with its F-35Bs) transited the Strait of Hormuz to operate in the Persian Gulf replacing USS Nimitz, after supporting Operation Octave Quartz off the coast of Somalia. P-8As are maritime patrol aircraft but even when they are not loaded with anti-ship missiles or toperdos, they carry a wide array of sensors that give the aircraft the ability to operate in the ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance) battlespace. Here\u2019s what we have already explained in a previous article here at The Aviationist: [\u2026] the P-8s are multi-mission platforms that can gather valuable intelligence using a wide array of sensors. Among these, an Advanced Airborne Sensor\u00a0(a dual-sided AESA radar that can offer 360-degree scanning on targets on land or coastal areas, and which has potential applications as a jamming or even cyberwarfare platform according to Northrop Grumman); an APY-10 multi-mode synthetic aperture radar; an MX-20 electro-optical/infrared turret for shorter-range search; and an\u00a0ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measure (ESM) suite,\u00a0able to geo-locate and track enemy radar emitters. Moreover, all sensors contribute to a single fused tactical situation display, which is then shared over both military standard and internet protocol data links, allowing for seamless delivery of information amongst U.S. and coalition forces. In that respect, the P-8A Poseidon represents a huge leap forward if compared to the P-3 Orion. For instance, the externally mounted AP/ANY-10 MTI imaging radar system (upgrade from the P-3\u2019s Littoral Surveillance Radar System \u2013 LSRS), adds both an overland and maritime MTI capability approaching the fidelity provided by the\u00a0US Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS). The significant difference with the more modern P-3s is, in particular, in the P-8\u2019s ability to rapidly exchange and share information internally among the crew and externally among joint partners.

Our transportation desk is taking shape. Two new reporters, Aria Alamalhodaei and Rebecca Bellan started Monday and have already provided some new and interesting coverage. Tamara Warren, a former editor at The Verge who has been writing about automotive and tech for two decades, reviewed the Aston Martin DBX. This week, Abigail Bassett, a World Car Juror and former CNN producer who writes about cars, tech, business \u2014 pretty much everything \u2014 break down the new VW ID. 4. We\u2019re just getting started. Vamos. Please help welcome them and follow them on Twitter and maybe even drop them a DM. You can find them @RebeccaBellan and Aria over @breadfrom.  Scooter clutter has prompted a number of entrepreneurs to start companies, all aiming to solve the problem. Tortoise has its repositioning software, and companies like Swiftmile offer docking stations that also charge scooters. But what about a solution that works across brands? Paris aims to find out. The city is testing universal charging infrastructure for electric scooters in a pilot project that will kick off in the second quarter of this year. DUCKT, which was awarded the pilot, will install 150 dock and charge points that can be plugged into bus stations and street lighting to provide the power source. DUCKT was one of 15 companies named Urban Innovation District winners. Each winner is testing a different urban project in the 13th arrondissement. The competition, which is run by Paris & Co.\u2019s urban innovation lab, includes pilots focused on food waste, rainwater collection, revegetation and waterproofing, as well as several mobility projects. Ezymob will test a mobile app that helps visually impaired people navigate public transit, Mobilypod is launching a subscription-based cargo bike service and bike shelters and the LaCroix Lab is piloting 4SafeMobilities, a system designed to streamline traffic at intersections and pedestrian crossings. Meanwhile, Porsche is taking its electrification ambitions to two wheels. The German automaker unveiled this week two electric bikes alongside the global debut of the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, the latest variant to its EV flagship. These bikes cost between $8,000 and more than $10,000 \u2014 prices one might expect from the luxury performance brand. Porsche unveils two new electric bikes alongside the Taycan Gran Turismo   Forget the \u201cdeal of the week.\u201d How about we take a stroll down memory lane and look at all the deals of 2020? CB Insights, released March 3 its State of Mobility report that looks at 2020 investment data and trends surrounding all things transportation. The upshot: The COVID-19 pandemic did help push total funding down 5% year-over-year to $27.19 billion, although CB Insights saw recovery in the second half of the year. There were 522 deals, a 21% drop from the previous year. Total funding only tells part of the story though. If 2020 will be known for anything \u2014 aside from the whole global pandemic thing \u2014 it\u2019ll be for the incredible number of SPAC deals across auto and mobility. There were 107 exits last year with 22 of them from startups going public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition, or \u201cblank check\u201d company. Having trouble gauging if that\u2019s a big deal? Here\u2019s some help: There were five auto and mobility SPACs between 2015 and 2019. Five. Electric vehicle companies and those with technology that supports EVs made up 68% of those SPAC deals in 2020. The SPAC spree isn\u2019t stopping either with Joby Aviation, Hellbiz and Otonomo just a few that have reached merger agreements and will go public in 2021. Electric vehicle tech and autonomous vehicle tech both reached peaks in 2020. EV tech companies raised $12.8 billion across 193 deals, while AVs brought in $7.3 billion across 105 deals, according to CB Insights. It\u2019s worth noting that the AV industry appears to be maturing \u2014 at least in a funding perspective \u2014 with the average deal size rising 16.8% from the previous year to $104 million. Connected car tech and auto commerce both saw dips in funding last year. For the second straight year, connected car tech saw a drop in funding and total number of deals. Funding plummeted 52% to $1 billion in 2020 compared to the previous year. CB Insights said the drop is because connectivity solutions have been widely adopted and investors have shifted their attention and money to other areas of auto tech, such as electrification and autonomy. Perhaps to no one\u2019s surprise, bike and scooter companies saw funding rise 52% year-over-year to $2.4 billion in 2020. That\u2019s still below funding seen in those heady days of 2017 and 2018 when scooters won over the hearts and minds of investors. Scooter and bike companies raked in $3.2 billion in 2017 and $4.9 billion in 2018. And finally, funding to shared mobility companies (MaaS) fell 20% in 2020 to $6.3 billion across 116 deals. Other deals that got my attention \u2026 Aero, a startup backed by Garrett Camp\u2019s startup studio Expa, raised $20 million in Series A funding round led by\u00a0Keyframe Capital, with Keyframe\u2019s chief investment officer John Rapaport joining the Aero board. Cyrus Capital Partners and Expa also participated. Luxury air travel startup Aero raises $20M  Boom Supersonic, the aerospace startup building supersonic jets, landed a strategic investment from American Express Ventures. The funds will be used for the development of the company\u2019s flagship product, the supersonic airliner Overture. Fluid Truck, a Denver-based app-based platform that lets users make short-term rentals of commercial vehicles, raised $63 million in a Series A funding round. The truck-sharing platform is aimed at mid-mile and last-mile delivery companies, which use it to remotely manage an on-demand rental fleet via web or mobile app. Private equity firm Bison Capital led the round, with participation from Ingka Investments (part of Ingka Group, the main Ikea retailer), Sumitomo Corporation of Americas and Fluid Vehicle Owners. Instacart, the on-demand grocery delivery platform, raised $265 million in funding from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others. The new funding pushed the company\u2019s valuation to $39 billion \u2014 more than double its $17.7 billion valuation when it raised $200 million just six months ago. As TechCrunch\u2019s Darrell Etherington writes: What\u2019s behind the massive increase in the value investors are willing to ascribe to the business? Put simply, the pandemic. Last year, Instacart announced three separate raises, including a $225 million round in June, followed by a $100 million round in July. The rapid sequence of venture capital injections were likely designed to fuel growth as demand for grocery delivery services surged while people attempted to quarantine or generally spend less time frequenting high-traffic social environments like grocery stores. Transportation VCs suggest frayed US-China ties will impact mobility markets  Loggi Tecnologia, the Brazilian delivery company backed by SoftBank and Microsoft Corp., raised 1.15 billion reais ($205 million) in a round led by CapSur Capital, Bloomberg reported. The company is now valued close to $2 billion. Rollick, the online powersports, RV and boat buying marketplace, raised $8.5 million in a funding round that included investors Sandbox Insurtech Ventures, TechNexus Venture Collaborative, Dallas Venture Capital, Alumni Ventures and London Technology Club. Existing investors LiveOak Venture Partners, Silverton Partners, Autotech Ventures, ManchesterStory, Anthem Venture Partners and Capital Factory also participated. Volocopter, a startup out of southern Germany that has been building and testing electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, raised \u20ac200 million (about $241 million) in a Series D round of funding. New investors include funds managed by BlackRock, global infrastructure company Atlantia SpA., Avala Capital, Tier 1 supplier Continental AG, Japan\u2019s NTT via its venture capital arm, Tokyo Century and multiple family offices. Volocopter also said that all of its existing investors \u2014 a list that includes Geely, Daimler, DB Schenker, Intel Capital, btov Partners, Team Europe and Klocke Holding and more \u2014 also contributed to the round. Alongside its aircraft, Volocopter has also been building a business case in which its vessels will be used in a taxi-style fleet in urban areas. CEO Florian Reuter told TechCrunch editor Ingrid Lunden that live services are now two years out for the two vehicle models it has been developing.  Policy: It\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner. I\u2019m trying out a new, semi-regular section in the newsletter that will cover notable legislative activity around electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, public transit and personal mobility. This week, let\u2019s head on over to California, where State Sen. Dave Min introduced a bill that would require all autonomous vehicles to also be zero emission by 2025. The bill was sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that says it doesn\u2019t want to see future means of transportation married to the technology of the past. Proponents point out the potential for AVs to either help or hurt attempts to cut emissions. While the amendment is in line with the state\u2019s goals to reduce emissions, it also adds a wrinkle to the plans of any AV developer that doesn\u2019t currently use electric vehicles. Cruise and Zoox, for instance, only use electric vehicles. AV giant Waymo and numerous others use a mix of vehicles, notably the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan. As Rebecca Bellan notes in her article, this proposed bill is in its infancy stages, so there are plenty of opportunities for it to be quashed. California bill would require all self-driving vehicles to be zero emission by 2025  The responses from the industry offered up the kind of political neutrality that aims to placate everyone. My interpretation of the various comments and statements \u2014 both on record and more informal on background chatter \u2014 is that work will soon begin to modify the language of the proposed bill to be more accommodating to the industry while hanging onto its original intent. That might mean pushing the deadline, adding hybrids and creating an exception for long-haul trucks. Meanwhile, over in the land of passenger electric vehicles, work is underway to pass laws that would allow direct sales in at least eight states.\u00a0Passage of such legislation would clear the way for EV giants like Tesla, along with newcomers Lucid and Rivian, which have yet to bring a vehicle to market, to sell directly to consumers. Tesla, Rivian and other EV entrants are working together to pass these laws. Industry alliances are not unheard of on issues in which all the parties stand to benefit. Tesla\u2019s cooperation is notable because it would end its monopoly on direct sales in some states.  Here are a few other stories that are worth sharing. Aston Martin CEO Tobias Moers\u2019 interview with Automotive News Europe is a complementary side dish to Tamara Warren\u2019s review of the DBX. The Aston Martin DBX is a tale of two vehicles  Postmates X, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion, has officially spun out as an independent company called Serve Robotics. (Y\u2019all might recall I previously reported that a deal was being shopped to investors.) Serve Robotics raised seed funding in a round led by venture capital firm Neo. Other investors included Uber as well as Lee Jacobs and Cyan Banister\u2019s Long Journey Ventures, Western Technology Investment, Scott Banister, Farhad Mohit and Postmates co-founders Bastian Lehmann and Sean Plaice. Tesla is closing its forums and launching a new social media platform called the Tesla Engagement Platform. The move has raised the ire of a community of its most ardent supporters. Tesla has closed its forums to launch a social platform and fans are not happy  Tortoise landed another deal, this time with Albertsons Companies, the grocery giant that owns Safeway and Jewel-Osco. Albertson said it has launched a pilot program that will test grocery delivery using remote-controlled delivery robots developed by Tortoise. The pilot will start at two Safeway locations in Northern California, although Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko said if successful, he expects the pilot to continue to scale to other stores in the state and possibly throughout the West Coast. Toyota Motor said it plans to sell 500 billion yen ($4.7 billion) in \u201cWoven Planet Bonds\u201d to fund a variety of renewable energy and transportation projects, including assisted mobility vehicles, and increased use of battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. Volkswagen said it plans to launch an electric sedan in 2026. The company said that the vehicle, dubbed Project Trinity, will set \u201cnew standards\u201d with its charging speed, battery range and in other technology, Car and Driver reported. Volvo Cars said it will only make and sell all-electric vehicles by 2030 as part of a broader transformation of the automaker that will include shifting sales online. The announcement was tied to the launch of the C40 Recharge, a low-slung crossover based on the company\u2019s CMA vehicle platform.

An agreement signed by both governments on Monday, outlines Chinas commitment to invest US$11 million for the construction of houses through Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s Affordable Housing Project. An additional US$250,000 has been allocated for the construction of a multimedia centre at the University of the West Indies Five Islands Campus. Prime Minister Gaston Browne, said Chinas investment in housing on the island, accelerates efforts to achieve their objective of more climate resilient homes for the people of Antigua and Barbuda. \u00a0\u201cNormally, governments don\u2019t give money for that type of purpose. The fact that the People\u2019s Republic of China has carved out an opportunity for us to provide our people with affordable, free homes, it is really to their credit that they have created that type of flexibility,\u201d he said. Chinese Ambassador to Antigua and Barbuda, Sun Ang, said the grants are meant to aid in the islands development. \u00a0Pro-Vice Chancellor and Principal of the University of the West Indies, Five Islands Campus, Professor Stafford Griffith, said the multimedia centre is a welcome addition to the resources available to students and teachers and will ensure that it is widely regarded as an institution of excellence. The multimedia centre should be completed in time for the commencement of the 2020/2021 academic year.

            "text": " Chinese auto maker BAIC is planning to begin construction of a plant in Mexico in 2020 that will start building electric and internal combustion engine vehicles in 2022. During his third visit to the country, the company\u2019s executive vice-president said BAIC believes Mexico is the best option in Latin America to open a new plant. \u201cWe receive a lot of delegations in Beijing from different states in Mexico and we talk with them about the automotive industry in Mexico and we see potential for investment,\u201d\u00a0Li Xingxing said. The state-owned company already uses a production line in a Veracruz facility operated by Mexico-based AT Motors for the final assembly of vehicles it sells in the domestic market. But because none of the actual manufacturing process is completed in Mexico, each BAIC vehicle pays a 21% import tariff. From its own Mexican factory, the company intends to sell cars locally, export to countries in South America such as Chile, Colombia and Brazil and eventually ship vehicles to the United States. Samuel Echeverr\u00eda, director of operations for BAIC in Mexico, said that eight states are vying to attract the Chinese automotive company. He explained that the firm is currently weighing its options but suggested that it could ultimately decide on a state in the Baj\u00edo region, central Mexico or the southeast of the country. The new plant is expected to generate around 2,000 jobs. Echeverr\u00eda said the exact amount that will be invested in the new plant has not yet been fixed but added that it would be less than US $2 billion, a figure that was floated by anonymous company sources earlier this year. He added that the plant would have an initial production capacity of 20,000 units a year. BAIC currently sells six models in Mexico but sales remain quite low \u2013 just 2,000 units in 2018. However, the company anticipates that domestic sales will increase to between 4,000 and 6,000 next year and for the first time it will enter Mexico\u2019s electric car market. BAIC already has 34 dealerships in Mexico and plans to open 15 more in 2019 and a further eight in 2020. The company first entered the Mexican market in 2016. The plant planned for Mexico would be BAIC\u2019s seventh outside China and its first in the Americas. Source: El Economista (sp)\u00a0 Premium content: this page is available only to subscribers.

Zach struggles with attention deficit disorder and needs to learn in person to avoid distractions that otherwise derail his studies. At the time, less than one-third of Coppell\u2019s students attended school in person. Positive coronavirus cases were low \u2014 but rising \u2014 in Texas and numbers remained low on campuses. Then, new cases among the district\u2019s oldest students started to climb. The school didn\u2019t plan to host a large homecoming event in light of the pandemic, but students gathered on their own to celebrate. Halloween brought even more social gatherings and risk. The number of new cases Coppell officials reported for the district\u2019s oldest students in the first two weeks of November was four times the number of cases in all the weeks before combined. Coppell High School and the district\u2019s ninth grade campus closed from Nov. 12 to Nov. 18. The campuses are among just 14 across Dallas County that temporarily went to all-remote learning this academic year because of a rise in COVID-19 cases, widespread exposure or staff shortages. Texas school districts largely started the academic year fully remote because the number of coronavirus cases were high in surrounding communities. But as debate over reopening engulfed the rest of the country, the state welcomed back any student who wanted to participate in on-campus learning. Some speculated schools would eventually be forced back to online learning because of the pandemic, but only those few campuses \u2014 among hundreds in the area \u2014 closed temporarily. And this number is unlikely to increase significantly before the end of the school year. An analysis by The Dallas Morning News revealed a patchwork of policies that districts use to determine when to take the dramatic step to shut down in-person learning. The majority of policies are vague and don\u2019t stipulate specific numbers that would trigger a campus closure. Officials at most districts that closed a school said the main reasons they did so was because of a widespread need to quarantine or a related staff or substitute shortage. Several districts have no written or public policy. Some, like Dallas Independent School District, delegate authority to a \u201ccore response team\u201d that reviews campuses of concern to determine the best course of action. That district closed three campuses because of the pandemic, including one before students were back on campus. Highland Park and Cedar Hill officials said they study the number of cases on campus daily to make decisions. Those districts closed zero and three schools, respectively. Some policies are ambiguously tied to public health guidance. For example, Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD spokeswoman Dawn Parnell told The News that the district follows guidelines from the county, Texas Education Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but did not specify what guidance the district followed. This district closed two schools. Garland ISD has the most detailed policy: whenever there\u2019s more than 10% of staff or students absent or there are positive COVID cases linked to campus exposure, a \u201cthorough investigation is completed,\u201d said Renee Kotsopoulos, the district\u2019s director of health services. The district developed this policy with Garland\u2019s health department. That district closed one campus. Equity issues also factor in whenever a district considers closing a campus entirely, said Roxanne Burleson, the director of the accelerated leadership program at SMU\u2019s Simmons School of Education and Human Development. \u201cIf we close down this campus and everyone has to go virtual \u2026 how do we make sure they have access to quality internet?\u201d Burleson said. Some students in low-income families don\u2019t have regular access to broadband. Educators also think about the large group of students who rely on their campus for daily meals. While many schools still offer food pickups when campuses are closed, it isn\u2019t as easy or convenient for families. Because a universal policy for schools doesn\u2019t exist, most officials likely try to balance health concerns students would face on campus with academic issues they may grapple with at home, the SMU professor said. \u201cThose issues weigh heavily on educational leaders when they\u2019re making those really tough decisions,\u201d Burleson said. Coppell ISD is one of the North Texas districts that doesn\u2019t have a specific policy. The district has only closed the district\u2019s high school and its ninth grade campus since the start of the school year. \u201cIt depends on if we can deliver instruction safely to our in-person students, meaning if there are enough teachers or substitutes to provide quality instruction to our learners,\u201d spokeswoman Amanda Simpson said. \u201cAt the time, [the] two campuses, which are our largest, were experiencing the highest number of positive cases and quarantined staff.\u201d The rising cases and limited stock of substitutes across the area ultimately forced Coppell administrators\u2019 hand, she said. The day before the high school closure was announced, the Thorn family decided to switch Zach to remote learning because of pandemic concerns. The decision wasn\u2019t without consequences, Takeitha noted. When Zach works from home, his performance suffers. Takeitha can\u2019t be home all day because of work, so it is hard for her to check on his progress. \u201cMy son was falling behind,\u201d Takeitha said. \u201cHe was failing. He wasn\u2019t turning things in.\u201d Zach worked as an at-home student for the three weeks before returning to face-to-face instruction. A meeting with campus staff revealed Zach had been marked missing from 19 classes during a period where he didn\u2019t understand attendance policies. The Thorns agreed with school staff members that Zach definitely needs to attend school in person, Takeitha noted. Education Commissioner Mike Morath believes on-campus learning is the best option for the majority of the state\u2019s students, he said recently in a legislative committee hearing. Dallas ISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa echoed this belief in January, saying that he wouldn\u2019t close down all DISD campuses unless ordered to do so by the state or his school board. \u201cUnless the governor, the commissioner, or the school board tell me we are going 100% virtual, I\u2019m proud of what we are doing,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cI think it is in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep the options open.\u201d Stay connected to the latest in education by signing up for our weekly newsletter.

(March 8)\n- Credit: Mendip Green Primary\n Students have returned to school today (Monday) marking the first steps back to normality as the Government begins its roadmap out of lockdown. Secondary school pupils will have regular Covid testing, with three tests in school before switching to twice-weekly tests\u00a0at home. Students will also wear face masks in classrooms where social distancing is not possible.\u00a0 Primary pupils will not have to take Covid tests or wear masks. Students who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a little longer. Schools have reassured parents that 'rigorous safety measures' are in place to protect staff and students.\u00a0 The Extend Learning Academies Network (ELAN) contains eight primary schools across Weston. Its spokesman has stressed how returning to school will\u00a0benefit pupils with both their education and social skills. Head of communications, Laura Elmont said: \"We are proud of all of our children, families and staff for what they have achieved over the past year. \"School provides much more than lessons and education and we are ready to welcome everyone back. \"Children have not seen their friends face-to-face in a long time and not been able to play together. Lack of social contact with your peers has a negative impact on mental health.\" ELAN comprises Bournville, Locking, Oldmixon, Mead Vale, Mendip Green, Milton Park, Walliscote and Windwhistle primary schools. More: Weekly Covid tests available for families of school and college students. Ms Elmont confirmed that 'rigorous' safety measures are in place and staff\u00a0have been taking lateral flow tests twice a week since January. She added: \"Following government advice, our schools will continue to record attendance during the national lockdown and will follow up any absences of pupils. \"We are aware that parents may have Covid-anxiety and many of our children will have been isolated for a long time. Our staff are prepared to support children on their return to school\u00a0via our recovery curriculum.\" \nWeston College will welcome students back in a 'staggered' format.\n- Credit: Weston College\n Weston College principal, Dr Paul Phillips said he was 'pleased to welcome back students' in a staggered format. Dr Phillips said: \"The college has mobilised testing centres at each of its sites and we will be inviting students in within their existing group or cohort bubbles on a phased programme. \"Once learners have completed their three tests they will be allocated a home testing kit where they will be required to complete two tests per week. Weekly testing will be in place until at least the Easter break.\" \nWeston College principal, Paul Phillips is aware that another rise in Covid-19 infections could follow if safety measures are not carried out correctly.\n- Credit: Denford Associates\n Face coverings will also be required when moving around the college to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Dr Phillips added:\u00a0\"Whilst it is encouraging to see the significant fall in the rates of infection in North Somerset, the college is acutely aware of the need to stay vigilant and maintain the health and safety measures that have been in place since the start of the academic year.\" \nThis newspaper has been a central part of community life for many years.

            "text": " Far reaching co-operation agreements signed between China and the Dominican Republic China has signed eighteen agreements with the Dominican Republic. They aim to significantly deepen economic relations through Chinese financial and other support and follow a decision by the Dominican Government taken in May this year to end its relations with Taiwan. The accords which were signed in Beijing in the presence of the Dominican President Danilo Medina included Chinese support for infrastructure construction, finance, trade and investment, agriculture, education, tourism, aviation and sports. Also agreed was a Memorandum of Cooperation within China\u2019s Economic Belt, Silk Road and Maritime Road Initiative. It was also revealed that the Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to visit the Dominican Republic. During the state visit it was announced that a US$600m loan to upgrade power distribution would be made to the Dominican energy sector by the China Export-Import Bank. Although no overall value has been placed on the level of Chinese support for the Dominican Republic, Reuters reported earlier this year that this could reach US$3.1bn though a package of investments and low interest loans (Caribbean Insight 4 May 2018). Speaking specifically about China\u2019s \u2018belt and road\u2019 initiative, President Medina said that the country was a \u201cnatural ally \u2026. as a regional centre for trade between China and the rest of the Americas.\u201d The Dominican Republic, he said, \u201csituated in the heart of Central America and the Caribbean, (it) boasts one of the region\u2019s most well-connected port networks, as well as a highly trained work force in production, transport and logistics.\u201d In a related indication of China\u2019s interest in this aspect of the future relationship, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed relating to the construction of a mega-port and power installations in Manzanillo, on the north coast of the country. Other agreements cover or include: During the visit, President Medina said that the two countries had signed a Political Consultation Agreement \u201cfocused on working together at multilateral forums\u201d. Dominican reports suggest that the signing had taken place before the visit. Speaking before the President arrived in China, the country\u2019s Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Zhang Run, said that to facilitate the development of relations, the Dominican government had established a special office to co-ordinate the development of relations. He said that in preparation for the presidential visit there had been vigorous exchanges between governments, legislative bodies, political parties, enterprises, think tanks and the media. On trade, he told the state-run Chinese News Agency, Xinhua, that\u00a0 China and the Dominican Republic were \u201ccomplementary partners\u201d. He suggested that in China, Dominican enterprises could find a large consumer market for their tobacco, rum, pineapple, banana, cacao, blue amber and other high-quality Dominican products. He also noted that several Chinese companies had either launched factories or set up offices in Santo Domingo in related to energy, telecommunications, mining and light industry. Zhang also suggested that the Dominican Republic might become a promising destination for Chinese tourists. According to the Dominican Republic\u2019s National Statistics Office (ONE) in 2017 China exported US$2.5bn there but imported just US$145m of goods of which a significant part was scrap metal. During the visit to China a Dominican Embassy in Beijing was formally opened. It was also announced that three consulates would open in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. China and the Dominican Republic officially established diplomatic relations on 1 May this year. \u00a0 This is a lead article from Caribbean Insight, The Caribbean Council\u2019s flagship fortnightly publication.

Suscribe x MercoPress, en Espa\u00f1ol Montevideo, October 15th 2021  - 21:16 UTC \u00a0 \u00a0 Argentina's government this week awarded a 4 billion dollars contract for the construction of two hydroelectric dams to a consortium led by China Gezhouba (Group) Co. and which includes Argentine firms Electroingenieria SA and Hidrocuyo SA. The hydroelectric project is expected to generate 1,740 megawatts of electricity in the sparsely populated Patagonia province of Santa Cruz, which also happens to be the political turf of President Cristina Fernandez and her late husband Nestor Kirchner. Hydroelectric dams currently account for about 30% of the power generated in Argentina The government says the dams will help curb Argentina's need to import diesel and liquefied natural gas and save some 1.1bn dollars a year. Argentina's rising energy deficit has become so significant that trouble paying for energy imports has led the government to implement a host of unpopular economic policies, including a ban on the purchase of foreign currencies, principally US dollars. The government of President Cristina Fernandez needs those dollars itself to pay for energy imports and to make payments on its foreign debt. The project's critics, however, argue the river doesn't have enough water flow to generate the full 1,740MW of power. The project's isolated location will make it expensive to transport the electricity from there to other parts of Argentina, critics say. \u201cThis project will be a huge headache for Argentina,\u201d said Gerardo Rabinovich, an energy industry consultant. \u201cIt doesn't make any sense from a technical standpoint or in terms of an investment. The country doesn't have the money to pay for this, especially when there are simpler, less expensive options available.\u201d Rabinovich said it would make much more sense to build smaller hydroelectric projects along the borders of Brazil and Paraguay where the infrastructure already exists. However Argentine President Cristina Fernandez praised the project saying it would lead to greater economic development. She also said the winning consortium initially would finance the entire project. Argentina's government first announced plans to build the dams about five years ago but repeatedly delayed the project among questions about financing. More recently, opposition politicians and critics of the government have raised questions about the transparency of the bidding process, and some have announced plans to challenge the construction contract in court. More than 20 companies, including other firms from Brazil, China, France, Korea and Spain, had participated in bidding for the hydropower projects. The dams, which will be named after two former Santa Cruz governors, including Argentine President Cristina Kirchner's late husband and predecessor in office, Nestor Kirchner, will provide power to residents and companies in Santa Cruz. Provincial officials say they hope the availability of more electricity will help attract industry to the region, though they aim to export any unused electricity to other provinces and potentially even to neighboring countries. Infrastructure Minister Julio De Vido, who has overseen the planning of the dams, said earlier this year that it will take more than five years to build them. De Vido said the dams will generate about 10% of total national demand for electricity. The energy situation is Argentine is so delicate, almost desperate, that a group of former energy secretaries has estimated that the government will have to pay around 13 billion dollars in energy imports this year to ensure the domestic market is adequately supplied. Despite recent efforts to increase oil and gas production, production of both goods has declined sharply over the past decade. At the same time, demand for energy surged during the country's economic boom, raising the need for imported energy. But new investment in energy production has been relatively scarce. Industry executives say price caps and unpredictable government policies have discouraged investment in the sector. Last year, President Kirchner said the energy import bill was so onerous she decided to seize a majority stake in oil and gas company YPF from Spain's Repsol SA in hopes of increasing energy output. The seizure has reached international courts.\n\u00a0 Why not wind power, plenty of it down there, could wind Crissie up ( mention FALKLANDS ) and she could create all the wind power needed for Santa Cruz.But seriously why not wind power, you only need turbines and heh presto, localised power. Unforetunately you would run out of names to give them, much better to call a dam after you deceased husband. what is it with Argentinians and naming things after people, must be ego I suspect.Problem with dams is the power is a long way away from the consumer.\nEl Chocon dam in Neuquen supplies power to BA 1200 kms away, how much power is lost on the way. I wonder if a little bit of that 4 billion will find its way to the Seychelles. @2 trenchtoast\n\nI wonder if ANY of that 4 billion will find it's way to the project? Most of it will end up in the Seychelles.\n\nAs for the Chinese, make sure they pay up front, and in US dollars.

            "text": " Ray McGuire has a rich resume and a political war chest to compete in the crowded New York city mayoral contest. The former Citigroup executive has raised more than $5 million since announcing his candidacy in December. But as he is polling in the single digits behind leading candidates with more name recognition, McGuire may need more than creative TV ads to break through. Some prayers may come in handy. \u201cI\u2019m taking all prayers, I need your help,\u201d McGuire told a group of twenty rabbis on a Zoom call on Friday. \u201cI would not be where I am without a whole bunch of prayers,\u201d he said at the conclusion of a 45-minute event titled Ray for the Rabbis. \u201cSo thank you in advance for whatever prayers you can send up.\u201d The virtual meeting \u2014 which included a mix of Reform, Conservative and Orthodox rabbis \u2014 is the first of its kind for any candidate in this election. \u201cI think we have got the community here who can help us at least get a little further down the journey,\u201d McGuire said. NYC mayoral candidate Ray McGuire during a Zoom call with rabbis. McGuire, 64, spoke to the group about being raised by a single mother in Dayton, Ohio, as his grandparents helped her raise him and his two brothers along with a half dozen foster children. He recounted that, while growing up, he spent many mornings walking three-quarters of a mile to get to a street corner to catch the bus that came from the Jewish part of town, traveling together to the south side to receive a good education. At age 16, following the advice from a Jewish teacher, Robin Melnick, McGuire took a Greyhound bus and traveled to New England where he enrolled at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. From there he went on to Harvard for college, law school and business school, later becoming one of the highest-ranking African American business executives on Wall Street. He recounted a recent conversation he had with the son of a Holocaust survivor, whose father was rescued during World War II by a woman who was escaping with her two daughters. They went on to live in a forest for a couple of years as they sought refuge and safety. Years later, the father recognized the family of that woman during a dinner as he overheard them recalling the story. The son, whom he didn\u2019t mention by name, is now a prominent New York businessman. McGuire said that he sees his own life story resembling the rescue story of that Holocaust survivor. \u201cWhen I think about that story, the powerful and profound journey, I think about my own story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that kind of journey that has gotten me here, certainly not with the same end of life, dire circumstances in which his father faced.\u201d He suggested that serving in a role that required managing different competing agendas had prepared him to run a complex city with diverse communities who all have different interests. \u201cI have a comfort level from praying at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, to the Cathedrals, to the churches in which I grew up, to the mosques,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cIt\u2019s not new to me. This is my life\u2019s journey.\u201d While he was short on specifics \u2013 mainly focusing on economics, management and policing \u2013 McGuire engaged the rabbinic audience. He promised the Jewish community that he would govern the way he grew up and lived in life, which is \u201crecognizing that there\u2019s beauty in each of our cultures that we need, at a minimum, to respect.\u201d Earlier on Friday, McGuire held a virtual roundtable with some 75 Jewish donors and supporters. The first-time political candidate also addressed the rise in antisemitism. McGuire pointed to the Black-Jewish coalition that was formed during the civil rights movement, suggesting those relationships have to be \u201crekindled\u201d to address the issue. \u201cIt also requires those in leadership positions to make a public stand for their lack of tolerance,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd what you should expect from me is to stand as an example of someone who has no tolerance for that.\u201d The meetings are part of an outreach effort to the Jewish community as the leading candidates are seeking to lock up support among the influential voting blocs. On Sunday, McGuire met with the leaders of the Hasidic Bobov sect, the largest Orthodox voting bloc in the Borough Park neighborhood in Brooklyn. Later this week, the Forward and the Marlene Myerson JCC of Manhattan will be co-hosting a forum for the top candidates in the election for mayor of New York. Touting his economic background and experience, McGuire echoed a verse from the Book of Esther: \u201cIf there was ever a moment and time when I need to be, and I am called to be a servant, then it is in that moment in time which is today,\u201d he told the rabbis on the Zoom call.

            "text": " Thousands of female farmers hold sit-ins and a hunger strike outside India\u2019s capital on International Women\u2019s Day against new agricultural laws. Thousands of women have joined protests by farmers on the outskirts of New Delhi to mark International Women\u2019s Day, demanding the scrapping of new agricultural laws that open up the country\u2019s vast farm sector to private buyers. The demonstrations on Monday were held at multiple sites on the capital\u2019s fringes where tens of thousands of farmers have camped for more than three months to protest against the laws, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government says are necessary to modernise agriculture. Wearing bright yellow scarves representing the colour of mustard fields, the women took centre stage at one key site, chanting slogans, holding small marches, and making speeches against the laws. \u201cThis is an important day as it represents women\u2019s strength,\u201d said Veena, a 37-year-old from a farming family, who gave only one name in order to protect her identity. \u201cI believe if us women are united, then we can achieve our target much quicker,\u201d added Veena, who travelled from the northern state of Punjab to the sprawling Tikri protest spot. More than 20,000 women gathered at the site near Delhi\u2019s border with the state of Haryana, police and event organisers said. \u201cThis is a day that will be managed and controlled by women, the speakers will be women, there will be a lot of feminist perspectives brought in, and discussions on what these laws mean for women farmers,\u201d said farm activist Kavitha Kuruganti. \u201cIt is one more occasion to showcase and highlight the contribution of women farmers both in agriculture in India as well as to this movement.\u201d About 100 women sat cross-legged in front of a makeshift stage in Ghazipur, one of the protest sites on Delhi\u2019s border with Uttar Pradesh state. Holding the flags of farm unions, they listened to female farm leaders speak and chanted slogans against the laws. At least 17 took part in a day-long hunger strike. \u201cWomen are sitting here, out in the open, in protest, but Modi doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t care about mothers, sisters, and daughters. He doesn\u2019t care about women. That\u2019s clear,\u201d said Mandeep Kaur, a female farmer who travelled 1,100km (680 miles) from Chhattisgarh state to participate in the protests. Women have been prominent at the forefront of the protests, which have posed one of the biggest challenges to Modi since he took office in 2014. Many travelled with the thousands of male farmers who arrived at the protest sites in late November and have since organised and led protest marches, run medical camps and massive soup kitchens that feed thousands, and raised demands for gender equality. \u201cToday Modi is sending wishes to women across the country on International Women\u2019s Day. Who are these women he is sending wishes to? We are also like his daughters, but he clearly doesn\u2019t care about us,\u201d said Babli Singh, a farm leader. Demonstrations were also held at Jantar Mantar, an area of New Delhi near Parliament where about 100 women held placards denouncing the new laws and calling for their withdrawal. \u201cToday we are finding ourselves under attack at all fronts. As women, as peasants, as workers, as youth and students,\u201d said women rights activist Sucharita, who uses one name. \u201cWe are opposed to the laws that have been passed in favour of corporations.\u201d Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmers have failed to end the deadlock. The farmers have rejected an offer from the government to put the laws on hold for 18 months, saying they will not settle for anything less than a complete repeal. Modi\u2019s government says the reforms will bring private investment into a vast and antiquated farm sector, improve supply chains and cut colossal waste. Agriculture accounts for nearly 15 percent of India\u2019s $2.9-trillion economy and employs about half its workforce. Women farmers have as much at stake as men from the new farm laws, Kuruganti added. \u201cMarkets that are distant as well as exploitative make single women farmers more vulnerable, and in any case, a patriarchal society has discriminated and made them vulnerable.\u201d International Women\u2019s Day, sponsored by the United Nations since 1975, celebrates women\u2019s achievements and aims to further their rights. Women often embody what agricultural experts call an \u201cinvisible workforce\u201d on India\u2019s vast farmlands. Nearly 75 percent of rural women in India who work full-time are farmers, according to the anti-poverty group Oxfam India, and the numbers are expected to rise as more men migrate to cities for jobs. Yet, less than 13 percent of women own the land they till. As protest against farm laws enters 100th day, at least 248 farmers have died on New Delhi\u2019s borders, organisers say.

            "text": " Mexico\u2019s next transportation secretary has breathed new life into the suspended Mexico City-Quer\u00e9taro train project, declaring that it forms part of the incoming government\u2019s plan for a new national railroad network. Javier Jim\u00e9nez Espri\u00fa told the newspaper El Financiero that the transportation plan also includes building a new railroad between Canc\u00fan and Palenque, modernizing the existing line between Coatzacoalcos and Salina Cruz and starting the construction of Guadalajara-Tijuana and Quer\u00e9taro-Nuevo Laredo routes. The current federal administration awarded a US $3.75-billion contract to a Chinese-led consortium in 2014 to build a high-speed rail line between Mexico City and Quer\u00e9taro but the project was later postponed as part of budget cuts announced in January 2015 and it hasn\u2019t been revived since. But following Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s landslide victory in the July 1 presidential election, it would appear that the project is back on the agenda. \u201cOur idea is to establish a national railroad network; the network has different important sections and within those we will determine which sections [deserve] the most urgent attention based on the impact they will have at both a social and economic level, because the [different] sections will trigger regional development projects,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. In a separate interview with the newspaper Milenio, Jim\u00e9nez said that the next federal government will continue practically all the infrastructure projects that have already been started but added that the development of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region in Oaxaca and the Maya area of Calakmul in Campeche would be priorities. In the former region, the future cabinet secretary said, in addition to modernizing the train line between Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, and Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, work will also be undertaken to improve the highway network. In addition, the ports in the respective cities and the airport at Ixtepec, Oaxaca, will be modernized, Jim\u00e9nez said. There are also plans to establish an extensive fiber optic network in the Isthmus region and L\u00f3pez Obrador said yesterday that the possibility of establishing a free zone with a lower value-added tax rate is also being analyzed. The projects planned for the region, which took the brunt of the powerful September 7 earthquake, will complement the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Coatzacoalcos and Salina Cruz that were established by the current government. \u201cThe other big project is the passenger train from Canc\u00fan to Bacalar and Palenque to develop the Maya area, mainly Calakmul . . .\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. He added that during its six-year term, the L\u00f3pez Obrador-led administration would prioritize the construction of paved roads in 250 municipalities that currently only have dirt-road access to their main towns. The projects will create employment in rural areas and prevent communities from being cut off due to heavy rains that can make the dirt roads impassable, Jim\u00e9nez said. He also said that by the end of the next government\u2019s term, the aim is for all Mexicans to have access to broadband internet services. With regard to the new Mexico City International Airport project, the future communications and transportation secretary said the L\u00f3pez Obrador transition team would first analyze its technical aspects\u00a0\u2014 such as the suitability of the ground it is being built on\u00a0\u2014 as well as environmental considerations to determine whether it is feasible in an operational sense. The president-elect has previously threatened to scrap the project, charging that it is too expensive, corrupt, not needed and unfeasible due to its construction on an ancient lakebed. Jim\u00e9nez said that if it is determined that the project is technically feasible, the incoming administration would turn its attention to analyzing whether\u00a0the contracts are in order and if it adds up financially. If it doesn\u2019t,\u00a0\u201cthere is the solution of the other airport,\u201d he added, referring to the proposal to adapt an existing air force base in M\u00e9xico state for commercial use. He also said the public consultation process that L\u00f3pez Obrador floated at a rally in Texcoco, M\u00e9xico state\u00a0\u2014 the municipality where the new airport is being built \u2014 would take place after the incoming government has completed its analysis. Whether the new government decides to continue with the current project or instead develop the Santa Luc\u00eda air base\u00a0\u2014 located about 50 kilometers northeast of the capital\u00a0\u2014 Jim\u00e9nez said that a new airport must be ready by 2023 to alleviate pressure on the existing facility.

            "text": " \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Peru endorsed China\u2019s BRI, leaving Colombia as the odd one out as concerns over debt, environment persist \nAndr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano June 18, 2019\n  Share Peru is the sixth Latin American country and the second largest\u00a0to join the Chinese foreign policy initiative image: Presidencia de Per\u00fa. In April, Peru announced that it will join China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), becoming the 19th country in Latin America and the Caribbean to join Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s flagship foreign policy. China\u2019s connectivity plan aims to resurrect the ancient Silk Road and maritime trade routes, as well as developing new links, and to enhance economic and political cooperation between participating countries and regions. Initially designed to incorporate Europe and Asia at its launch in 2013, the 20-fold increase in the volume of trade between China and Latin America in just a decade has meant the region is now considered \u201ca natural extension\u201d of the project. Since Panama joined in 2017, Latin America has been linked to this multibillion-dollar network of infrastructure projects that also facilitates access to new sources of financing. However, until now, the four largest economies in the region - Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia - have been reluctant to join, amid vocal US criticisms about indebtedness. The arrival of Peru \u2013 Latin America\u2019s sixth largest economy and one that has had a Free Trade Agreement with China for a decade \u2013 could boost the BRI in Andean region.\u00a0 Date signed: April 2019 What they said: \"The act of signing this memorandum of understanding is the beginning of a cooperation model that China has offered to the world that I think is interesting and that allows expanding the bonds of cooperation\" (Vice President Mercedes Ar\u00e1oz) Flagship projects: Although two years ago Peru ruled it out because of costs, President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra confirmed during his April trip to China that he is interested in reviving the interoceanic railroad with Brazil and Bolivia, which could cost up to U$60 billion. The turnaround is due in part to new studies that estimate the Peruvian part would cost US$7.500 billion, one fifth of the original quote. Vizcarra said: \"we are interested, Bolivia is even more interested, (...) but let's see, because between the two of them a third partner is missing in order to carry out the project.\" Other projects underway, which will be rebranded under the BRI, include the construction of a mega port in Chancay and another in Ilo, as well as being the second largest foreign investor in the mining sector, owning the Las Bambas copper mine in Toromocho and the Marcona iron ore mine. Concerns: \"The art of a lender is to keep a guarantee that has more value than the amount lent. The fear of borrowing countries is to fall into a hypothetical Chinese sphere \u2013 with a Chinese bank, Chinese credit, Chinese company, Chinese labour, and Chinese materials and resources \u2013 that minimises the transfer of technology and the creation of local employment\" \u2013 Patricia Castro Obando, a journalist specialising in China. President Lenin Moreno's visit to Beijing in December served to set in stone Ecuador\u2019s accession to BRI and a flurry of new investments. Yet, Ecuador is already the third largest recipient of Chinese finance in the region, just behind Venezuela and Brazil. Date signed: December 2018 What they said: \"For us, China is a benchmark for innovation and development. Currently 145 companies from this country work and invest in Ecuador, generating jobs, growth, employment and the exchange of technology and knowledge\" \u2013 President Lenin Moreno. Flagship projects: Among the new projects that were announced are the reconstruction of the Manta airport, which was hit by the 2016 earthquake, the highway between Quinind\u00e9 and Las Golondrinas (between the provinces of Esmeraldas and Imbabura) and two bridges in Canuto and Pimpiguas\u00ed (Manab\u00ed province). In practice, however, there are already a dozen projects that will now fall under the BRI umbrella, including seven hydroelectric plants (the largest of them, Coca Codo Sinclair has had many problems) and the copper mines of Panantza-San Carlos and Mirador (which have seen strong socio-environmental conflicts). Concerns: \"This close relationship has caused Ecuador to develop a dependent relationship with China and to be contemplative in the face of the socio-environmental impacts and intense conflicts caused by their companies\" \u2013 Center for Economic and Social Rights ( CEDS)    Date signed: June 2018 What they said: \"The Belt and Road Initiative and Latin America and the Caribbean\u2019s cooperation with China will play a decisive role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d \u2013 Diego Pary Rodr\u00edguez, Bolivia\u2019s foreign minister Flagship projects: Most of the projects underway with Chinese support are roads, including El Sillar (a stretch on the highway from Santa Cruz to Cochabamba), Rurrenabaque to Riberalta in the Amazon, and El Espino to Boyuibe in the Chaco, although there are also others such as the Mut\u00fan steel plant and the joint exploitation of lithium in the southern salt flats of the country. Other projects have been less fortunate. The controversial Rositas hydroelectric dam has stalled and the extension of the Santa Cruz airport has been cancelled. Concerns: \"A characteristic of the relations between China and Bolivia is the scarce information, the contradictions in the declarations of authorities and the non-disclosure of agreements and financing agreements\" \u2013 Silvia Molina and Viviana Herrera, Centre for the Study of Labour Agrarian Development (CEDLA). China, has loaned Venezuela more than US$67 billion, according to Inter-American Dialogue. Much is repaid with oil revenues. As such, China is seen as a key figure in the political crisis. Though China was a pillar of support to the Hugo Chavez government (1998-2013), it has seemingly chosen to keep channels open also with the opposition as the country slipped deeper into political and economic crisis. This position is consistent with its \u2018pragmatic\u2019 foreign policy. Self-proclaimed president Juan Carlos Guaid\u00f3 surprised a public meeting a few weeks ago when he said Chinese diplomats had assured him that \"a solution is approaching through the Contact Group\" that tries to mediate between the two. Date signed: December 2017 What they said: \u201cWe will receive billions of dollars in investment to make our joint ventures in oil fields a reality\u201d \u2013 President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Flagship projects: In the last decade China and Venezuela have agreed to push forward hundreds of projects, though progress on many is unclear. These include the La Cabrera thermoelectric plant, which currently operates at a fraction of its capacity, and the El Vig\u00eda power plant, also partially operational. Others have been a failure, such as the abandoned rice processing plant in Delta Amacuro, which was set to be the largest in Latin America. Concerns: \"Alas, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Ecuador, and Venezuela have learned the hard way, Chinese development finance often delivers a corruption-filled sugar high to the economy, followed by a nasty financial (and sometimes political) hangover.\" \u2013 Ricardo Hausmann, former minister and economic adviser to Guaid\u00f3 With Peru endorsing the BRI, Colombia remains the only Andean country on the sidelines. This is understandable when considering that, of the five countries, it has prioritised China the least in its political agenda. Under new president Iv\u00e1n Duque, Colombia focuses mainly on the political crisis in Venezuela and the US\u2019 strategy in the region. China, however, has made strong overtures: \"Colombia is an important country in Latin America that has good bilateral relations with China; a further expansion of cooperation for mutual benefit is in line with the interests of both parties and has great potential,\" Chinese ambassador Li Nianping wrote a month ago in an opinion column in national El Tiempo, in which he invited the country to join.

            "text": "  Advertisement Three hundred years ago, in 1721, England was in the grips of a smallpox epidemic. \"There were people dying all over the place,\" says Isobel Grundy, a professor emeritus of English at the University of Alberta in Canada. \"Social life came to a standstill \u2014 and all the things we've suddenly become familiar with again.\" Get the editor's top five stories of the week, and tips for navigating life \u2013 and weekends too. Sign up now. But as Londoners cowered inside their homes, there was a woman who knew how to end the outbreak. Her name was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and she had learned a technique from women in the distant Ottoman Empire that could stop the pox in its tracks. What happened next is a tale of politics and public health that bears some \"depressingly similar\" parallels to the current pandemic, Grundy says. But it also shows how science and determination turned the tide against one of the worst diseases humanity has ever endured. Smallpox was far deadlier than the coronavirus the world is currently battling. Fatality rates were as high as 30%, and many of the dead were children. Those who survived were often left scarred by the disease, which covered the body in blisters. But in the 1700s in the Ottoman Empire, centered around modern day Turkey, some women knew how to stop it. These women were part of a vast informal network of female medical professionals. \"There were a lot of women practitioners in the Ottoman Empire,\" says Akif Yerlioglu, a historian of Ottoman medicine at the University of Oslo in Norway. They were not allowed into the madrassas, Ottoman universities, but they shared knowledge among themselves, working as faith healers, midwives, surgeons and, even in one case Yerlioglu says, an eye doctor. What these women knew was this: Take a bit of pus from a smallpox patient and use a needle to scratch a tiny amount just beneath the skin so it gets into the blood of a healthy person. That person would get a mild form of smallpox and become immune to the more serious version. Yerlioglu says the practice is strikingly absent from Ottoman medical texts written by men, but accounts that do survive make clear that it was a well-known practice. \"Women were sharing this knowledge, this know-how, among themselves,\" he says. The technique was known as engrafting, variolation or, simply, inoculation. It is thought to have originated in China centuries earlier, and it was also practiced in India and Africa. \"We don't know exactly why or how it works, we just know that it does work,\" says Michael Kinch, an associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis who has written a book on vaccination. Kinch and others suspect this form of inoculation may have worked because it introduced the smallpox virus through the skin, rather than the lungs. \"By putting it in the place that is less deadly, i.e., the skin, then you would have a greater likelihood of surviving,\" he says. Another theory is that the inoculators were using a less dangerous strain of the virus. This kind of inoculation did have risks. A relatively small number of people could become very sick and even die, and patients could give others smallpox. But it was far less dangerous than catching it through normal routes. European doctors were aware of what the Ottomans and others were doing but they refused to believe it worked. At the time, \"Europe was pretty isolated and it was fairly xenophobic,\" Kinch says. Grundy says reluctance to adopt the practice was about prejudice, not science. \"It comes from an Islamic country that we regard as backwards \u2014 'How could they have the answer to smallpox?' \u2014 and also it was something done by women, which is bad.\" This was where things stood when Lady Mary arrived in the Ottoman Empire's capital of Constantinople in 1717. Lady Mary was a wealthy noblewoman, married to the English ambassador to the empire. She was enthralled by the thriving metropolis. Advertisement \"The art was completely different, the customs of life were completely different, the music, everything really,\" says Grundy, who has devoted much of her career to studying Lady Mary's writings. \"So it was all very exciting to her, and among the new discoveries she took in was this practice of inoculating against smallpox.\" Lady Mary described what she saw in a letter home to a friend. She told how old women kept pus from a smallpox victim in a nutshell and used a needle to create a tiny scratch in their patient's vein. She was instantly convinced of its potential. \"I am well satisfied of the safety of this experiment, since I intend to try it on my dear little son,\" she wrote. Lady Mary was ready to inoculate her son because smallpox had killed her brother a few years earlier, and shortly before traveling East, she had contracted it herself. \"She did survive but she was very, very badly marked. Her eyelashes never grew back after the smallpox and her skin was very much scarred,\" Grundy says. She had her son inoculated in Constantinople. The family traveled back to England. And then, in 1721, came the major smallpox outbreak in London. Lady Mary quickly arranged to have her daughter (also named Mary) inoculated. And as a member of the aristocracy, Lady Mary's decision got noticed. It was written about in the papers. \"By the time spots came up on little Mary, there was kind of a queue at the door to come and see her,\" Grundy says. \"Both social acquaintances of Lady Mary and of high-placed doctors.\" Lady Mary embraced the attention. In her letter of 1717, she had written of her desire to spread the practice of inoculation: \"I am patriot enough to take the pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in England.\" But in the next breath, she expressed contempt for British doctors, who she believed were too preoccupied with making money: \"I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly about it, if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their revenue, for the good of mankind.\" Rather than turn to the male medical establishment, Lady Mary sought to persuade the future queen of England, Caroline, the Princess of Wales, to inoculate her children. The princess, an ally of Lady Mary's, was willing to give it a try. After consulting with physicians and the king, the decision was made to conduct a series of tests \"taking criminals condemned to death and asking them to volunteer to be inoculated experimentally,\" Grundy says. Six condemned criminals were offered pardons in exchange for participating in the experiment. It was \"by today's standards, wildly unethical,\" says Kinch. There were additional tests on orphans. These kinds of experiments were commonplace for medical professionals of the time \u2014 it was medicine as practiced in a society with a rigid class structure, where slavery was still legal. \"I think there was a different view of people's lives, and of the value of life and all lives being equal,\" he says. In the end, the Princess of Wales did inoculate her daughters (her sons, possible heirs to the throne, were considered too important to risk), and Lady Mary became a public figure, which came with consequences. The princess's decision made inoculation \"a political matter,\" says Grundy. \"Those who opposed the royal family would say, 'Oh, well this is something the Princess of Wales is doing, I wouldn't trust that.' \" There were others who mistrusted its Islamic origins and some who just resisted the idea of putting a foreign contaminant in their body. For Grundy, the cultural divisions Lady Mary encountered feel very familiar. She sees parallels in today's political fights over whether to wear masks, or the racially charged conspiracy theories claiming the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab. \"The repetition of the way in which battle lines get drawn, that's really extraordinary,\" Grundy says. Kinch says Lady Mary's actions also offer lessons. \"One takeaway for everyone, whether it be scientists or nonscientists, is that we're not nearly as smart as we think we are,\" he says. \"We have much we can learn from others.\" Lady Mary wanted to stop smallpox, and to do it she was open to all ideas, he says. \"Her brilliance and her open-mindedness helped her to embrace something that helped her to save hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives.\" That's because the technique she'd borrowed from Ottoman women did take hold in England. Many thousands were inoculated, including a young boy named Edward Jenner. He went on to develop the first vaccine, also against smallpox. Vaccines proved to be safer and more effective than the old ways of inoculation. Smallpox was declared completely eradicated in 1980. And vaccination is still being used today to fight new deadly viruses, including the coronavirus. Copyright NPR 2021. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   Now, we're going to take a look back in time to a disease outbreak that took place hundreds of years ago. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of an English noblewoman who fought to end it. In doing so, she ran into some familiar problems - fear, politics and cultural division. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: For centuries, smallpox killed millions and millions of people. But in the 1700s, in a place called the Ottoman Empire, centered around modern-day Turkey, there were women who knew how to stop it. AKIF YERLIOGLU: Women were sharing this knowledge, this know-how among themselves. BRUMFIEL: Akif Yerlioglu is a historian of Ottoman medicine at the University of Oslo in Norway.

BRUMFIEL: Others worked as faith healers, midwives and surgeons. And the secret they knew was this - take a bit of pus from a smallpox victim, and use a needle to scratch a tiny amount into the blood of a healthy person. That person would get a mild form of smallpox and become immune to the more serious version. MICHAEL KINCH: We don't know exactly why or how it works, we just know that it does work.

BRUMFIEL: It wasn't risk free, but it was far less dangerous than catching smallpox. Inoculation originated in China centuries earlier and was also practiced in places like India and Africa, but not so much in Europe. Isobel Grundy, an emeritus professor at the University of Alberta in Canada, says some European doctors were aware of what the Ottomans were doing, but they refused to believe it could work. ISOBEL GRUNDY: It comes from Islamic country, which we regard as backward. How could they have the answer to smallpox? And also something done by women, which is bad.

And among the new discoveries she took in was this practice of inoculating against smallpox. BRUMFIEL: Lady Mary described what she saw in a letter home to a friend.

BRUMFIEL: She told how old women would keep pus from a smallpox victim in a nutshell, then use a needle to create a tiny scratch in their patients' vein. She was instantly convinced of its potential.

KINCH: I think there was a different view of people's lives and the value of life and all lives being equal. BRUMFIEL: In the end, the future queen did inoculate her daughters. It was a huge PR win for Lady Mary, but it also came with consequences. GRUNDY: That made it a political matter. So people who were against the royal family - oh, well, this is something that the Princess of Wales is doing. Wouldn't trust that. BRUMFIEL: There were others who mistrusted its Islamic origins. For Grundy, the things Lady Mary encountered feel very familiar in those political fights over whether to wear masks or conspiracy theories claiming the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab.

On Monday, three main roads leading south into the capital from Zouk, Jal al-Dib and al-Dawra were blocked while, in Beirut itself, protesters briefly blocked a main road in front of the central bank. In Tyre, one man tried to burn himself by pouring gasoline on his body but civil defense stopped him in time, the state news agency said. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in the crisis, bank accounts have been frozen and many have started to go hungry. After an explosion devastated whole tracts of Beirut in August, the next government resigned. But the new prime minister-designate, Saad al-Hariri, is at loggerheads with President Michel Aoun and has been unable to form a new government to carry out the reforms that would unlock billions of dollars of international aid. Since the Lebanese pound tumbled to a new low last Tuesday, protesters have been blocking roads daily. On Saturday, caretaker prime minister Hassan Diab threatened to quit to raise the pressure on those blocking the formation of a new government. Diab is meeting with President Aoun, several caretaker ministers, the central bank chief and financial and security officials on Monday, the state news agency said. Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai hit out at the politicians in his Sunday sermon: \"How can the people not revolt when the price of one dollar has surpassed 10,000 Lebanese pounds in one day, how can they not revolt when the minimum wage is $70?\" Rai has called for an U.N.-sponsored international conference to help Lebanon. \u00a9 2021 The Himalayan Times "

Rather, you have to earn it. You must become eligible to do so. That can be done only through education and skills training,\u201d she said. Hasina highlighted the different measures taken by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as well as her government to ensure that the women are empowered. Now, women are getting scholarships until their higher education, the prime minister said, adding 70 percent of the stipend from Prime Minister's Education Assistance Fund are given to women. Also, girls comprise the majority of the 20 million students receiving government scholarship. \u201cIf we want to build a great society, we must provide education to all, irrespective of their gender. \u201cWe ensured that both men and women have access to training courses. This will ensure that women\u00a0 can prove their capacity and find work.\u201d \n  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina virtually addresses a programme organised by the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs at the Shishu Academy auditorium to mark International Women's Day, Mar 8, 2021. Photo: PMO   She pointed out that no woman would be appointed to the posts of deputy commissioner, superintendent of police or Upazila Nirbahi Officer before her party's rule in 1996. Women's representation in parliament is the \u2018biggest achievement\u2019 of Bangladesh, with the current speaker, leader of the house and leader of the opposition, all being women, Hasina said. A society becomes crippled if half of its constitutents is not working, according to the Awami League chief. \u201cEarlier, women were confined to the four walls of their homes in the name of religion or society. They have overcome those obstacles now and are moving forward,\u201d she said. \n    Mia Seppo, UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, MOWCA Secretary Md Sayedul Islam and other high-ranking officials were present at the event. Quoting her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Sheikh Hasina said that Islam always upholds women\u2019s rights. She also described how Bangabandhu\u2019s wife Begum Fazilatunnesa supported him in his struggle to ensure the rights of Bangalees, and provided courage. \u201cShe never had any demand as a wife. On the contrary, my mother took all responsibilities of managing the family,\u201d she said. \u201cShe reared us and looked after the party issues of the Bangladesh Awami League and Chhatra League when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib used to be in jail. But she did all of these from behind the scene as she never wanted to be in the limelight. My mother Begum Fazilatunnesa made a huge contribution to our independence struggle. Many a time, she made decisions that propelled our achievement of independence. The Father of the Nation used to respect her a lot,\u201d the prime minister said.          \nMost Read\n   WARNING:  Any unauthorised use or reproduction of bdnews24.com content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

            "text": " \n\n\u00a008 Mar 2021 - 15:26  NEW DELHI:\u00a0India's richest state of Maharashtra accounts for more than half of both new and total active coronavirus infections, health ministry data showed on Monday, although a team of experts said the state's current wave might be \"less virulent\". Experts say India's relatively low hospitalisation and fatality rates suggest the pandemic is approaching its next phase of largely manageable local outbreaks, such as those being seen in the western industrialised state. India's tally of 11.23 million infections is the world's highest after the United States, with the state accounting for 11,141 of the 18,599 new cases reported in the past 24 hours, and 52% of the 188,747 people still infected. As a proportion of its population, however, India's virus deaths rank among the lowest in the world, rising by 97 on Monday to 157,853. The health ministry said it had sent expert teams to a quarter of Indian states and federal territories showing a rise in cases so as to understand the challenges and issues they face. One team said the spurt in Maharashtra, which has a population of more than 114 million, could be due to pandemic fatigue, village elections, weddings, the reopening of schools and crowded public transport. \"The virus is spreading to hitherto unaffected areas and most cases are asymptomatic,\" it said in a report on Saturday. \"People are not...strictly following quarantine or getting testing done. The sense is that the current wave is less virulent.\" The report did not say how the current surge was determined to be less infectious, but the Indian government earlier ruled out new variants as the cause of the rise. Hundreds of thousands travel to work each day in Maharashtra's many cities home to industries such as garments, chemicals, cars and metal factories. The federal government has asked states to prioritise vaccination in the areas worst affected. Since its drive began in mid-January, India has inoculated 17.3 million people, a fifth of them receiving the two doses required. It aims to cover 300 million of a population of 1.35 billion by August. \u00a007 Mar 2021 - 13:02 India's microblogging platform\u00a0Koo\u00a0is not competing with Twitter, but the idea behind the app is to allow users to express themselves in local languages, according to its co-founder. \u00a006 Mar 2021 - 19:14 Thousands of Indian farmers blocked a massive expressway on the edges of New Delhi on Saturday to mark the 100th day of protests against agricultural laws that they say will devastate their income. \u00a005 Mar 2021 - 13:43 India has so far given 18 million doses to about 15 million people.\n Strengthening public participation \nQatar renews commitment to providing necessary...  \nClimate change is the defining crisis of our time  \nDon\u2019t blame Pakistan for the outcome of the war...  \nQatar calls for elimination of nuclear and mass...  \nQatar and Jordan keen to strengthen fraternal...  \nCOVID-19 pandemic highlights importance of...  \nQatar wants to strengthen constructive ties with...  \nPHCC calls for rejecting all forms of violence  \nMontreal Protocol: Keeping us, our food and...  \nPlacing mental health at forefront of global...  \nQatar renews commitment to providing necessary...  \nClimate change is the defining crisis of our time  \nDon\u2019t blame Pakistan for the outcome of the war...  \nQatar calls for elimination of nuclear and mass...  \n\u00a009 Oct 2021 - 19:07\n \n\u00a009 Oct 2021 - 17:10\n \n\u00a013 Oct 2021 - 13:26\n \n\u00a015 Oct 2021 - 22:09\n \n\u00a015 Oct 2021 - 22:05\n \n\u00a015 Oct 2021 - 21:55\n Darb Al Saai activities cancelled for Qatar National Day 2021 Tickets sales for first Qatar F1 race to start on Tuesday Philippines eases capital\u2019s curbs, allows quarantine-free entry India reopens for foreign tourists as virus infections ebb Don't just talk - act on climate, Queen Elizabeth signals to world leaders Canada's Trudeau to recall parliament late Nov., opposition say he is wasting time The Peninsula newspaper provides extensive news coverage, incisive analyses and trenchant commentary from around the world, but with firm roots and primary focus on life in Qatar."

            "text": " By Priscila Hern\u00e1ndez Flores for CONNECTAS\n One of the cards that Cuba has played at international tourism fairs is its willingness to build golf courses on off-the-beaten-track beaches where luxury hotels can be built. Thus, now the island is not only a destination for tourists but also for builders, investors, and architects specialized in the demanding design of golf courses. Promotion of tourism is underway and investments in golf courses have started to reach the island. The Cuban Ministry of Tourism claims that \u201cit is currently promoting the creation of real estate agencies associated with this sport to leverage the development of tourism in Cuba.\u201d Official announcements reiterate that 27 golf courses will be designed. \u201cThis project will be completed in 25 years. This is the first phase of the first stage,\u201d the director of Cuba Golf, Raudel Garc\u00eda, explained at the beginning of construction work in Punta Colorada, one of the first projects on the island.\u00a0 For this CONNECTAS investigation into the golf course projects, a review was carried out of official information and of that published by architecture and design firms on their websites. The review confirmed that there are 12 golf courses under six ongoing projects. Work on these golf courses is progressing but it is not clear how water will be obtained for lawn maintenance. Some of the projects have promised to use wastewater. Nevertheless, there are no data on how water will be supplied in order to have golf courses that are compliant with international standards in a country that has water problems, droughts, and difficulties to supply the population with water.\u00a0 Such has been the concern for water shortages in Cuba that in 2016, during the sixth meeting of the Communist Party, specific guidelines on water use were proposed with objectives for 2020. For the first time, right there and then, it was explained that attempts would be made to develop programs to \u201censure water quality and quantity, decrease water losses and increase reutilization, and reduce energy consumption, as well as provide services associated with systems for water utilization, aqueducts, and sewers.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Cuba there are only two golf courses. An 18-hole golf course in Varadero and a nine-hole course in Havana. But with the twelve projects that are the object of this investigation, the land available to practice the sport would increase by 3,345 hectares. According to the United States Golf Association (USGA), an average golf course in that country requires around 130,000 gallons (492,103 liters) of water per day. This amount can vary depending on the weather and the area of the course. Furthermore, experts in this precision sport agree that to have a quality course it is essential to have top quality lawns. And to that end, it is absolutely necessary to have water to ensure the possibility of growing the specific variety of grass required. Nonetheless, in Cuba there are no laws to regulate the construction of golf courses or their water supply. The National Institute of Water Resources of Cuba has acknowledged that \u201cstandards in general and specifically those related to water consumption are out of date.\u201d Moreover, not only does Cuba have anachronistic laws, but also its main source of water is \u201cthe rain; the amount of precipitation is relatively low, with a yearly average of 1,335 mm.\u201d The execution of projects for the development of golf courses is the responsibility of \u201cjoint ventures.\u201d That is, companies created by a foreign and a Cuban firm, a partnership that is now allowed under the Law on Foreign Investment. The three Cuban companies with which the tourism and golf complexes were established are Palmares, Cuba Golf, and Gaviota, which is on \u00a0the US list of restricted businesses due to its association with the Cuban military. In 2014, the Cuban Ministry of Tourism promoted the development of golf courses as an extra-hotel service and a potential source of income and investment. This was the description that the Ministry used to introduce the project to the world in the document Cuba, a Country for Foreign Investment. Cuba\u2019s economic opening during the Obama administration seemed to indicate that the target market would be American golfers. Today, due to the new administrative policies of Trump, which ban cruise ships from docking in Cuba and impose restrictions on remittances sent to the island, the arrival of such tourists seems more unlikely each day. Although Americans cannot freely travel to Cuba, the new developments are still betting mainly on reaching the American market. Traditional Cuban music, a Son, introduces the video that describes the infrastructure of Punta Colorada Cuba Golf & Marina. The project includes two golf courses that are being built in Pinar del R\u00edo. This complex, according to official information, will be the first golf course in the world to have a hole in the sea. For this project, the Spanish company Playa Golf Resorts International and Cubagolf agreed to create the Punta Colorada joint venture. Work on the first stage began in March 2018. \u201cThis resort will be fully sustainable. That is, it will follow a 100% clean energy policy,\u201d Jaume Roma, president of Playa Golf Resorts International, explained. Without giving details about how the infrastructure will be supplied with water, Rafael de la Hoz, one of the professionals responsible for designing this golf course, explains in the Master Plan for Punta Colorada Golf & Marina Cuba, \u201cThe proposed design is flexible and requires low maintenance. It\u2019s intended to protect, regenerate, and highlight the heritage values and the natural resources of the place.\u201d Information provided by the developers shows that the golf courses are located on beaches like Playa Larga and Punta Luis. In contrast, the project in Pinar del R\u00edo faces a serious problem: according to the locals, the only water to which they have access is trucked water. Another project is Rancho La Luna, which Spanish Grupo Financiero Urbas intends to develop in the Municipality of Cienfuegos, one of the most affected areas by droughts in Cuba. Data provided by Urbas show that this project is to be consolidated in 25 years, a period during which five hotels and six golf courses will be built. Although the institutional website includes commercial information, there are no details about the project, nor do they explain how they will get water.\u00a0 Another development will be El Salado, an 18-hole golf course on the eponymous beach, 20 kilometers west from Havana, in the Municipality of Artemisa, in the Mariel Special Development Zone (ZEDM). A magnet for investors, this area has become the site of the flagship project of Cuba due to changes in the laws on foreign investment.\u00a0 The golf course will be built by the El Salado joint venture, created by the Spanish El Salado Resorts, based in Mallorca, and Cubagolf. This project has been in the pre-investment phase since 2018, and a feasibility study shows that work will start in 2020. A review of official information did not reveal who will be responsible for the design or how water will be supplied to the golf course and the hotels. The joint venture has provided only the following information: \u201cTopographic and geological surveys, environmental risk assessments, and photogrammetry surveying have been completed and the environmental baseline has been updated.\u201d Also, among the complexes is Carbonera Club, a tourist real estate project in Matanzas, which will be financed by British capital from Esencias Hotels. The project includes building an 18-hole golf course. The company\u2019s web site states that the design specifications consider \u201ca model for sustainable water supply for the entire complex in order to comply with international sustainability standards.\u201d It does not specify, however, from where the water will come. Chinese investors lead the Bellomonte Golf Resort project in Playa del Este, in Havana. The design plans, created by architects at Ekistics, do not explain how water will be supplied to the golf course. During the presentation of the project, they only said, \u201cEach component of Bellomonte has been carefully considered. It\u2019s a low impact, ecologically friendly development.\u201d The Cuban government has acknowledged the water crisis on the island. The 2016-2020 National Environmental Strategy summarizes the problem: \u201cCuba does not have abundant water resources; its only water source is rainfall. The intensification and recurrence of periods of drought, the inefficient use of water, and the environmental degradation resulting from pollution have created a critical situation in some places in the country.\u201d In this report, the authorities acknowledged that not only are water resources scarce on the island but also water supply is inadequate due to leaks. Estimates published by the Environmental Strategy reveal that water losses are up to 60% and \u201cthe intermittent service forces a part of the population, including those who have a domestic water supply system, to store water in tanks and other containers. This affects the quality of drinking water as does the poor conditions of the distribution system.\u201d As Cuba is an island, saltwater intrudes into drinking water supplies. This phenomenon, known as saltwater intrusion, affects water quality.\u00a0 The problems with water management in Cuba were stated in the conclusions of the Evaluation of the Cuban Environment: GeoCuba 2007, a report prepared by more than 70 government institutions and 130 Cuban experts. This effort was made possible through the support of the Cuban Ministry of Science, Technology, and the Environment (CITMA) and the sponsorship of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Another Cuban scholar, Jos\u00e9 Antonio D\u00edaz, the author of the article \u201cHacia el uso sostenible del agua en Cuba\u201d (Toward the Sustainable Use of Water in Cuba), explains that there is a \u201clow yearly rate of water available per inhabitant, excessive consumption, and large losses in the supply networks and of dammed water.\u201d Cuba has subscribed to the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. In doing so, one of its main objectives is to \u201censure drinking water extraction and supply to overcome water scarcity and significantly reduce the number of people without water.\u201d Read more: The \u201cbiggest investment of the Cuban Revolution\u201d has not yet set sail The design plans for the courses of the Buenavista Golf Club and the Carbonera Club include statements by the designers that water will be reutilized. This remains to be seen because this is not a common practice in the country. According to the 2016-2020 National Strategy, the Cuban government has informed that \u201cconsumption rates per unit of product or service are yet to be updated and correctly used. The culture of the rational use of water is still poor at the population level and in the production and service sectors. In general, Cuba has low rates of water reutilization and rainfall harvesting.\u201d Golf courses require large volumes of water. Nevertheless, in Cuba, water supply is not guaranteed even for the population, as corroborated and published in an academic paper by Juan Pacheco Segu\u00ed from the Las Villas Central University, in Cuba, and Ezequiel Pacheco, head of the Cayo Coco Golf Course investor unit. Having assessed the conditions of Cayo Coco to determine whether reutilized water would be enough, these researchers concluded that it will not. In their paper, these academics informed, \u201cIrrigation of golf course lawns consumes significant volumes of water because the objective is to provide the players with a pleasing landscape. This includes turfgrass species that require daily irrigation because of the substrate\u2014where the root system functions\u2014, which has a high percentage of sand (at least 60%, according to 1993 USGA standards) and poor water retention.\u201d In their conclusion, the authors state that for the golf course project in Cayo Coco, under the current conditions, \u201cWastewater is not enough to meet the requirements of an 18-hole golf course. Therefore, the project should be put on hold until a larger hotel development occurs in the area. Alternatively, it could use another turfgrass species, such as Paspalum vaginatum Swartz, which can be irrigated with saline water.\u201d Use of these species, however, has not yet been explored. \u201cThe first ecological golf course in Cuba.\u201d So the Buenavista Golf Club was dubbed by Ignacio Garc\u00eda, the architect responsible for the design of the golf course, which is being built by Cuban Grupo de Turismo Gaviota. The 18-hole golf course will have 80 hectares and will be built in the Province of Villa Clara. According to the architect, the area is one of the most internationally appealing tourist sites in Cuba. \u201cThis golf course was not designed under or to be part of any real estate development. It\u2018s the first ecological golf course that has been designed in Cuba in the last 60 years or more, and it will probably continue to be the only golf course that isn\u2019t associated with real estate developments on the island, one that only promotes the practice of the sport but with the utmost respect for the environment,\u201d Garc\u00eda answered in the questionnaire that CONNECTAS sent him to prepare this publication. Garc\u00eda also explained that he was offered to build this golf course during the International Tourism Fair, held in Madrid, Spain. The Vice President of Development and Business of Grupo de Turismo Gaviota invited him to participate in the bid, and his proposal won. Regarding the technical aspects of the golf course, Garc\u00eda, the founder and manager of IGGA Internacional, explained that the project also includes practice schools. He added, \u201cThe design meets USGA standards so that, once finished, it will be one of the best golf courses in the Caribbean, a Championship Golf Course, capable of hosting all sorts of international tournaments. USGA regulations only apply to the characteristics of a golf course turf, not to technical irrigation aspects. When asked how to understand what he means by ecological golf course, especially because regular golf courses are associated with \u222bhigh levels of water consumption, the architect said, without elaborating, \u201cRegrettably, not all the golf courses that are being designed and developed are ecological. Nevertheless, those that are sustainably designed, built, and managed and add positive value to society and the environment are ecological.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Garc\u00eda maintains that the golf course the he is designing underwent an environmental impact assessment. With this study, GeoCuba\u2019s Environmental Agency endorsed the design plan for several reasons, including because it will not disturb the ruins of the Dolores Sugarcane Mill\u2014a cultural heritage site in Cuba. With regard to legal regulations, Garc\u00eda claims that his project complies with CITMA\u2019s Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations and Cuban Standard NC 69: 1999 \u201cRequirements for the scope and content of technical services for tourist investments.\u201d This legislation was enacted 20 years ago before the amendment to the Law on Investments, which allows foreign companies to build golf courses. About the species of grass\u2014a factor that determines water consumption\u2014, Garc\u00eda informed that they will build a practice golf course of 10,000 square meters in the same area to experiment with different types of grass and observe their behavior over a year. This exercise may become a program to produce grass for sports fields in Cuba.\u00a0 The founder of IGGA Internacional stated that because of the shortage of trees in the area, they decided to carry out a forestation project. Regarding water catchment, he explained that his design plan features the following: \u201cIn case of hurricanes, it has an open drainage system that uses natural run-off. It also includes grass swales that have been prepared to resist the strong rains\u2014that affect this area of the island every year\u2014and to collect and divert rainwater to the lakes and from there to the irrigation lake of the golf course.\u201d In addition, Garc\u00eda explained that the design will include the construction of a wastewater treatment plant in the Municipality of Caibari\u00e9n, Remedios. The treated water will be used to irrigate the golf course, as opposed to the proposal to use drinking water from the wells that supply the Cayos de Villa Clara tourist resort. Golf courses are sources of investment and income in different parts of the world. Spain is one of the European countries where the number of golf courses has increased\u2014from \u00a0211 in 2000 to 497 in 2019. Of these, several are located in drought areas. This increase has had such an impact that Spanish scholars have studied the environmental problem created by golf courses that were developed without ecological plans or without considering water consumption, the types of grasses, or the pesticides required. Experts from the agency Ingenieros Consultores en Medio Ambiente (ICMA), \u00c1lvaro de la Barreda and I\u00f1igo Sobrini, reviewed construction reports on golf courses in Spain. Their conclusion was that \u201cgolf courses should not have environmental impacts. There is an environmental impact when the golf courses are badly located, badly conceived, badly designed, badly built, or badly managed.\u201d When asked what should be done about the increase in golf courses, the academics explained, \u201cIf there is demand, it should be met the best way possible and with the least impact.\u201d For these experts, the ecological approach has many advantages, including \u201ca decrease in water consumption and pesticide use, savings due to fewer ground movements, minimum maintenance costs, and economic savings.\u201d Furthermore, this approach helps a project to gain social approval. To determine how water supply will be guaranteed in drought areas or in places where water supply to the population is limited, CONNECTAS sent questionnaires to all six companies that are associated with the twelve golf projects. The objective was to learn about the water management plans for the golf courses and the tourist complexes. Some of the companies confirmed receipt of the questionnaires and said that they would respond to the interview request. All this notwithstanding, they did not. CONNECTAS also sought access to the official version of the Cuban State. To that end, it sent interview requests to the Cuban Ministries of Tourism, Foreign Affairs, and Science, Technology and the Environment, as well as the National Institute of Water Resources. Although they confirmed receipt of the requests, they never responded. Golf, as a sport targeting an international market, has become an option to generate income in Cuba. Nonetheless, its own territory makes Cuba vulnerable to the effects of climate change and persistent droughts. Therefore, if, in the end, the golf courses are built, water supply issues will have to be addressed, among many others that, today, remain unsatisfactorily resolved.

            "text": "  A giant dam was supposed to help lift Ecuador out of poverty. Instead, it\u2019s part of a national scandal, and a future tethered to China. Credit...Federico Rios Escobar for The New York Times Supported by By Nicholas Casey and Clifford Krauss REVENTADOR, Ecuador \u2014 The dam sits under the glare of an active volcano, with columns of ash spewing toward the sky. Officials had warned against the dam for decades. Geologists said an earthquake could wipe it away. Now, only two years after opening, thousands of cracks are splintering the dam\u2019s machinery. Its reservoir is clogged with silt, sand and trees. And the only time engineers tried to throttle up the facility completely, it shook violently and shorted out the national electricity grid. This giant dam in the jungle, financed and built by China, was supposed to christen Ecuador\u2019s vast ambitions, solve its energy needs and help lift the small South American country out of poverty. Instead, it has become part of a national scandal engulfing the country in corruption, perilous amounts of debt \u2014 and a future tethered to China. Nearly every top Ecuadorean official involved in the dam\u2019s construction is either imprisoned or sentenced on bribery charges. That includes a former vice president, a former electricity minister and even the former anti-corruption official monitoring the project, who was caught on tape talking about Chinese bribes. Then there is the price tag: around $19 billion in Chinese loans, not only for this dam, known as Coca Codo Sinclair, but also for bridges, highways, irrigation, schools, health clinics and a half dozen other dams the government is scrambling to pay for. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Ecuador can afford them. China gets paid either way. To settle the bill, China gets to keep 80 percent of Ecuador\u2019s most valuable export \u2014 oil \u2014 because many of the contracts are repaid in petroleum, not dollars. In fact, China gets the oil at a discount, then sells it for an additional profit. Pumping enough oil to repay China has become such an imperative for Ecuador that it is drilling deeper in the Amazon, threatening more deforestation. But that is not enough. Hobbled by the debts, President Len\u00edn Moreno has slashed social spending, gasoline subsidies, several government agencies and more than 1,000 public jobs. Most economists expect the country to slide into recession, stirring outrage. \u201cChina took advantage of Ecuador,\u201d said Ecuador\u2019s energy minister, Carlos P\u00e9rez. \u201cThe strategy of China is clear. They take economic control of countries.\u201d The story of how the dam got built brings together two natural allies, both eager to change the course of the hemisphere and displace the United States as the unrivaled power in the region. China made its plans clear a decade ago, when it swept into Latin America during the global financial crisis, tossing governments an economic lifeline and promising to \u201ctreat each other as equals,\u201d a clear swipe at American dominance. It worked. China, now South America\u2019s top trading partner, has seeded the region with infrastructure and a staggering trail of loans. It has reaped political benefits, too, getting Latin American nations to sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Still, as the giant dam in Ecuador shows, the two sides were hardly equal partners. Both nations were willing to overlook deep design flaws, questionable economics and independent warnings that the technical studies for the dam were decades out of date. But using an approach it has applied to billions of dollars in loans across the developing world, China never faced much of a financial risk. The gamble was all Ecuador\u2019s, and now the country is looking for new loans to plug its many gaps, including more money from China. Just this month, Mr. Moreno flew to China to renegotiate some of his country\u2019s debt \u2014 and borrow another $900 million. \u201cThe Chinese put the hook in,\u201d said Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins economist. \u201cAt the end of the day, what do these countries have? A pig in a poke.\u201d When Fernando Santos, an energy minister in the 1980s, found out that the Coca Codo Sinclair dam was actually being built, he could hardly believe it. During his time in government, officials had rejected a much smaller version of the project. The whole idea was doomed, he said, because of the volcano nearby. A major earthquake had decimated oil infrastructure in the area in 1987. \u201cThe volcano has been erupting since the time the Spanish came to Ecuador in the 16th century,\u201d Mr. Santos said, adding that investing so much money \u201cin such a risky location was nonsense.\u201d There were other alarm bells. An independent review of the project in 2010, prepared by a Mexican government agency and obtained by The New York Times, warned that the amount of water in the region to power the dam had not been studied for nearly 30 years. Since that time, Ecuador had suffered punishing droughts, and there were concerns that its glaciers were melting because of climate change. Despite the advice, Luciano Cepeda, the dam\u2019s former general manager, said top Ecuadorean officials pressed ahead anyway because \u201ca new study would have taken several years\u201d and they didn\u2019t want to slow down. Even a Chinese diplomat in Ecuador, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said he had his doubts about the project. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give sufficient attention to the environmental reporting,\u201d the diplomat said. China\u2019s record offered both encouragement and cause for concern. Its massive Three Gorges Dam, which cuts the Yangtze River and rises 600 feet high, was the largest hydroelectric project in the world, designed to produce 20 times the power of the Hoover Dam. But inadequate safety measures led to the deaths of 100 workers, the dam displaced more than one million people, and the environmental damage was considerable, including the destruction of forests. Warnings aside, there were bigger geopolitical forces at play. Ecuador\u2019s president at the time, Rafael Correa, was a left-wing populist who had vowed to modernize his country and free it from the orbit of the United States. Elected in 2006 under a surge that brought leftists to power across Latin America, Mr. Correa took aim at the United States with fiery, anti-imperialist speeches. In 2008, he refused to renew a lease that allowed American anti-narcotics surveillance flights to operate from an Ecuadorean air force base. Soon, Western financial institutions fell in Mr. Correa\u2019s cross hairs. He denounced the International Monetary Fund, saying it put restrictions on his spending. Then in 2008, he defaulted on $3.2 billion of his country\u2019s foreign debt and invited China to fill in the breach. \u201cCorrea wanted to get away from Western banks and institutions,\u201d said Diego Borja, Mr. Correa\u2019s former minister of economic coordination. \u201cWe knew this relationship wouldn\u2019t be an easy one with China.\u201d Mr. Borja and other officials were staggered by the terms on Chinese loans. Most came from a large state-owned lender, the Chinese Export-Import Bank, which had high interest rates and required Ecuador to use Chinese companies in construction, effectively eliminating competition. China seemed particularly interested in oil from Ecuador, one of OPEC\u2019s smallest members. In one deal in 2009, China lent Ecuador $1 billion, to be repaid in oil shipments to the state oil company PetroChina. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t have other options,\u201d Mr. Borja recalled. \u201cThe doors were closed to the West.\u201d Mr. Correa suddenly had access to money, but a new crisis emerged: The country was running out of power. A drought was depleting the nation\u2019s reservoirs, paralyzing its dams. Rather than look for another source, Mr. Correa doubled down on hydro power. Officials say it was Mr. Correa\u2019s electricity minister, Aleksey Mosquera, who first mentioned Coca Codo Sinclair: a megaproject that was supposed to provide a third of the country\u2019s electricity and represent the single largest investment in Ecuador\u2019s history. It ended up being built right under the Reventador volcano \u2014 and nearly twice the size of the proposed dam that had been rejected decades before. When it finally opened in late 2016, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, flew to Ecuador to celebrate. Yet only two days before the visit, the dam was in chaos. Engineers had tried to generate the project\u2019s full 1500 megawatts, but neither the facility nor Ecuador\u2019s electrical grid could handle it. The equipment shuddered dangerously, and blackouts spread across the country, officials said. Ecuadoreans were never told about the failure, and a full power test has not been attempted since. Today, the dam typically runs at half capacity. Experts say that given its design \u2014 and the cycle of wet and dry seasons in Ecuador \u2014 it would be able to generate the full amount of electricity for only a few hours a day, six months out of the year. That is, if everything worked perfectly. Ecuador still has to pay back the debt, though. The $1.7 billion loan from China\u2019s Export-Import Bank is lucrative for China: 7 percent interest over 15 years. In interest alone, Ecuador owes $125 million a year. Now, many Ecuadoreans say the burden falls on them. Under the constant hum of the dam\u2019s transmission towers, residents in the town of Cuyuja worry that the towers will topple in the constant mudslides. Geologists say the tower foundations weren\u2019t built into bedrock by the Chinese. Another complaint is the bill. Maria Esther Tello paid $60 last month to keep the lights on in her home, a shock given the government\u2019s promises electricity prices would go down. \u201cWhere have my old mother\u2019s taxes gone?\u201d asked her daughter, Isbela Nole, as she helped harvest and peel fava beans to pay the government. At an entrance to the dam is an inscription, in marble. \u201cJorge Glas Espinel, vice president of the republic,\u201d it says. \u201cFor having forged and envisioned this monumental project.\u201d Mr. Glas now sits in a cell in Ecuador, sentenced to six years in prison. He was convicted of taking bribes from China\u2019s main competitor for infrastructure projects in much of Latin America: Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction giant. American prosecutors say Odebrecht paid $33.5 million in bribes in Ecuador as part of a worldwide scheme to win business. Now Ecuadorean officials are investigating whether the Chinese also made payments to Mr. Glas and others around him. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that all the same people managed all these projects,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez, the energy minister. The officials include Mr. Mosquera, the former electricity minister, who is serving a five-year sentence for taking $1 million from Odebrecht; and Carlos P\u00f3lit, the former anti-corruption official, who was charged with receiving millions in bribes from the company. Ricardo Rivera, another close associate of Mr. Glas, was also convicted of receiving payments from the Brazilians. But evidence has emerged suggesting that officials took bribes from China as well. Ecuadorean law enforcement officials say they have confirmed a secret tape recorded by an Odebrecht executive, given to Brazilian prosecutors and leaked to the Brazilian news media. In the recording, made at the house of Mr. P\u00f3lit, the anti-corruption official, the two men discuss a bribe. The executive can be heard saying that Mr. Glas, Ecuador\u2019s vice president, was \u201casking for a lot of money.\u201d The executive then explained that he was told \u201cit was an obligation because the Chinese had already paid.\u201d The recording has set off an investigation, particularly around Mr. Rivera, who presented himself as the vice president\u2019s representative during multiple visits to China, according to Ecuadorean law enforcement officials. They say they are examining 13 bank transfers worth $17.4 million authorized by Mr. Rivera to an HSBC account in Hong Kong. Law enforcement officials say they consider the bank transfers authentic \u2014 and want to know how Mr. Rivera deposited so much money in China. Until recently, Attorney General Pa\u00fal P\u00e9rez was leading an investigation into corruption by the Chinese, and traveled to China in November to ask for help. But Mr. P\u00e9rez abruptly resigned on Nov. 13, shortly after returning. He did not respond to interview requests. A lawyer for Mr. Glas denied that his client had been involved in corruption with Coca Coda Sinclair, calling Mr. Glas \u201can honorable, honest man\u201d and describing the dam\u2019s problems as \u201csmall imperfections.\u201d Mr. Correa, the former president, is in exile in Belgium, wanted for organizing the kidnapping of a rival. Many of his lieutenants have been sentenced for corruption or are on the run as well. Mr. P\u00f3lit and a lawyer for Mr. Rivera did not respond to requests for comment; nor did Sinohydro, the Chinese state-owned construction giant that built the dam. Mr. Polit did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but after publication his lawyer said that his client denied any wrongdoing. When you approach Coca Codo Sinclair along the Quijos River, it\u2019s hard to tell you\u2019re nearing a dam at all. Much of the reservoir containing the project\u2019s water supply has filled up with small trees and bushes. Boats sometimes get grounded because the sediment is so thick. Workers at the dam say the silting, a consequence of design flaws, is only the latest problem. As early as 2014, technicians noticed cracks in the Chinese-made stainless steel equipment. That December, 13 workers were killed when a tunnel flooded and collapsed. A senior engineer sent records to Mr. Correa, the president, asking to brief him on the problems, according to documents viewed by The Times. The engineer was fired days later, according to former officials. Mr. P\u00f3lit, the anti-corruption official, performed audits. But they resulted in only mild criticism like work delays, with minor fines against the Chinese. Ecuadorean law enforcement officials say they are investigating whether Mr. P\u00f3lit and other officials were paid by the Chinese to overlook the problems. It was part of Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s inquiry before his resignation, they say. Now, 7,648 cracks have developed in the dam\u2019s machinery, according to the government, because of substandard steel and inadequate welding by Sinohydro. Sand and silt are also big concerns because they can damage vital equipment. On a recent visit, an engineer looked on nervously as readouts showed sand flowing into the dam. But workers say they\u2019re sometimes confused because of shoddy translations. One sign in Chinese reads correctly: \u201cDirect-Current (DC) Pumping Group.\u201d The Spanish does not: \u201cPressure Group from Washington, D.C.\u201d The communication problems extend downriver. The heavy sedimentation means engineers sporadically release large amounts of water to clear out the system, causing flash floods where Carlos Usam\u00e1, a sugar cane farmer, lives. No one warns him, he says. In December, he said, his brother and a friend were fishing near another Chinese-built dam when a similar flood washed them away. The bodies were found two days later, he said. The piles of debt have led the country\u2019s new leaders to rail against China much as they did against the United States. \u201cWe are not going to pay,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez, the energy minister, said of the possible billion-dollar price tag to fix Coca Codo Sinclair. But escaping China\u2019s orbit will be difficult, said Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting company. \u201cThey know they don\u2019t have too many financing sources, so they are going back to knocking on China\u2019s door,\u201d she said. China has already made some concessions to Ecuador, like paying 92 cents more per barrel of oil. The share of Ecuador\u2019s oil going to the Chinese has also dropped \u2014 to 80 percent, from 90 percent. But the government still needs $11.7 billion to finance its debt, and it is billions short, analysts say. Beyond China, the new government is going back to the institutions Mr. Correa demonized: the World Bank and the I.M.F. Some worry that Ecuador is simply seeking another set of financial masters. \u201cWe are addicted to loans,\u201d said Mr. Santos, the former energy minister. Leopoldo G\u00f3mez, who works at a water treatment facility built under Mr. Correa, agrees. \u201cNow we realize,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s things we didn\u2019t need \u2014 like the dam.\u201d Advertisement"

Una de las fuentes de financiamiento de este proyecto que, luego de 26 a\u00f1os, no ha concluido, fueron los fondos previsionales (dinero de los afiliados) del Instituto Ecuatoriano de seguridad Social (IESS), incumpliendo la Constituci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica que expresa que \u201clos fondos y reservas del seguro universal obligatorio ser\u00e1n propios y distintos de los del fisco, y servir\u00e1n para cumplir de forma adecuada los fines de su creaci\u00f3n y sus funciones\u201d. Se presume que el economista Rafael Correa Delgado, en su calidad de Ministro de Econom\u00eda y Finanzas, cometi\u00f3 el delito de tr\u00e1fico de influencias; y como Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica, permiti\u00f3 la terminaci\u00f3n irregular de contratos ocasionando el menoscabo de fondos p\u00fablicos. De la misma manera, en conocimiento de los detalles de la financiaci\u00f3n del proyecto, continu\u00f3 favoreciendo negociaciones que contraven\u00edan normativa expresa, comprometiendo incluso la soberan\u00eda del Estado, por lo que se presume adem\u00e1s, su participaci\u00f3n en los delitos de peculado, delincuencia organizada y asociaci\u00f3n il\u00edcita. Asimismo, existe la presunci\u00f3n del delito de c\u00f3mplice de peculado del Ing.

EPA-EFE/ABI Photo provided by the Bolivian Information Agency (ABI) showing Bolivian President Evo Morales, speaking during the inauguration of a hydroelectric plant in Cochabamba, Bolivia, Jan. 17, 2018. EPA-EFE/ABI China is willing to help Bolivia reach its goal of becoming South America's electricity hub, the Asian nation's ambassador to La Paz said here Wednesday during the inauguration of a hydroelectric plant. China wants to \"expand cooperation in the hydroelectric area to make Bolivia the true energy heart of South America,\" Liang Yu said in the presence of Bolivian President Evo Morales. The plant, known as San Jose I, was built by Chinese state-owned hydropower engineering company Sinohydro in the central province of Cochabamba at a cost of $139 million. Chinese companies participate in several projects being undertaken by the Bolivian government, including road construction; sugar, potassium and steel plants; a public safety system upgrade; and telecommunications. Bolivia, which expects to produce 3,000 megawatts (MW) by executing several hydroelectric projects, has set a goal of exporting 1,000 MW of electricity by 2020. Morales said Wednesday's inauguration of San Jose 1 had added 55 MW to the Andean nation's electric generating capacity, which previously had totaled 2,100 MW. The president noted that at times of greatest demand Bolivia consumes 1,500 MW and that surplus amounts could be exported. The San Jose project consists of two plants: the 55-MW power station inaugurated Wednesday and a second that will add an additional 69 MW to Bolivia's National Interconnected System (SIN). The inauguration of the first stage comes three and a half years after Bolivian firm Guaracachi, a unit of state-owned electric utility ENDE, signed a contract for the project with Sinohydro in June 2014."

We encourage you to republish China Dialogue articles, online or in print, under the Creative Commons license. Please read our republishing guidelines to get started.    Ning Hui    July 5, 2019September 7, 2020 This article is followed by\u00a0another\u00a0also written by Ning Hui, an Initium Media journalist, with support from the Pulitzer Center\u2019s Rainforest Journalism Fund and Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano of Di\u00e1logo Chino.\u00a0 In the mountains of southern Ecuador the future of a Chinese-owned gold mine hangs in the balance. Via the courts local groups have managed to stop extraction at the Rio Blanco mine. But President Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s government has appealed the ruling. The story of Rio Blanco reveals the complex problems facing mining in Ecuador: inadequate public consultations; fraught questions of indigenous identities and rights; local versus state power; the protection of scarce natural resources.  Shortly after driving through the beautiful mountains, lakes and grasslands of Ecuador\u2019s Cajas National Park, Elizabeth Durazno and I reached the first road to the Rio Blanco gold mine. Elizabeth, who hails from the village closest to the mine, frowned at the piece of wood propped up in our path. She lowered her voice to complain: \u201cWe built that road ourselves.\u00a0Now the mining company is blocking it. We don\u2019t even have the right to use our own road\u2026\u201d She and I stopped by the roadblock and a man emerged from a nearby hut. I\u2019m not sure if he was a mining company employee, but perhaps he recognised her. Without speaking he removed the pole and allowed our car to enter. She spoke proudly as we travelled up the steep mountain road: \u201cWe made our own checkpoint before they did.\u201d The first one was built in May 2018, by the villagers of San Pedro de Yumate on the other road to the gold mine. \u201cMining company vehicles are not allowed to pass,\u201d the village head had declared. As you travel higher in the Andes, the climate changes. Rio Blanco, up in the mountains, enjoys cloudless days. San Pedro de Yumate, lower down, has the humidity and precipitation of a rainforest. It rained constantly that day in San Pedro de Yumate, with the water gathering in muddy puddles. The original roadblock was still in place, with a guard hut not yet finished beside it. A slogan on a nearby wall could easily have been missed: \u201cAgainst the terrorist state accomplices of the mining transnationals!\u201d Another slogan at the entrance to the mountains was more visible, and decorated with a skull: \u201cMining pollutes water and infringes sovereignty \u2013 China out!\u201d (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) A history of broken promises As Ecuador is unindustrialised it relies heavily on oil exports and has suffered as prices have fallen in recent years. The country has a 750 kilometre stretch of mostly undeveloped deposits of copper, silver, gold and zinc.\u00a0Its government hopes mining will improve economic growth. In 2015 mining accounted for 0.42% of its GDP. The government wants that to be 4% by 2021. Chinese investment has taken a lead role in fulfilling that goal. Three of Ecuador\u2019s five most important mines are funded and operated by Chinese firms.\u00a0Both the Mirador and San Carlos-Panantza copper mines, in the Amazonian south-east corner of Ecuador, are owned by a joint venture between Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group and the China Railway Construction Corporation. The third is the Rio Blanco gold mine, owned by Hong Kong\u2019s Junefield Mineral Resources and the Hunan Gold Corporation. Way back in 1993 the British company Rio Tinto-Zinc started prospecting here, before the Canadian firm International Minerals took over. In 2013 Junefield Ecuagoldmining S.A. \u2013 the Ecuadorian arm of Junefield Mineral Resources \u2013 bought the site and in 2015 it received a license to mine. According to Junefield\u2019s\u00a0website, the Rio Blanco project includes four mining concessions covering\u00a05,708 hectares and with an expected lifetime output of 15.7 tonnes of gold and 100 tonnes of silver. Nothing impressive when compared with a major gold mining nation such as Peru, but big enough to be of strategic importance for Ecuador. In April 2018, 25 years after Rio Blanco local people heard the mountain they lived on contained gold, news broke that Junefield had officially started mining the metal. Andres Durazno, Elizabeth Durazno\u2019s uncle, is in his fifties and farms trout in a mountain lake. He looked grave as he spoke: \u201cAt first, that [British] company told us that life would be easy once there was a mine. But the reality? It\u2019s been over 20 years, has anyone\u2019s life got easier? If you ask me, we\u2019re poorer.\u201d The road in the village of Rio Blanco is empty. Elizabeth explained that 200 people once lived here, but many had moved to the historic city of Cuenca, 30 kilometres away, where there is work and a high school. Some sold their land to the mining firm before leaving. Elizabeth and her four children now live in Cuenca. About 20 local people emerge when word gets round a reporter has arrived. Most of them have worked at the mine, as cleaners, cooks, drivers or labourers. There is little other work here apart from raising fish or farming, and so any opportunity is valuable. Big mining firms need good community relations to ensure their own operations can run smoothly. The local people say that when the British and Canadian firms were prospecting they sent \u201csociologists\u201d to speak with them. They received various promises: gifts of sewing machines and cooking equipment, new clinics and roads, investment in agriculture. But \u201csoon after they\u2019d change our contact person and negotiations had to start from scratch.\u201d The talks stopped altogether when the Chinese arrived, and the number of jobs available fell. Junefield reduced the number of workers and cut hours; currently employees work an average of five days a month, meaning incomes have fallen sharply. Although drilling for oil started in Ecuador in the 1920s, mining projects run by transnational firms are much more recent. So when teams of foreigners started turning up in Rio Blanco promising to make everyone rich by digging up gold, the villagers weren\u2019t sure what to think. As Andres said: \u201cWe\u2019d never even seen a mine. We thought it would be a good thing.\u201d They soon realised the foreigners and their machines would bring huge changes but no real benefits. Both the company and the community have control over barriers that control access to one of the two roads to R\u00edo Blanco. (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) Andres lists the \u201ccrimes\u201d of Junefield: the quiet filling in of a mountain lake; the appropriation of a mountain road in use for generations, with a roadblock preventing local people using it; the storing of mining explosives near a water source. \u201cWe\u2019ve woken up now,\u201d Andres said. A young villager added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t wanted anything to do with the mine since 2017.\u201d San Pedro de Yumate is a little further away and not directly affected by the mine but opposition has been rising there too.\u00a0And its location has allowed it to cut off access to the mine. Village head Chillpi said: \u201cAt first we were like lambs obediently following the [Canadian] mining company.\u201d Local people were encouraged to attend a pro-mine demonstration in the capital city of Quito, with travel and accommodation paid for. Everyone was happy to do so but then when they wanted something the company was nowhere to be found. The villagers also blocked the road, with burning tyres, during the Canadian firm\u2019s tenure. The company\u2019s president arrived from the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, and promised to build an irrigation system, a community centre and to provide more jobs. But since Junefield took over, the two villages haven\u2019t had the chance to start negotiations. They\u2019ve never even seen a Chinese person: \u201cThey don\u2019t care about what we have to say.\u201d The two faces of President Rafael Correa In November 2017, Andres joined a demonstration against the mine in Quito where he met Yaku Sacha P\u00e9rez, a Cuenca-based lawyer specialising in water and indigenous peoples. He asked Andres if the government or company had carried out prior consultation with local communities before developing the mine. \u201cWhat\u2019s prior consultation? We\u2019d never heard of it before,\u201d Elizabeth recalled.  \u201cAgainst the terrorist state accomplices of the mining transnationals! \u2026\u00a0Against the megamining\u201d\u00a0(Image: Ning Hui) Prior consultation is a civil right, more fully expressed as the right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), included in the 2006 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The vast majority of the world\u2019s 400 million indigenous people live in poverty, accounting for 5% of the global population but 15% of the poor. Because of where they live\u00a0they are often affected by global demand for energy and resources. This led to the idea of FPIC as a prerequisite for any activity that affects their ancestral lands, territories and natural resources. But often there is little drive to protect the interests of vulnerable groups, and implementation of FPIC has been difficult in the majority of countries with indigenous populations. This was not the case in Ecuador, thanks to Rafael Correa, president of the country between 2007 and 2017. While campaigning and in office, Correa advocated for indigenous people\u2019s rights and sustainable development, and the end of \u201cexploitative capitalism\u201d by mainly American and European investors. Correa declared the country\u2019s US$3.2 billion of foreign debt illegal and refused to pay it back. When US and European firms moved out, Chinese investors moved in. The China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China lent Ecuador US$18.4 billion between 2005 and 2018. In 2008 Correa called a constitutional convention, at which FPIC and the rights of nature \u2013 the belief that all forms of life have the right to exist \u2013 were added to the country\u2019s constitution. However, the definition of FPIC in the convention was changed: the requirement for indigenous people to be informed of plans in good time was retained, but their consent was no longer needed. Ecuador still doesn\u2019t have the policies to ensure indigenous people enjoy the\u00a0right to FPIC. And while Correa benefited politically from promises to protect Amazonian ecosystems and indigenous rights, he also indicated a wish to exploit natural resources by saying things that run contrary to the spirit of the constitution such as\u00a0\u201cWe cannot be a beggar sitting atop a sack of gold\u201d. But FPIC has proved powerful in court, especially international courts. In July 2012 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (set up by the Organisation of American States to rule on whether states have violated an individual\u2019s human rights) found that foreign oil firms had taken over territories belonging to the indigenous communities in the Sarayaku region of Ecuador without prior consultation. This was a landmark decision, which gave local people in places like Rio Blanco a precedent to refer to. A key part of that precedent was protecting the FPIC rights of indigenous people. But in Rio Blanco, the local people had never heard of FPIC rights, and did not actually think of themselves as indigenous. Resistance through protest and legal action Today Rio Blanco is recognised as an indigenous community by the Federation of Indigenous and Peasant Organisations (FOA) in Azuay province, an organisation for indigenous people and farmers and part of Ecuador\u2019s Confederation of Peoples of Kichwa Nationality (ECUARUNARI). There are almost 2.6 million Kichwa in Ecuador, the country\u2019s largest indigenous ethnic group, spread across the Andes and the Amazon rainforest. ECUARUNARI works with similar bodies representing indigenous peoples based in the Amazon and on the coast, via the Confederation of Indigenous People of Ecuador (CONAIE). These bodies bring together Ecuador\u2019s four million indigenous people \u2013 25% of the country\u2019s population. Lauro Sigcha is chair of the FOA. In early 2018, after Rio Blanco local people learned they had the right to be consulted by the mining company, they contacted his organisation. (Image: Ning Hui) \u201cThe mine\u2019s actually been there for years. The villagers originally had high hopes for it.\u201d Sigcha comes from another village which has protested against mining and is familiar with these struggles. \u201cThese villages are forgotten by the government. They get no teachers, no hospitals, no roads. So when foreign mining firms turn up, the villagers hope they will meet these basic needs and provide jobs.\u201d When jobs didn\u2019t materialise, the villagers started to protest. Sigcha explained: \u201cThe villagers found that combining protests with broader social and environmental issues was more effective. So they looked for people with protest experience, and found ourselves and the lawyer, Yaku Sacha.\u201d Then the villagers\u2019 identity as indigenous people became a factor in the protests. \u201cMy father\u2019s generation would get punished by their parents if they picked up any Kichwa [language]. In Ecuador, being indigenous is nothing to be proud of,\u201d\u00a0explained Sigcha. The majority of Kichwa people simply describe themselves as farmers. Indigenous people\u2019s groups have three criteria for designating a community as indigenous: self-identification as indigenous, the indigenous heritage of the locality and communal management of local land. Several of the common surnames in Rio Blanco are Kichwa, allowing the villagers to self-identify as indigenous. And records in a nearby church proved that Kichwa people had lived here in the past. This allowed the villagers to found their own indigenous group, to make use of FPIC rights and take Junefield to court. On July 23, 2018, Rio Blanco joined the FOA. That year opposition to the mine by local communities also gained support from anti-mining and environmental activists from other cities. The Rio Blanco mine lies close to the environmentally vulnerable Cajas National Park and important water sources for Cuenca and other nearby cities. Environmental groups have always objected to the mine\u2019s plans to use almost 1,000 litres of water per hour. The conflict came to a head in May 2018. Protestors invaded the mine, damaging roads and burning camps. The government dispatched hundreds of police and soldiers in response. Meanwhile, Yaku Sacha lodged a case in the provincial court bought by the villagers of Rio Blanco and other nearby villages against the mining and environmental authorities. On June 5, judge Paul Serrano found that there had been no prior consultation with local communities, as required under the constitution and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and ordered a temporary halt on all mine activity. On August 3, the court rejected a company appeal attempting to restart operations. This was the first time a court in Ecuador had found in favour of indigenous communities because of foreign mining firms failing to carry out prior consultation, and the precedent encouraged others. A similar lawsuit against the Chinese-funded Mirador copper mine is underway, with the plaintiffs referring to the Rio Blanco decision in their case. An unlikely candidate Yaku Sacha used to be known as Carlos Ranulfo. He changed his name in 2017. His new moniker\u00a0is Kichwa for \u201cthe water which flows from the mountain\u201d. In March 2019 posters and stickers of him appeared all over Cuenca. Elizabeth Durazno had one on the window of her car, and there was one by the roadblock in San Pedro de Yumate. Local elections were to be held on March 24 and as candidate for the local indigenous party, Pachakutik, he sought to become governor of Azuay, the province in which Cuenca is situated, under the title\u00a0\u201cThe protector of water.\u201d It is rare for indigenous people to stand for election in Ecuador, and even rarer for them to win. When we met Yaku Sacha there were still two weeks to the elections. He had tied his long hair back and was wearing a traditional Kichwa necklace, standing by a busy road handing out flyers to passing drivers. Many recognised him and were happy to take a flyer, while others waved him off. At dusk he headed back to his campaign headquarters \u2013 his law office. He showed no signs of fatigue\u00a0when we asked about the Rio Blanco case.\u00a0\u201cLegal action, social action and political action are complementary,\u201d he said. Yaku Sacha on the campaign trail (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) Having just turned 50, Yaku Sacha sees his role as \u201copposing capitalists and politicians\u201d. Rio Blanco\u00a0is just one of the lawsuits in which he has represented indigenous communities. He is sure Junefield and the other companies carried out no prior consultation: \u201cIt\u2019s their normal way of operating. They confuse prior consultation with normal social interaction.\u201d \u201cIdeally, those companies would hold talks with nearby communities before development starts, whether those communities are indigenous or not,\u201d he says. \u201cBut because there\u2019s an international treaty specifically for indigenous people in place, those lawsuits are more effective.\u201d He and the villagers also add environmental concerns to their opposition, describing themselves as protecting water resources, rather than opposing the mine. As far as the government is concerned, they\u2019re all just troublemakers. In September 2018, Fernando Benalcazar became vice-minister for mining at the Ministry of Energy and Non-renewable Resources. He was blunt in his dismissal of the villagers\u2019 \u201copposition\u201d, calling them\u00a0\u201ca small group with ulterior motives stirring up the situation.\u201d \u201cTen or so people want to decide for everyone in Ecuador, it makes no sense.\u201d Benalcazar has been a senior mining official for decades and is clearly unhappy with the government\u2019s defeat in court. He thinks community leaders in Rio Blanco are backed by illegal miners, or their own political ambitions. He thinks the rights of indigenous people are being misused by opportunists who want to bring lawsuits and says \u201cthe leaders aren\u2019t the indigenous people \u2026 the site belongs to the nation. There\u2019s simply no need for prior consultation.\u201d He also told us that the checkpoint which Elizabeth Durazno was angry about had been permitted by the national police. The checkpoint at San Pedro de Yumate (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) The other checkpoint, built by the villagers of San Pedro de Yumate, has also been a flashpoint. The villagers have used it stop both Junefield vehicles and people from Cochapamba \u2013 most of whom support the mine. Manuel Mueveclea is from Cochapamba, and described the methods of San Pedro de Yumate\u00a0villagers as \u201cviolent and extreme, infringing on our basic rights.\u201d He says people passing the checkpoint are asked if they oppose the mine. If they answer no, they are told not to use that road. He complains his mother was once held there\u00a0from 6pm until 2am. Villagers of Rio Blanco and San Pedro de Yumate react fiercely when you mention Cochapamba. Yaku Sacha has received numerous death threats, and he and three others have been kidnapped and beaten near the mine. He recalls being told during the eight hours he was held to \u201creturn our job opportunities, return our company money.\u201d And while there\u2019s no proof, local people are sure mine-supporting villagers from Cochapamba are responsible. Families torn apart It has now been over a year since the historic court victory. In the opinion of Andres Durazno, the Rio Blanco fish farmer: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what the decision really means.\u201d Winning in court hasn\u2019t solved the daily problems of the villagers and the community is continuing to fragment. When we visited the village we spoke to about 20 villagers, the majority of whom opposed the mine. Yet many of their relations may support it. Families have been torn apart by arguments over the mine. Elizabeth Durazno enjoys her new indigenous identity and often asks Yaku Sacha to teach her a few lines of Kichwa. She liked sitting down in court as equals with the mining company even more, and laughs as she remembers the scene: \u201cThe company thought they\u2019d get rid of us easily.\u201d The victory has turned Rio Blanco into a model for other communities, with visitors often coming to ask for advice, or villagers travelling to \u201ctell our story.\u201d The villagers\u2019 case focused on water resources, turning the essential liquid\u00a0into the most important topic in local politics. Yaku Sacha was victorious in\u00a0the March local elections and was elected as provincial governor. As Azuay is a major mining province, the arrival of a governor elected on his support for indigenous rights and the environment is bound to mean tensions continue. Junefield\u2019s office in Cuenca declined our requests for an interview.

Inaugurated in a ceremony that featured President Evo Morales, the plant is the first component of a two-powerhouse complex. The initial stage cost about US$140 million and was financed in large part by China. Chinese companies like Sinohydro, which was awarded a contract to complete large-scale civil works associated with the San Jose plants in 2014, stand to gain much in Bolivia, should the country maintain its power sector growth as desired by the government. The Chinese conglomerate was awarded a contract in August to construct Bolivia\u2019s 280-MW Ivirizu. Speaking at the inauguration, Morales said he wants Bolivia to generate 3,000 MW-worth of hydroelectric power by 2020, potentially allowing the country to export more than a GW of electricity to neighboring countries. San Jose 1\u2019s sister station, the 69-MW San Jose 2, is expected to be complete by the end of the year. Other notable hydropower projects currently being developed in Bolivia include the 200-MW Miguillas, 347-MW Carrizal and 120-MW Misicuni. Copyright \u00a9 2019 - 2021"

            "text": " Rucalhue hydro plant is a 90MW hydropower facility planned to be built in Chile by Atiaia Energ\u00eda Chile, the local unit of Brazilian renewables firm Atiaia Energia. Atiaia wants to build it in Biob\u00edo region (VIII), 50km south of the city of Los \u00c1ngeles. The plant would use the potential energy of water stored in a 7.2Mm3 reservoir downstream of the convergence of the Biob\u00edo and Quilme rivers. Rucalhue hydro plant would produce around 465GWh/y for Chile's central SIC grid, via a new dual circuit 220kV line, and supply approximately 143,000 people. Work on Rucalhue hydro plant is penciled in to begin at the end of 2015, according to documents filed with Chile's environmental regular SEA, which will either reject or approval the project. Construction would take an estimated 30 months and cost around US$240mn. The Chilean government wants renewable energy sources to account for a larger proportion of generation. But social opposition in the country to large-scale energy projects has made adding new large-scale hydroelectric plants exceedingly difficult in recent years, reaching a crescendo with the government's approval and subsequent rejection of the 2.75GW HidroAys\u00e9n mega-dam project in the southern region of Ays\u00e9n (XI). Twenty years ago, hydroelectricity accounted for more than 70% of Chile's installed power generation capacity. Today that share is just 37%, according to the energy ministry.

More info  Dr Jack Brown watched the interview in the US and analysed the way Prince\u00a0Harry\u00a0and Meghan\u00a0Markle\u00a0presented themselves to the camera. While he said they showed high levels of \u201cempathy\u201d and \u201csincerity\u201d, they were albeit \u201canxious\u201d. Dr Brown added that one moment - when Harry discussed healing the rift between him and Prince Charles - he detected hesitancy and deception over whether the pair were trying to get along better.\u00a0  Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC, Dr Brown explained:\u00a0 \u201cIf I could put it in a nutshell, and one of the things I teach a lot and one of the things I'm asked to assess is sincerity level of people, Harry and Meghan have a very high sincerity quotient. \u201cAnd a very high empathy quotient so I detected with one small possible exception, no deception, during the interview. \u201cThe only thing that made me think there was a little hesitancy and perhaps a little deception over Harry and Prince Charles. \u201cMaybe Harry alluded to that maybe they're patching it up and I think there's still a rift going on there. JUST IN: 'Liar & disgrace' Dr Shola EXPLODES at Piers Morgan's attack on Meghan Markle - GMB chaos          \u201cBut other than that, a significant rift and maybe they aren't talking yet, but other than that I detected no deception and with a real high degree of honesty.\" Dr Brown continued: \u201cCertainly anxiety, certainly anxiety on both of the parts, you've noticed many watchers will see how Harry fiddled with his wedding ring a lot and that's a strong sign of anxiety. \u201cAnd how Meghan was rapidly blinking, which is a nonspecific but fairly reliable indication of anxiety, not deception but just anxiety.\u201d Nick Ferrari then asked whether the doctor thought Harry and Meghan were relaxed.\u00a0 READ MORE: Kate and Meghan row: Journalist who broke rift story shares insight - who WAS crying?      He replied: \u201cNo, no, I think they were both nervous, but no deception so I don't think they were relaxed.\u201d Mr Ferrari continued on and asked Dr Brown: \u201cWhen I watch (the interview) in the UK tonight I'll be watching as a journalist, you were watching it as a body language expert.\u00a0 \u201cWere I to ask you for the highlight in your world or the moment that made you think \u2018Wow\u2019 and you actually sat back and took a sip of your tea or juice or whatever, what was that moment for you?\u201d Dr Brown replied: \u201cI think it was when there was some discussion of skin tone colour on the child. \u201cThat's what really got me and many people will look at Oprah's face.\u00a0 \u201cOprah loves the camera so I would really love the camera to be on Meghan and Harry and not Oprah and she was, you might see her jaw hanging open.

The dams in Santa Cruz province will be constructed by China Gezhouba Group Co Ltd, which holds a majority stake in the project, and Argentina\u2019s Electroingeniera SA. Together, the dams - to be named after former President Nestor Kirchner and a former regional governor - will represent 1,310 megawatts of hydroelectric capacity and produce an average of 5,171 gigawatt hours of energy, around 5 percent of the country\u2019s total electricity demand. The companies won an auction to build the dams in 2013. But President Mauricio Macri put the project on hold pending an evaluation of the cost and environmental impact after taking office in December 2015. In 2014, the China Development Bank agreed to lend Argentina $4.7 billion to finance the construction of the dams. The South American country could not tap global capital markets at the time because of disputes over unpaid debt, which were resolved last year when Macri settled with holdout creditors.

It is one of the largest ports in Mexico with nearly a million containers handled during 2016.  Blockchain has been adopted by several ports across the world to increase transparency and efficiency of operations. Use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for port operations in Mexico may help to deal with growth. In Mexico, imports have risen by 5.9 % in the first six months of 2019. That\u2019s up on the 2018 growth of 3.4 %, according to figures from the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation.  The university will support the blockchain initiative at Veracruz port by providing researchers and consultants. \u201cTecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey\u2019s national digital transformation initiative seeks to involve industry and academia in designing solutions to the challenges of the new digital economy, thereby transmitting value to society through its faculty, students and alumni,\u201d said Dr Igor Rivera, director of the Master in Finance at EGADE Business School and leader of the project. \u201cTraceability across operating and cargo transfer activities is an advantage offered by blockchain technology since every event and transaction will be recorded in a single place and visible to everyone. Precise, real-time monitoring will translate into efficiency and, above all, an increase in the level of customer service,\u201d said Genaro M\u00e9ndez, Technology Director at Grupo CICE. This is the second blockchain trial for Hutchison Ports at Veracruz Port. Last year, for the same port it ran tests with Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) and blockchain startup dexFreight. Hutchison Ports is also a participant in the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN), a blockchain consortium that boasts shippers COSCO, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd and COSCO owned OOCL. In terms of ports, apart from Hutchison, GSBN has signed up COSCO SHIPPING Ports, OOCL, Port of Qingdao, PSA International and Shanghai International Port Group. Like Hutchison, port operator PSA International is participating in multiple blockchain projects and is also involved in GBSN competitor TradeLens, from IBM and Maersk. TradeLens has more than a dozen ports as members including the Port of Halifax, Russia\u2019s St Petersburg and the Port of Rotterdam. In terms of ports around the world, the Port of Rotterdam was one of the earliest to adopt blockchain. Two months ago, Dutch bank ABN AMRO announced that it has successfully completed a Proof of Concept with the Dutch port in collaboration with Samsung SDS.

According to the indictment in the case, Hernandez, who has been president since 2014, used Honduran law enforcement and military officials to protect drug traffickers, including Fuentes Ramirez. Hernandez, who is not named in the indictment, is labelled as co-conspirator 4, though his identity is clear. The president has strongly denied the allegations. He has often represented himself as tough on drugs, claiming credit for breaking up powerful crime cartels and extraditing numerous traffickers to the United States. Hernandez\u2019s name was also mentioned in a criminal case against his brother Tony, who was convicted in Manhattan Federal Court of drug trafficking and related weapons charges in October 2019. In that trial, U.S. prosecutors said President Hernandez had accepted millions in bribes from drug traffickers. He has repeatedly denied the allegation. Hernandez was a key ally to the United States under both the Obama and the Trump administrations. The investigation will not only affect future bilateral relations but also complicate the new Biden administration\u2019s efforts to invest $4 billion in Central America, including Honduras, to address the causes of migration. In a series of tweets on Monday, Hernandez said that drug traffickers were giving false testimony against him to U.S. authorities as revenge against his government and to reduce their own sentences. He warned of possible consequences. \u201cI will maintain the international alliance in the fight against drug trafficking until the final day of my presidency,\u201d Hernandez said on Twitter. \u201cBut if drug traffickers...win benefits from the United States for false testimony, the international alliance will collapse in Honduras and then in other countries.\u201d Last month, thousands of Hondurans joined one of the largest-ever migrant caravans hoping to reach the United States, with many citing rampant violence, government corruption and worsening poverty as their reasons for leaving home. Democratic U.S. senators in late February introduced a bill that would sanction Hernandez for alleged drug trafficking and corruption and cut off financial assistance and ammunition sales to Honduran security forces. In addition to potentially shedding light on the extent of corruption and official involvement in drug trafficking in Honduras, revelations from Fuentes Ramirez\u2019s trial could affect presidential primaries taking place in Honduras this month ahead of November\u2019s election. Previous court filings in the case show that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating Hernandez and others for drug trafficking and money laundering around 2013, the year he was elected president after heading the parliament, or Congress. He was re-elected in a contested ballot in 2017 to hold office until early 2022. U.S. prosecutors in this case said in a February filing that the Honduran government has \u201chardly been forthcoming\u201d with assistance in their investigations and said the government had not honored requests to extradite potential witnesses against the president.

Evan Ellis on March 25, 2019 - 12:00am \n\tThis report is originally published at the Global Americans. \n\tFrom March 18-22, with the help of the U.S. State Department, I had the opportunity to travel to Trinidad and Tobago to speak with businessmen, academics and others regarding Chinese activities in Trinidad and Tobago.\u00a0 My visit coincided with\u00a0an important meeting on Venezuela\u00a0between President Trump and Caribbean leaders working to bring a peaceful end to the repressive Maduro regime. Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Prime Minister Keith Rowley, who strongly objects to international efforts to ensure a democratic outcome in Venezuela\u2019s spiraling crisis, was\u00a0notably not on the guest list.\u00a0 \n\tThe increasingly negative tone of the once-close relationship between the U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago coincides with an expansion of the Caribbean country\u2019s economic, political, and security relationship with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), including numerous ongoing Chinese works projects. These include a\u00a0$500 million Chinese-built drydock\u00a0and\u00a0$102 million industrial park\u00a0in La Brea, significant Chinese positions in the telecommunications sector, gifts of hundreds of police motorcycles, purchases of Chinese buses, and rumors of the PRC acquiring the defunct Petrotrin refinery in Trinidad and Tobago. While the nation is still a functioning democracy, the Rowley regime\u2019s embrace of easy Chinese money, as well as the increasingly dangerous and unpredictable regime in neighboring Venezuela, raises concerns about oil-rich Trinidad and Tobago, strategically located at the entrance of the lesser Antilles. If unchecked, China\u2019s expanding engagement in the country risks leaving a series of economic white elephants and leaving the country under a heavy debt burden. But there are steps the U.S. can take to help. \nThe PRC-Trinidad and Tobago relationship \n\tFor more than half a century, Trinidad and Tobago has been a center of Chinese attention in the Caribbean. In June 1974, it became one of the first nations of the region to diplomatically recognize the PRC. It was also one of the first to embrace multiple Chinese construction projects, including the Brian Lara cricket stadium (built by Shanghai Construction Group, initially for the 2007 cricket world cup, but not fully\u00a0completed until a decade later, in May 2017), the refurbishment of the St. James police station, the landmark\u00a0National Academy of the Performing Arts\u00a0in Port of Spain, the accompanying\u00a0Southern Academy of the Performing Arts\u00a0in San Fernando, the Shanghai Construction-built velodrome and aquatics center, the South terminal of the Piarco International Airport (renovated for the Summit of the Americas, which Trinidad and Tobago hosted in 2009), and the\u00a0Couva Children\u2019s Hospital\u00a0(whose completed shell remains unused).\u00a0 \n\tIn the energy sector, in 2011, China Investment Corporation (the PRC sovereign wealth fund), invested $850 million to acquire a 10 percent interest in Atlantic LNG.\u00a0 \n\tBeyond business dealings, the PRC established its second Confucius institute in the region at the University of the West Indies St. Augustine campus. Such institutes, of which there are currently six in the Caribbean, are the official PRC vehicle for the teaching of the Chinese language and the promotion of Chinese culture, employing PRC professors funded by the Chinese government. Trinidad and Tobago was also the first government in the region to buy a major China-built military ship. Its capital, Port of Spain, was chosen by the Chinese government to host bilateral meetings with\u00a0nine Caribbean leaders, including the country\u2019s Prime Minister, when then newly-elected President Xi Jinping traveled to the region in\u00a0June 2013. \n\tBuilding on this strong base, PRC political and business ties with Trinidad and Tobago have continued to expand over the past two decades, even with alternation in power between the country\u2019s two major political parties. Today\u2019s numerous PRC-built public buildings and other infrastructure projects are generally considered to have started with Prime Minister Patrick Manning and his People\u2019s National Movement (PNM) government (2001-2010). They continued to expand when the PNM was replaced by the United National Congress (UNC) coalition of Kamla Persad-Bissessar in 2010, and grew even more when the PNM returned to power under current Prime Minister Keith Rowley. \n\tAlthough far removed from trade routes to Asia, in May 2018, Trinidad and Tobago became one of the first nations in the Caribbean to join the PRC \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d signing a memorandum of understanding whose content and commitments were never made known, presumably to strengthen the nation\u2019s tenuous ties to Chinese markets, loans, and investments. During Prime Minister Rowley\u2019s May 2018\u00a0trip to the PRC, where he signed the agreement, he secured a commitment from the Chinese to purchase a symbolically important albeit unspecified quantity of paving material from the local Lake Asphalt corporation to\u00a0pave the runways of the new Beijing airport. \n\tSince late 2018, the pressures on the Rowley government to work with Chinese firms have grown through the closure of the Petrotrin refinery. The closure put approximately 5,200 people directly employed by the facility out of work in the vicinity of country\u2019s third major city, San Fernando, and indirectly affected thousands of others. \n\tIn the context of the government\u2019s scramble to find jobs for the thousands put out of work by the closure of Petrotrin, it has made a commitment to\u00a0China Harbour Engineering Corporation\u00a0to build a $500 million dry-dock facility in La Brea, part of the area affected by the Petrotrin closure. Although China Harbour already has a major presence throughout the Caribbean and representatives in Port of Spain, the drydock would be its first major project and opportunity to establish a foothold in the country. \n\tExpanding\u00a0engagement\u00a0and dangerous precedent \n\tAs has occurred with other governments which have hastily agreed to incur debt in contracting Chinese firms to build public works projects\u2014most famously the Sri Lankan\u00a0port of Hambantota\u2014it is not clear whether the location and other characteristics of the drydock will be sufficiently attractive for shipping companies to do major repairs at the new facility. On the other hand, the China Harbour commitment to fund 30 percent of the project\u00a0with its own resources\u00a0raises the prospect whether it has a plan in coordination with the Chinese shipping line COSCO or others to do their work there. \n\tBeyond the drydock, the Rowley government is also discussing work with Beijing Construction and Engineering Group (BCEG) (already involved in the Curepe highway interchange project), to build an industrial park, \u201cPhoenix Park Industrial Estate,\u201d at nearby Point Lisas. In exchange for the government\u2019s payment of approximately\u00a0$104 million\u00a0to BCEG to develop the site, financed by China\u2019s Import-Export Bank, BCEG has suggested that it could attract\u00a010 major PRC-based companies\u00a0to set up operations at the site, and possibly bring as many as 60 Chinese firms to the site over the long term, generating up to\u00a04,500 jobs. It is not clear, however, that after BCEG completes the work and the Trinidad and Tobago government incurs the debt, the promised Chinese investors will materialize, or whether they will require the government to grant them special tax incentives and exemptions from labor and other laws to come to the country. \n\tThe Trinidad and Tobago government has previously tried to attract Chinese industrial investments, and such attempts have ended badly. In 2008, it secured a\u00a0$400 million financing commitment\u00a0from China Ex-Im bank for the\u00a0$600 million project\u00a0to establish an aluminum smelting operation, Alutrint, and the Chinese brought on 200 workers to advance the operation. The project was\u00a0cancelled in 2010,\u00a0however, when the incoming UNC government did not find that the project complied with environmental requirements. While the Rowley government has suggested that some kind of Chinese aluminum operation\u00a0may still be possible, the Chinese have a\u00a0$100 million possible claim for damagesarising from the prior ill-fated project. \n\tIf the proposed Phoenix Park industrial park does succeed in attracting the hoped-for Chinese companies, they would likely use the nearby port of Point Lisas to import factor inputs and export products. The expanded volume of port throughput, and its use by Chinese firms, in turn, could tempt the Chinese state-owned shipping company COSCO to consider expanding the service it currently offers to Port of Spain to also make a stop in Point Lisas, competing for the new business with CMA-CGM and smaller shipping companies currently servicing the port. \n\tBeyond these two key projects, the Rowley government has also committed to contract Shanghai Construction Group (responsible for many of the previously mentioned buildings and infrastructure projects), to build a new 540-bed wing for the Port of Spain General Hospital, to replace one damaged by a recent earthquake. Work on the new wing is scheduled to begin in September 2019. Shanghai Construction is currently in the midst of constructing its new regional headquarters in Port of Spain, conveniently located next door to a U.S. Embassy residence. \n\tAs has occurred elsewhere in the Caribbean, the Trinidad and Tobago government also hoped to contract the Chinese firm HNA, or other Chinese companies, to build a 5-star, 750-bed resort in the Golden Grove area of Tobago. The project was seen as particularly important to attract tourism in the less-developed island of Tobago, where one government-built hotel, the Magdalena, has languished for years after losing its brand-sponsor, Hilton. While the Trinidad and Tobago government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the\u00a0luxury hotel brand Sandals\u00a0to guide development of the hotel, the latter decided in early 2019 to withdraw from the project,\u00a0citing negative publicity. \n\tWith respect to the petroleum sector, the shutdown of the Petrotrin refinery has also created the possibility that the government may reach out to Chinese banks to help secure $1.4 billion in loans to refinance looming bond payments for the refinery, including an $850 million bond coming due in 2019, and a $750 million bond coming due in 2021. There have also been rumors of Chinese interest in acquiring the refinery itself, which has some sophisticated capabilities, important for fully refining the heavy, high-sulfur oil produced in neighboring Venezuela. Senior oil industry executives consulted for this work could not, however, confirm that the Chinese were exploring that possibility. \n\tIn the telecommunications sector, the Chinese firm Huawei, as well as its Chinese rival ZTE, has established a strong position in the Trinidad and Tobago market. Huawei performs infrastructure work for the Irish telecommunications provider Digicel, as well as for TSTT, in which the Trinidad and Tobago government is the majority (51 percent) partner. Huawei has also been successful in selling its smartphones and other telecommunications devices in the local market. Thus, in terms of both phones and the lines that carry their data, virtually all sensitive, proprietary and personal data transmitted by Trinidad and Tobago government personnel, local and foreign businessmen, and others in the country, passes through Huawei hardware at some point in its journey. \n\tIn the transportation sector, beyond the COSCO shipping service to Port of Spain, and the 2009 modernization of the Piarco airport, the government and Caribbean Airlines have signed\u00a0a cooperation agreement\u00a0with China\u2019s Hainan Airlines, which would make Trinidad and Tobago more accessible from the PRC for Chinese officials, businessmen, and tourists. \n\tWith respect to consumer products, the Chinese automobile and truck company Great Wall has long had a presence in the country, while auto and truck makers Foton and JAC have, more recently, established very large facilities south of Port of Spain. Despite such advances, however, Chinese cars and trucks have not yet begun appearing on the streets of the country in significant numbers. In parallel, the Chinese bus manufacturer Higer has sold a\u00a0limited number of vehicles\u00a0to Trinidad and Tobago, with an order for\u00a0300 more Higer busesreportedly in the works. \n\tIn the defense and security sector, the Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force was the first in all of the Western Hemisphere to purchase a Chinese-made military ship, an\u00a0Offshore Patrol Vessel. In November 2018, the Trinidad and Tobago Police Force received a gift of 250 Chinese motorcycles, although it is unclear where or how they are being used. \n\tGrowing PRC-Trinidad and Tobago state-to-state and business ties are affected by the sizeable ethnic Chinese community whose roots in the country go back\u00a0more than a century. As with elsewhere in the Caribbean, that community is generally respected, but has limited engagement with other components of Trinidad and Tobago society beyond the contact with the non-Chinese community through its restaurants and shops, known for their long operating hours and reasonable prices. Indeed, a public event that I attended in San Fernando, sponsored by the local Chamber of Commerce, was not attended by a single businessman of Chinese descent, even though Chinese Trinidadians reportedly make up approximately 20 percent of the greater San Fernando population. \n\tAs has occurred elsewhere in the Caribbean, the importation of Chinese workers by PRC-based construction companies on temporary work visas to support their projects appears to have contributed to a substantial increase in the number of Chinese in the country, with many incorporated into relatively enclosed Chinese communities into which the Trinidad and Tobago authorities have almost no visibility. Trinidad and Tobago-based analysts with whom I spoke during this and prior visits expressed concern over gambling and other illicit activities that occur in some Chinese establishments. Illicit activities within the Trinidad and Tobago Chinese community also include extra-official versions of the national lottery draw game Play Whe (with money collected by, and paid out of Chinese shops without paying the associated national taxes), as well as the character-based Chinese game-of-chance \u201cWei Wei.\u201d Some consulted for this work suggest that such gambling plays an important role in laundering money (particularly U.S. dollars). Perhaps even more troubling, the February 2019 discovery of a prostitution ring involving\u00a019 Venezuelan womenrun out of a high-end Chinese establishment suggests that\u00a0Chinese criminal groups, previously isolated from non-Chinese Trinidadian society, may be entering new areas of illicit business, such as the exploitation of the estimated 60,000 Venezuelan refugees currently in the country, through prostitution and other activities. \nImplications for the U.S.\u00a0 \n\tTrinidad and Tobago\u2019s deepening engagement with the PRC needs to be on the radar of U.S. policymakers in Washington, particularly as the incumbent Rowley government engages in increasingly bombastic rhetoric and positions increasingly unhelpful to the maintenance of security and rule of law in the region\u2014particularly the Maduro regime and its associated criminal actors and armed groups in Venezuela.\u00a0 \n\tIt would be fruitless and counterproductive for the U.S. to prevent Trinidad and Tobago or other countries from doing business with the PRC. The U.S. can, however, expand the attention given to this strategically important Caribbean country. The U.S. can also help strengthen the country\u2019s capacity to negotiate effectively with the Chinese (and others), and to make smart and financially well-grounded decisions that help the Trinidad and Tobago government leverage the opportunities that loans and investment from and China and others can provide, to ensure that the projects contracted most effectively advance national development objectives.\u00a0 \n\tU.S. help, if respectfully offered and accepted by the Rowley government, could include expanded support for programs to help the country most rationally plan a logical series of investments, grounded in sound business cases and objective value analysis. The U.S. government can also expand programs to help the Trinidad and Tobago government more effectively conduct open competitive procurement, including the evaluation of the legal and technical aspects of proposals and contracts by Chinese and other companies. \n\tBeyond such initiatives, the U.S. should continue to encourage the Trinidad and Tobago government to maintain transparency in its negotiations, to ensure that the terms of the deals that it makes reflect the best interests of the people of the country, without side benefits to persons affiliated with the negotiators. The U.S. can strengthen the capabilities of the Trinidad and Tobago government to monitor compliance with the agreements achieved, including the greatest possible number of jobs for residents of the country, adherence to national labor laws, and compliance with environmental regulations and the technical terms of agreements to ensure that the performance of the contract produces the expected benefits to the country. \n\tFinally, at the political level, the U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago may wish to consider a reset of their increasingly tense relationship.\u00a0 A visit to the country by senior U.S. officials such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, or U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, accompanied by respectful, but frank dialogue, could be an effective way to start. \n\tThe U.S. is not only strongly connected to Trinidad and Tobago by ties of geography, commerce and family; it has been a close partner to the country for far too long for the relationship to degenerate through escalating populist rhetoric and recriminations that might push Trinidad and Tobago to deepen its embrace of the PRC in ways that would neither be beneficial to the United States, nor for the people of Trinidad and Tobago. \n\t\u00a0 Sign up for our newsletter\u2014stay up-to-date with upcoming Panels, the latest Pulse, and more. \nSign up\u00a0for our newsletter\u2014stay up-to-date with upcoming Panels, the latest Pulse, and more. \n\tEconVue is a platform for independent economic experts offering individual insights into key markets around the world.\u00a0Our contributors are the best in their fields, passionate about their subject matter, and singular in their track records. \n"

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 2 Min Read JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Cyprus, Greece and Israel on Monday signed an initial agreement to build the world\u2019s longest and deepest underwater power cable that will traverse the Mediterranean seabed at a cost of about $900 million and link their electricity grids. The project, called the Euro-Asia interconnector, will provide a back-up power source in times of emergency, said Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, who was in Nicosia to sign a memorandum of understanding with his counterparts. Cypriot Energy Minister Natasa Pilides said it marked \u201ca decisive step towards ending the island\u2019s energy isolation, and consequently, our dependence on heavy fuels.\u201d The cable will have a capacity of 1,000-2,000 megawatts (MW) and is expected to be completed by 2024, according to Israel\u2019s energy ministry. With a length of about 1,500 km and a maximum depth of 2,700 metres, it will be the longest and deepest subsea electricity cable to have ever been constructed, it said. Calling the project a \u20182,000 mega-watt highway\u2019, Pilides said the first stage is expected to be operational within 2025. It will cover three sections of the Mediterranean: some 310 kilometres between Israel and Cyprus, about 900 kilometres between Cyprus and Crete, and about 310 additional kilometres between Crete and mainland Greece. Greek power grid operator IPTO has started construction of the Crete-mainland part, seen concluding by 2023. The Greek operator and Eurasia have been working closely to make sure the two cables link to each other efficiently, an IPTO official said. The European Union has recognised the cable as a \u201cProject of Common Interest\u201d, categorising it as a project it is willing to partly finance.

Dr. Al Hamad explained that it is the responsibility of children and family members of elderly relatives to support them to get vaccinated. \u201cNow that we have approved and effective vaccines, elderly people have the opportunity to become protected and live free from the threat of this virus. I ask anyone with elderly relatives who are not yet vaccinated to support your elderly mother, father and loves ones to get vaccinated and get protected. Please ensure they understand that the vaccines are safe, and more than 327,000 doses have been safety administered to the most vulnerable people in Qatar.\u201d\u00a0 Dr. Al Hamad highlighted that older people have a significantly increased risk from COVID-19. \u201cPeople over 60 years of age are more likely to get sick, more likely to need medical treatment, more likely to require admission to ICU and, sadly, more at risk of dying as a result of severe complications from COVID-19.\u201d \u201cThe National COVID-19 Vaccination Program is now moving at pace and it is pleasing to know that more than half of Qatar\u2019s elderly population have now received at least one dose of the vaccine, with 61 percent of people over 70 years of age and 55 percent of people over 60 years of age having received at least one vaccine dose,\u201d added Dr. Al Hamad. Dr. Al Hamad said that getting vaccinated is easy: vaccines are available in all 27 primary health centers and HMC homecare teams are vaccinating housebound patients in the safety and comfort of their own homes. She said anyone over 60 years of age should call Primary Health Care Corporation on 4027 7077 to book a vaccination appointment at a primary health center. \u00a008 Mar 2021 - 15:02 Qatargas Operating Company Limited (Qatargas) today announced completion of its North Field Bravo (NFB) Living Quarters Expansion project which provides an additional 90-person accommodation facility to the NFB Offshore Operations.\u00a0 \u00a008 Mar 2021 - 13:51 Woqod has opened a new FAHES mobile station located in Sealine, near Al Meera. \u00a008 Mar 2021 - 13:03 Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) today reported 468 new cases of coronavirus (Covid-19) and 298 people recovered from the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people recovered in Qatar to 156,299 Strengthening public participation \nQatar calls for elimination of nuclear and mass...  \nQatar and Jordan keen to strengthen fraternal...  \nCOVID-19 pandemic highlights importance of...  \nQatar wants to strengthen constructive ties with...  \nPHCC calls for rejecting all forms of violence  \nMontreal Protocol: Keeping us, our food and...  \nPlacing mental health at forefront of global...  \nQatar renews commitment to providing necessary...  \nClimate change is the defining crisis of our time  \nDon\u2019t blame Pakistan for the outcome of the war...  \n\u00a009 Oct 2021 - 19:07\n \n\u00a009 Oct 2021 - 17:10\n \n\u00a013 Oct 2021 - 13:26\n \n\u00a015 Oct 2021 - 22:09\n \n\u00a015 Oct 2021 - 22:05\n \n\u00a015 Oct 2021 - 21:55\n Darb Al Saai activities cancelled for Qatar National Day 2021 Tickets sales for first Qatar F1 race to start on Tuesday Philippines eases capital\u2019s curbs, allows quarantine-free entry India reopens for foreign tourists as virus infections ebb Don't just talk - act on climate, Queen Elizabeth signals to world leaders Canada's Trudeau to recall parliament late Nov., opposition say he is wasting time The Peninsula newspaper provides extensive news coverage, incisive analyses and trenchant commentary from around the world, but with firm roots and primary focus on life in Qatar."

Cecilia\u2019ed \u00a9 Indu Antony A long time has passed since that 28 of February 1909, when the first National Women Day was celebrated by the Socialist Party of America in the city of New York. It took several decades until feminist movements first, and the United Nations later adopted it in 1967 and 1977 respectively. Its importance has grown over years and generations and today International Women Day represents a moment to celebrate womanhood and remember relevant social reforms. For us, at PHmuseum the 8th of March is also on occasion to bring ahead the discussion about gender inequality in our industry and share with our community the work of female artists who are challenging the medium and offering their perspective on relevant issues. This year we got in touch with Maria Kapajeva the co-founder of Fast Forward - a research project concerned with women in photography based at University for the Creative Arts (UK) - who recommended us the work of these practitioners.  - I. Angieszka Sejud (Poland) - The first time I came across Sejud\u2019s work - says Maria - it was via her book Hoax, which was later shortlisted for the Aperture First Photobook Award in 2020. I was excited by her free style in deconstructing and collaging images to address the issues of politics within mass media imagery. Grabbing the attention of the audience with vivid colours and collaged absurdity, Sejud raises questions on difficult to unpack matters such as the oppressions of human rights within the current rhetoric of far-right politicians and the Catholic Church authorities in Poland and beyond.   II. Eman Ali (Oman/Bahrain) - I came across the work by Eman Ali for the first time last year for a take over of Fast Forward Instagram @womeninphoto, which I lead. One of her recent works Utendi is an artistic attempt to look at women\u2019s positions in today\u2019s world with references to histories and text from ancient civilisations. As in her previous work, Her Holeyness, Ali explores a rooted concept of female virginity. She mixes the aesthetics of commercial photography with historical and cultural references while creating new visual narratives to ask uneasy questions.   III. Etinosa Yvonne (Nigeria) - I met Etinosa in 2018 via the Fast Forward mentorship program for West African emerging photographers, supported by British Council West Africa. Since then, her documentary practice has been shaped with clear political and social messaging surrounding injustice and lack of representation of those who have no voice. Her recent work It\u2019s All in My Head is a conceptual project, which brings attention to the voices of survivors of terrorism. In addition, this work opens up a discussion on their coping mechanisms, which they share with the audience. In this project, Yvonne raises important questions surrounding the recovery journey and the struggle these people face as well as addresses the great need for accessible care and support for survivors of terrorism.   IV. Indu Antony (India) - I have known Antony\u2019s work for many years, and I admire what she does as an artist and an activist. Based in Bangalore, she recently initiated a social project Cecilia\u2019ed which aims to bring awareness to \u2018safety\u2019 norms in public spaces for women. Her recent self-published artist book Why can\u2019t bra\u2019s have buttons, a beautiful hand-made box of prints, is a collection of object-based memories of the artist, where each object has been sewn by a single strand of the artist\u2019s hair. This book was selected as one of Fast Forward Photobooks of the Year, nominated by Rahaab Allana, Curator at Alkazi Foundation for the Arts.   V. Karolina \u0106wik (Poland) - \u0106wik is an honest and exciting artist, who talks about motherhood as part of her unavoidable reality, where love and frustration meet on a daily basis. Her recent work Let\u2019s build the virus is a genuine document of what families with children are going through now around the globe while being locked down at homes for nearly a year.   VI. Ksenia Halubovich (Belarus) - Halubovich is one of the brightest photographic voices in the current Belarusian protests. Like many other photographers in the country, despite the threat of arrest, she continues to document the events as they develop. In her earlier works, she focused on various difficult social issues, which are often uneasy to talk about, such as the lives of people in a psychoneurological orphanage or with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.   VII. Maika Elan (Vietnam) - When I look at the images of Elan in her work, The Pink Choice, I see a kind of banality and routine of daily life, to which I can easily relate. This is what I like about her work, there is a beauty in everydayness. It is important to see underrepresented members of our society not just in dramatic fights for their rights, but also as people who have the same problems, feelings and needs as any other people. This kind of work is about the empathy of one human toward another, which we really need more than ever nowadays.   VIII. Mano Svanidze (Georgia) - Svanidze\u2019s language is rather intimate, one full of scratches and dust left on the films she photographs with. She uses photography as her way to talk about personal fears and doubts, invisible struggles of her own and others, who are forcefully marginalised. Her two most recent works Dormiveglia and Feeling blue address a current state of uncertainty escalated by the global pandemic.   IX. Marilene Ribeiro (Brazil) - Ribeiro recently received her PhD from University for the Creative Arts where she developed her most recent body of work Dead Water. The work includes brave and complex research on hydroelectrical processes in Brazil. Working collaboratively with members from traditional communities, Ribeiro gives voices to those whose lives were drastically affected by the construction of dams in rural areas.   X. Masha Svyatogor (Belarus) - Svyatogor works in collages using official Soviet archival images, referencing Constructivist aesthetics with a contemporary twist. Within the recent protests, led by incredible women in Belarus, her work links together the Soviet past of the country with the current regime and protests against it. I can see how her work can be easily used as posters at these protests, as well as exhibiting pieces in a gallery space.   XI. Nadine Al Koudsi ( Emirates) - The work Those Who Dance on the Staircase by Al Koudsi is a wonderful attempt to talk about the nostalgia of Syrians who live in Lebanon. This work is tightly interwoven with the complexities of their migration reality. People, who were forced to move out from their home country, often are pictured as just victims of the consequences. But in Al Koudsi\u2019s work, we see a rather complex mosaic of various voices, stories, portraits and places, which creates a powerful tool for feeling empathy for someone who you do not know but can relate to.   XII. Thandiwe Msebenzi (South Africa) - I came across the work Phantsi kwebhedu ka Gogo by Msebenzi a couple of years ago and I was happy to include the incredibly powerful story behind this work in my ongoing online curatorial project One Image Story. The more recent work Qgwashu Qgwashulooks at the complexity of violent masculinity as the rooted culture in our society. Msebenzi is definitely a strong voice in South African photography, who raises uneasy questions and provokes discussion about difficult matters such as domestic violence, rape and sexual harassment.  --- Maria Kapajeva is an artist, who works between Estonia and London. Her work often highlights peripheral histories, focusing on the representation of women. Her recent book Dream is Wonderful, Yet Unclear was published by Milda Books in 2020. Her solo exhibition When The World Blows Up, I Hope To Go Down Dancing is currently up at the Finnish Museum of Photography. Together with her practice, Kapajeva works as Project Manager and Researcher for Fast Forward: Women in Photography project.  Fast Forward is a research project concerned with women in photography based at University for the Creative Arts. Started in 2014, the project has established significance within the world of photography for highlighting the work of women photographers and for questioning the way that the established canons have been formed. Fast Forward is designed to promote and engage with women in photography across the globe. We intend to provoke new debate and ensure that we are in the news and in the history books. There are millions of women in the world of photography and now is the time to arrest the process of forgetting that so frequently erases women from the burgeoning histories of photography and sheds light on new ways of thinking, showing, discussing, and distributing our work. --- This article is part of the work we have started in the last few years to support gender equality and promote underrepresented photographers. A work that has included initiatives such as the WP Grant, or online exhibitions in partnership with IWMF or MFON. We're always working to improve our knowledge of projects from under-represented photographers in the industry.

            "text": "  A man who claimed he was kidnapped and forced to smuggle heroin to Bermuda argued his sentence should be reduced because he pleaded not guilty to the offence because of bad legal advice. Omar Davy, 40, was sentenced to 18 years in jail after he was found guilty of the importation of $765,700 worth of heroin on a flight from Toronto in 2018. But Elizabeth Christopher, who represented Davy at the Court of Appeal on Thursday, said he would have pleaded guilty \u201chad he known he had no defence\u201d. Ms Christopher said: \u201cHad Davy understood the law \u2013 which I think is very, very clear with respect to the defence of duress in this jurisdiction \u2013 he would not have persisted in his not guilty plea.\u201d Davy, from Mandeville, Jamaica, was arrested on July 10, 2018 after he was stopped for a secondary search at the airport. Officers searched his luggage but, before he was given a body search, he ran from the airport. CCTV footage from the customs area caught Davy take a package of heroin out of his pants and put it inside his already-searched luggage before he bolted. Davy later claimed at his trial that the night before he was scheduled to fly to Bermuda he had been abducted in Toronto over a $24,000 debt to a Jamaican \u201cdon\u201d. He claimed he was choked unconscious and beaten until he agreed to take a package and that his attackers also threatened his family in Jamaica. But a Supreme Court jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict after just 30 minutes of deliberation. Ms Christopher said Davy had very limited communication with his first lawyer, Susan Mulligan, about the case, or with his second lawyer, Charles Richardson. Another lawyer, Archibald Warner, stepped in to represent Davy only days before the trial started after the defendant rejected legal advice from Mr Richardson. Ms Christopher said he should have been told that under Bermudian law his story did not amount to duress and could not succeed. She said Davy had told the court he agreed to take the drugs because of threats to his family in Jamaica. But threats would only count as duress if the family members were present when the threat was made in Bermudian law. Ms Christopher added: \u201cI think he honestly felt he had a leg to stand on with this defence.\u201d She argued that Davy should get a reduced sentence because, if he had been properly advised, he would have pleaded guilty and got a shorter jail term. Ms Christopher added that the Supreme Court had wrongly taken the unanimous verdict as a rejection of Davy\u2019s story, rather than a view that the story did not amount to a legal defence. But Alan Richards, for the Crown, said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that none of the lawyers had warned Davy that the defence he used was \u201cdifficult\u201d. He added that the alleged threats against Davy\u2019s family would not amount to duress in a legal sense, but the alleged threats against Davy would have been \u2013 if the jury believed his \u201cfantastical\u201d story. Mr Richards said that Davy\u2019s version of events was rejected by the jury. He added: \u201cThere was no evidence to corroborate any of the appellant\u2019s assertions supporting his purported defence of duress. \u201cDespite this substantial beating he said he had received only the night before, no injuries were detected and he managed to sprint across the airport car park and evade capture.\u201d Mr Richards said the defendant had an uphill battle to prove that his actions were \u201cnecessary\u201d to escape violence \u2013 which the Crown had disputed \u2013 but the defence was still open to Davy. He added: \u201cIt may not have been a strong case, the facts supporting it may have been incredible, but that was not Mr Warner\u2019s fault. That was the defendant\u2019s fault. \u201cIt\u2019s the defendant that ultimately has to accept responsibility for his plea, which was not one of guilty.\u201d He added that Davy had also claimed he did not know what the contents of the package were \u2013 another legal defence that the jury rejected. Mr Richards said: \u201cTo suggest that Mr Davy only had a trial because Mr Warner didn\u2019t understand duress is preposterous. \u201cMr Davy wasn\u2019t only running duress. He was also running knowledge.\u201d A judgment will be released later. \u2022It is The Royal Gazette\u2019s policy not to allow comments on stories regarding court cases.

            "text": " WITH a supplier\u2019s credit in the sum of US$3.6M already secured from Chongqing Water Turbine Works Co., Tumatumari Hydro Inc. is putting plans in motion to commence the rehabilitation of the Tumatumari Hydropower Station on the Potaro River, Region Eight.\nIn an interview with the Guyana Chronicle on Saturday, Tumatumari Hydro Inc. Director and Corporate Secretary, Lloyd Rose said the project is expected to cost US$4.6M while noting that the financing structure comprises two components \u2013 Equity Capital and Debt Capital. \u201cIn relation to the debt capital, we have acquired already by virtue of a contract for the engineering, procurement and construction for the new equipment and that comes along with supplier\u2019s credit in the amount of US$3.6M,\u201d Rose told this newspaper. That contract was signed between Tumatumari Hydro Inc., a private sector special purpose company established in 2010, and Chongqing Water Turbine Works Co. on May 26, 2018. Chongqing Water Turbine Works Co. manufactures hydropower equipment. It was founded in 1981 and is based in Chongqing, China. The US$1M equity capital has not been acquired; however, Rose assured that the Tumatumari Hydro Inc. is in the process of securing the finance. The company has since reached out to the government. \u201cWe have indicated to the government where we are and we have invited the Government to see the options there might be to support the initiative, and so we have invited them,\u201d Rose said. The multimillion-dollar rehabilitation project is expected to commence early 2019 once the required funds are secured. \u201cThe scope of the project is the full rehabilitation of the existing plant which will take the form of the complete replacement of all the electromechanical equipment resulting with the new capacity of two units of 1.1 megawatts each,\u201d he explained.\nOnce the project is completed, the special purpose company, which was designed to rehabilitate, operate and maintain the supply services, will sell bulk energy to Mahdia Power and Light Incorporated and Troy Resources Guyana Inc. ACQUIRING LICENSE\nTumatumari Hydro Inc. had acquired the rights to the area housing the now defunct hydropower station, and is now in the process of acquiring a license to operate the new facility. \u201cUnder the law we have to acquire a license to own and operate a hydroelectric facility and we are well on our way to acquiring that license to do so in the context of the law,\u201d Rose said. In 2017, the hydropower company submitted an application to the Environ-mental Protection Agency (EPA) for the rehabilitation of the Tumatumari Hydropower Station.\nAccording to an EPA advertisement published in Thursday\u2019s edition of the Stabroek News, THI has submitted an application for environmental authorisation to undertake the rehabilitation of the Hydroelectric Power Generation Plant, located on the Tumatumari, Potaro River, Region Eight. Last Thursday, while addressing hundreds of residents during a ceremony held to mark the declaration of Mahdia as a town, President David Granger reminded the residents of the capital town\u2019s energy potential. \u201cYou have the possibility of generating energy and I would like to support the minister of communities in his thrust to reactivate the Tumatumari Power Station, that eventually you will be able to get cheaper power, but even so you can get solar power, wind power, and that solar power or wind power or water power can help to drive small industries, household industries\u2026,\u201d the President said. Minister of Communities Ronald Bulkan said government is cognisant of the challenges Tumatumari Hydro Inc. is facing in acquiring the equity capital. IN NEGOTIATION\nAccording to Minister Bulkan, the government is in discussion and negotiation with Tumatumari Hydro Inc., noting that the government will try as far as possible to accommodate the company on the basis of the benefits of the project to the people of Mahdia and neighbouring communities. \u201cWe recognise the benefits if we can have hydro power \u2013 hydro power is \u201cgreen\u201d power, it is clean power, it would be cheaper power, the cost to consumers in Mahdia would be about half of the current tariff. Currently, the tariff is about close to a $100 a kilowatt hour. It would be halved; it would be continuous and reliable,\u201d Minister Bulkan said. Discussions are ongoing with the Ministry of Public Infrastructure. The Tumatumari Hydropower Station was the first hydropower station to be constructed on the Potaro River. The plant was constructed in 1957 by the British Goldfields Limited and operated until 1959 when the mining operations ceased. In 1969, the then government re-commissioned the station where the power was transmitted to serve the Guyana National Service camps at Tumatumari and Konawaruk. The development included an embankment dam, a concrete overflow dam, and a two-unit powerhouse with an installed capacity of 1500 kw, using 2 X 750 kw Francis turbines. Tumatumari Hydro Inc. and Hydro Quebec International signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the development of this hydro station and were looking for a developer to complete its final works. Several MoUs were signed with various companies for the development of the Tumatumari Hydropower Project. However, all have since expired. Rose is optimistic that this time around the project will materialise. Lama Avenue,\nBel Air Park,\nGeorgetown,\nGuyana.

Share your email for news, gossip and more Rachel Stevens was just 19 when she joined S Club 7 in 1999, and was immediately branded the 'hot one'. As well as being a lad's mag favourite, she sold 16 million record with the group before their split in 2003 and went on to release two solo albums. And back in the day, the London-born star was as famous for her music as she was for her romance with Holby City actor, Jeremy Edwards.  The handsome couple were the Mark Wright and Michelle Keegan of their day and their relationship moved fast.  Jeremy popped the question after just 18 months of dating on Valentine's Day 2002 during dinner at London's swish hotel, The Dorchester. Rachel - who'd fancied Jeremy since she first clapped eyes on him as Kurt Benson in Hollyoaks - immediately said yes. \"I really didn't have a clue he was going to do it and am thrilled to pieces,\" the then 23-year-old star gushed. \"We are both so happy.\" But Rachel's demanding schedule with S Club meant there was little time for a wedding, and Jeremy shared his frustrations, telling heat magazine, \"It's impossible.\"  Jeremy's life was then turned upside down by the tragic death of his Holby co-star, Laura Sadler, who plunged 40 ft to her death from a balcony while watching the sun rise at her boyfriend's home in Holland Park, London.  The 22-year-old actress sustained massive head injuries and died in hospital five days later, leaving Jeremy, then 31, bereft. \"Everybody in the cast is completely devastated and is asking the same question, 'Why her?'\" he told the BBC. \"You couldn\u2019t meet a sweeter, nicer, more wonderful girl. She was the kindest person and even actor friends of mine who did just one episode with her are mortified. She was just the loveliest little thing.\" Crippled with grief, he turned to alcohol which he said put a strain on their relationship. \"It was a tough time for me. After Laura's death I got really messed up. I was drinking a hell of a lot and got seriously depressed,\" he told heat. \"It really shook me up. Losing such a close friend pushed me off the rails and sadly Rachel got caught up in my mess. \"It was at this point she confronted me about my problems and we agreed to have a break.\" The pair didn't speak for an entire month until Jeremy \"realised what my behaviour was making me lose,\" and urged her to give their relationship another go. \"Rachel means the world to me. I needed a serious reality check and that's what I got,\" he added. However, plans for a wedding were put on the back-burner with Jeremy stating he needed to 'grow up a bit'.  Then in January 2004, the pair confirmed they had parted ways for good, explaining that although the decision was 'sad', it was 'the right one'.  Two years later, Rachel suddenly disappeared from the spotlight. Her second album had peaked at number 28 in the charts, but plans for a third were shelved and the star went to ground.  She resurfaced in 2008 to compete in Strictly Come Dancing with Vincent Simone, and the following year she married childhood friend Alex Bourne in a lavish ceremony at Claridge's hotel in London's Mayfair in 2009.  The couple have two daughters - Amelie, 10, and Minnie, six, and moved last year into a stunning detached North London home which Rachel regularly shares pictures of online. Fans are repeatedly admiring the fact the 42 year old looks as youthful now as she did in her twenties. And while there is no suggestion she has had surgery, the naturally pretty star has said she would be open to it in the future. \"Plastic surgery is great if you want it,\" she previously told The Sun. \"It\u2019s such a personal choice. It\u2019s great people can have the opportunity. I haven\u2019t thought about surgery now, but who knows further down the line? I don\u2019t rule it out for when I\u2019m older.\" Meanwhile, Rachel reunited with S Club 7 for a tour in 2015 and has said 'never say never' when it comes to getting the band back together. But for now, her main focus is on becoming a fashion and lifestyle influencer with an eye on launching her own brand. She told the Daily Mail: \"My first proper job was in fashion, but at lunchtimes I\u2019d nip into the canteen at Sony Music for a free meal, because my brother worked there. \"One day, two producers came over and asked me if I could sing\u2026 [Now] my goal is to create my own fashion and lifestyle brand.\"  Who was your favourite member of S Club 7 and would you like to see them reunite?

Con estas dos infraestructuras que son parte de la Red Vial Estatal E-384, el Ministerio de Transporte y Obras P\u00fablicas (MTOP) promueve la reactivaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y productiva de importantes sectores de Manab\u00ed, como las poblaciones de Jun\u00edn, Calceta y Chone, enfatiz\u00f3 Iv\u00e1n Ganchozo, subsecretario Zonal 4. Agreg\u00f3 que el puente de Canuto tendr\u00e1 40 metros de longitud y el de Pimpiguas\u00ed 30 metros de longitud.  En Canuto se prev\u00e9 la hincada de 92 pilotes de 24,9 metros, en el lecho del r\u00edo Grande para lo cual  se asign\u00f3 dos excavadoras, dos volquetes, dos gr\u00faas, un mixer, personal t\u00e9cnico, conductores y operadores que trabajan 24/7.  En Pimpiguas\u00ed el hincado de 100 pilotes de 15,60 metros, sobre el lecho del r\u00edo Chico, tiene asignado una excavadora, una retroexcavadora, dos volquetes, una gr\u00faa, un mixer y el personal t\u00e9cnico, conductores y operarios. La inversi\u00f3n del Gobierno Nacional en las dos obras es de USD 5 millones, y est\u00e1 contratada con el consorcio China Road And Bridge Corporation (CRBC) \u2013 China NationalElectronicsImport&Export (CEIEC). El trabajo de los puentes implic\u00f3 el desmontaje de la estructura met\u00e1lica, previo a la construcci\u00f3n del puente Canuto, y el derrocamiento del puente de hormig\u00f3n de Pimpiguas\u00ed, en la misma RVE.  El MTOP contrat\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n de varias obras mediante contrato multimodal. Este contrato multimodal financiado por el Gobierno Nacional, a trav\u00e9s de la Secretar\u00eda de la Reconstrucci\u00f3n con el Eximbank de China,  tambi\u00e9n prev\u00e9 la edificaci\u00f3n del puente Las Golondrinas en Esmeraldas y los trabajos para la rehabilitaci\u00f3n del Aeropuerto de Manta, con una inversi\u00f3n total de USD 60 millones.   \u201cEstas obras son un compromiso presidencial con Manab\u00ed\u201d, asegur\u00f3 Ganchozo. La estructura anterior del puente Pimpiguas\u00ed generaba un represamiento que ocasionaba inundaciones en la zona. El estudio permiti\u00f3 que se eleve a 2,60 metros y el r\u00edo tenga su cauce normal. Para ejecutar los trabajos de demolici\u00f3n, se habilit\u00f3 el paso provisional considerando todas las medidas de seguridad. La obra va de acuerdo a la programaci\u00f3n y tiene un avance del 30%.  Se recomienda a los usuarios viales tener precauci\u00f3n al circular por el sector. No obstante, se colocaron reductores de velocidad (resaltos) para evitar el exceso de velocidad.

            "text": " Chinese ambassador Song Yumin and Minister of Foreign and Caricom Affairs Dennis Moses have signed a framework agreement for a concessional loan between the governments for the development of Phoenix Park Industrial Estate. The agreement was signed yesterday at the ministry at the International Waterfront Complex. Trade Minister Paula Gopee-Scoon gave the value of the loan as USD104 million. On the time frame for repayment, interest rate, and terms and conditions of the loan, Gopee-Scoon said: \u201cThat is still amateur for the Ministry of Finance in their negotiations with the China Exim Bank.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s a concessional loan, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s at a very low interest rate, but it is a matter for the Ministry of Finance in their negotiations.\u201d She said at least 1,000 people will be employed in the construction stage, and when the entire park is filled, some 5,000 people will get jobs there. \u201cThere are already interested parties from China, TT, and we do have an anchor tenant from Latin America,\u201d said Gopee-Scoon. \u201cWe have completed our prospectus and InvesTT, (an arm of her ministry) will be going to China to meet with Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG) and our mission in China, where they will further market the park.\u201d This visit takes place in the third week in November. Moses commended the Chinese for their continued assistance and support for TT\u2019s development goals. He said: \u201cTo date, over 65 agreements have been concluded between our nations, and is a testament to our long-standing friendly relations.\u201d Moses added all such agreements signed in the past represented significant milestones, such as those for the National Academy for the Performing Arts, north and south, the national sporting facilities, the Couva Hospital and the acquisition of the multi-purpose patrol vessel used by the Coast Guard. In the case of the industrial park, he said several tenants from central America have already been identified to start business operation in air-conditioning, automotive, heavy machinery, building transmutation and furniture. He said, \u201cThis type of project truly embodies the spirit of the Belt and Road.\u201d The Belt and Road a global development strategy followed by the Chinese government. Yumin said the occasion was another highlight moment in economic co-operation between the two countries, and there will be many more projects to come, geared towards economic diversity and economic transformation in TT. He said since the Prime Minister\u2019s visit to China last year, relations have taken on a new level, and thanked the PM for his care and attention to co-operation between the two countries. Minister of Finance Colm Imbert said of the project: \u201cWe always talk of diversification. This is diversification in its purest sense, and I think it will be a huge success that will generate exports and much-needed foreign exchange for TT.\u201d\n"

Edited by Rob Corp and Paul Gribben All times stated are UK Thanks for reading today's live updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and across the globe. Today's updates were brought to you by Hamish Mackay, John Harrison, Alice Evans and Jennifer Scott. The editors were Rob Corp and Paul Gribben. Thanks for joining us. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic until tomorrow. But before we do, here's a re-cap of today's main headlines: Nick Triggle Health Correspondent In the Covid briefing, the prime minister talked about a\n\u201cbig budget of risk\u201d from opening schools, adding transmission will inevitably\nrise. While children are at incredibly low risk and evidence\nsuggests they are less susceptible to infection and transmit less - certainly\nyounger children - having millions mixing in school will of course lead to some\nspread. Schools, after all, are not islands. Children go home and mix with\ntheir families. During the November lockdown cases fell despite schools\nbeing open.  But modelling forecasts that may not be the case this time.\nThat is because of the new more contagious UK variant has become dominant since\nthen. Experts say this could push the R number above one, leading a growth in\ncases. But the bigger question is whether this matters. With the\nrollout of the vaccination programme \u2013 nearly half of adults have received\ntheir first dose \u2013 the link between infection rates and serious illness has\nbegun to be broken. There are though still vulnerable people who are yet to be\nvaccinated or are only just building up their immunity following a vaccination. This is why there is a delicate balance to be struck. Some\nrise can be tolerated, but not too much. Many travel businesses continue to be \"excluded\" from government support despite not trading for almost a year due to Covid, according to an industry trade body. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says tour operators, online travel companies and home-based workers are not eligible for government grants. As uncertainty over testing regimes and quarantine continues to hit bookings, ABTA is calling on the government to make support available for all travel businesses that have been forced to shut due to the pandemic.  A number of travel firms have fallen into administration in the last year. In Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget last week, the government extended the furlough scheme, business rates relief and VAT reductions. It also extended grants for struggling retail businesses. But ABTA says: \"We urge the government to... make grants available to all travel businesses, not just those with retail premises, recognising that the reopening of overseas travel will come later than the other sectors and will likely be gradual.\" Read the full story here. A 12-year-old boy's lockdown art project has raised about \u00a3100,000 for charity, after 250 artists came forward to help him. Noah, who has hydrocephalus, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, began painting on cardboard at home in Dedham, Essex, a year ago. His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures. They were displayed in a gallery before being auctioned for the Colchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity. Mr Jones sent the backgrounds that his son created to the artists, who finished them and posted them back. More than 200 pieces were then auctioned on eBay and raised more than \u00a380,000, with the rest made up from book sales featuring the art and donations. Noah's father Nathan Jones says they had originally hoped to raise \u00a3500 and are \"absolutely stunned\" by the total. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if\nmore money would be made available to help people deal with the financial\nimpact of having to self-isolate. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing in addition to helping people to self-isolate - in addition to the \u00a3500 support and all the rest of it\n- is giving money to councils. I have a figure of \u00a3170m in my head to help\nthem give people who really need it help to self-isolate,\u201d he said.  We\u2019re not sure where the \u00a3170m figure\ncomes from. However, we know that since the end of\nSeptember, the government has given councils \u00a3110m to fund the Test and Trace\nSupport Payment scheme. This scheme gives those on low-incomes a\n\u00a3500 payment, if they can prove they will be financially affected if they have\nto stay at home for the 10-day isolation period. We recently used a Freedom of Information request for figures on this for all councils in England and Wales.  Their\nresponses showed that two-thirds of people who applied for the payment did not\nget it. Councils and unions told us that the\ncriteria for getting the payment was too tough. You can find out more about this here. The first day back at school for millions of children in England has \"gone well\", say head teachers. They are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms. Primary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests. As we reported earlier, at a Downing Street news conference the prime minister described it as a \"big day and an emotional day\" for families. Indoor care home visits have resumed in England today and the BBC has been speaking to some of those affected. Beccy Pile, 48, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent an hour with her 23 year-old son today at his care home in Essex earlier. Luke has lived at the home for adults with learning\ndisabilities for the last three years - but Beccy has only managed to see him twice in the last year before today.   \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been forever since I last saw him,\" she says. \"It\nwas incredible. He was really excited and had tidied his flat. \u201cWe had to stop ourselves from hugging each other because\nthat\u2019s not allowed yet but he has a sign for a hug where he puts his arms\nacross his chest which he did and he blew me lots of kisses. \u201cThe visit was incredibly well-managed. I only had an hour\nbut it didn\u2019t feel like an hour because the home had everything ready.  \"I had my\ntest in the car park half an hour before and as soon as it was negative I could\ngo in and spend my time with him. \u201cI did have a moment where I thought \u2018what if it\u2019s positive\nbecause Luke thinks I\u2019m coming?\u2019 I thought I might have to just see him through\nthe window or something but thankfully it was OK.\" Boris Johnson has finished his Downing Street briefing. If you're just a joining us, here's a recap of what was said: Asked by the Metro about a proposed 1% pay rise for some NHS workers, the PM repeats his \"gratitude\" for the nursing profession during the pandemic. He says that rather than a greater pay rise - which is what the unions have called for - many nurses have told him they most want to solve staffing issues in the health service and boost the number of people training to be nurses. \"I understand of course that the whole sector has been under massive pressure,\" he says, adding that the government has been investing \"colossally\" to support the NHS during Covid. The next journalist points to reports about parents failing to give permission for testing their children, and asks if they are \"undermining the safety of their classmates\".  Dr Harries says she does recognise that for many parents \"it is quite an unusual ask\" and \"it will take time for families to get used to that\". But she believes that, \"with time\", families will give their permission, as it will not just help students, but will be \"for their family's benefit as well\". The final question is away from Covid and about the ongoing post-Brexit issues with trade, especially in Northern Ireland.  Asked if it was time he \"came clean\" that his Brexit deal was not as great as he claimed, Johnson sticks to his guns by backing it.  He says there is \"no question\" that there have been \"teething problems\" - but he believes they can \"all be ironed out... with goodwill and imagination\".  Next up is a question for Dr Jenny Harries, after unions said schools could close again in the near future.  Asked if she agrees, she says \"hopefully not\" as education is \"critical\" - adding the public can be \"very optimistic\". But she warns there may be a short period with more students testing positive and being taken out of school, advising people to look to \"three or four weeks' time\" for an accurate reading of how it is going.  The PM is then pressed again about Harry and Meghan, and asked if the Royal family is racist. Johnson jokingly praises the reporter for his \"determined attempt to involve me in this story\". \"But he adds: \"I really think when it comes to matters with the Royal family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing.\" Ben Kentish of LBC asks whether lockdown could be eased a little earlier than the PM has set out in his roadmap, on the basis that the vaccine rollout is going so well. The PM says he agrees there are some \"encouraging signs\" in the data on vaccinations and declining case numbers, but that we must not forget there is a \"big budget of risk\" in reopening schools. He says \"the whole point\" of his cautious easing is to remember where we were last summer - when rates were relatively low - before a surge in cases in the autumn and winter. Johnson adds that he believes businesses would rather see a \"cautious and irreversible\" approach to easing measures than a \"hasty\" one that leads to them having to be closed down again. Harries adds that each stage of the roadmap involves waiting and checking, and \"we need that time period\" of four to five weeks of observation before moving on to the next phase. Jonathan Blake BBC political correspondent On International Women's Day, the prime minister says the burden of childcare and home-schooling has fallen\n\"disproportionately\" on women during the pandemic. Earlier, his spokeswoman told\nreporters he was keen to hear from women in business how flexible working could\ncontinue beyond the pandemic. Boris Johnson hosted a\nvirtual round table discussion with senior female business figures this\nmorning. But she said it was \"not\nunreasonable\" to ask questions about the PM's attitude to\nwomen given some of his past comments and work as a journalist. The BBC's Ben Wright asks if Johnson and Harries accept that infection rates will go up now that children in England are back in the classroom - and what would be an acceptable level. The PM says a risk of increased transmission now that schools are back is \"inevitable\". But he adds that immunity has \"bedded in\" for millions of people who have now had their first dose of the Covid vaccine, which means it's safe to continue with the reopening plans. As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be \"very, very cautious,\" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance \"just as much as Covid is\" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. \"I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,\" he says. He says he's spent \"a long time\" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of \u00a3200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details.  He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands \"the urgency that people feel\", but says the government must be \"driven by the data\".  He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital.  Johnson says we must \"remain prudent\" and people would prefer \"security and certainty\" in the roadmap out of lockdown.  Jonathan Blake BBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing\nthe public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to\nschools in England. He says the risk of increased\ntransmission is \u201cinevitable\u201d, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be \"bedded in.\" The key factor will be the\nimpact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the\nstrain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be \"considerably\nless\". It's perhaps the first sign\nof how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the\npandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public. The first - Arjun from Watford - asks about young people, saying they are at \"the bottom of the priority list\" and need more support. Johnson says \"the most important thing\" was getting young people back into school, which will make a \"massive difference\". For those thinking about jobs and their futures, he adds the government wants to \"give you the maximum possible help\" by supporting business.  The second member of the public asks the PM about the much-rumoured vaccine passports and how under-16s might be able to travel.  He says the government is looking at the way certificates could work, but adds they \"raise all sorts of issues\" around those who can't get vaccines, for example.  Johnson says it is a \"novel\" idea for the UK, but says they may become part of our future.  Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the declining death and case rates in the UK are \"pleasing\" but should have \"some caution attached\". The case rate is still falling, she says, but is not uniform across the country. Harries says \"it's really important\" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place. She adds that the case rate is back to around the levels the UK had in September, adding: \"This is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from.\" Boris Johnson says there now needs to be a \"concerted programme\" from the government to ensure it carries on with its \"cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom\". He says a quarter of the population has now been vaccinated and it has been at least three weeks since the most vulnerable had their first dose, giving him \"confidence\" in the first steps. As well as schools, changes today include being able to meet one to one outside, and for people to visit loved ones in care homes. Johnson warns, however, that this will have \"an impact on the spread of the virus\" - but promises that \"at all times, we will be driven by the data\" on opening up.  Unlocking too quickly would lead to a substantial surge in infection, the UK's chief medical adviser says. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to announce a limited easing of some lockdown restrictions at Holyrood. The temporary hospitals, which were largely unused, are being shut as patient numbers fall.

With only have six legislative days left, robust discussion on critical issues is as prominent as ever.\u00a0 While crafting the state budget remains at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds, we are staying the course to uphold our other legislative obligations as members of the General Assembly by passing bills that include specific reforms and amendments to keep the Commonwealth moving forward.\u00a0 Activity from the Senate Chamber this week includes passage of another Senate priority bill, Senate Bill (SB) 5. Among numerous other measures, it is a bill that works to mitigate the negative impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on Kentucky\u2019s economy and infrastructure. In this case, notably to support and provide reassurance to various sectors of our society trying to reopen or continue operation. If made law, SB 5 would provide liability protections for premises owners or leaseholders, including places of worship, schools, restaurants, medical facilities, and more. It would also establish essential services protections for food suppliers, manufacturers, distributors of personal protective equipment, child care service providers, and other businesses deemed essential. The measure, however, would not protect entities that act in a malicious or grossly negligent way to ignore safety orders during a state of emergency. As a sponsor of SB 5, I was pleased to see its passage this week.\u00a0 Senate Bill 122 is another bill I am sponsoring that passed this week. This measure would prohibit a state contract from being awarded to a business if it was already awarded the same or similar contract and if a contract was awarded through an executive agency lobbyist who was convicted of a crime related to contracts. It also prohibits a person associated with an agency from participating in a contract procurement for one year after termination.\u00a0 Other bills passing the Senate include: Senate Bill 53 allows a part-time adjunct instructor for the Kentucky Fire Commission to begin drawing benefits from the County Employees Retirement System without having to resign from that position, so long as the instructor has not previously participated in the Kentucky Employees Retirement System. Senate Bill 79 builds on the success of a bill that passed a couple of years ago that began automatically enrolling new state employees into Kentucky Deferred Compensation, but providing an opt-out option. SB 79 would do the same for legislators and judges. Deferred compensation serves as a savings account in which a certain portion of an employee\u2019s income is set aside to be paid later. Since the passage of the legislation related to state employees, 90 percent of new hires have remained in deferred comp, which stands to benefit them in the long run. Senate Bill 99 authorizes the construction of certain facilities without the supervision of a licensed architect or professional engineer, provided the work is performed consistent with the United States Department of Defense Building Code. Senate Bill 105 establishes guidelines for filing and serving a petition for the appointment of a person responsible for the possession, repair, and preservation of an abandoned and unsafe property. The bill also outlines the procedure for hearing a petition, defines the powers and duties of a conservator, and puts in place standards for the termination of a conservatorship.\u00a0 Senate Bill 128 provides any student enrolled in a Kentucky public school in grades K-12 during the 2020-21 school year the opportunity to request to participate in a temporary program during the 2021-22 school year to retake or supplement the courses or grades the student has already taken. The ultimate decision of providing this opportunity will be left to local school districts, which must decide to accept all student\u2019s requests or none at all. Quite simply, our students have missed their teachers, friends, and vital emotional and social experiences they deserve. SB 128 will provide local school districts with the ability to do right by students and families determining it is in their best interest to take advantage of a supplemental year of education. It will ensure participating seniors\u2019 preparedness for whatever their next chapter in life is, and all students the peace of mind knowing the pandemic will not cause them to be left behind.\u00a0 Senate Bill 146 establishes a requirement of a national and state criminal background check, via fingerprint analysis by the state police and the FBI, for every prospective and current employee of the Labor Cabinet or its agencies.\u00a0 Senate Bill 159 reorganizes the Kentucky Department of Military affairs by abolishing defunct offices and realigning others within the \u201cOffice of the Adjutant General.\u201d It also attaches the Kentucky Community Crisis Response Board to the Division of Emergency Management and alters its membership. Senate Bill 165 requires the link to a legal advertisement or notice website that the local government electronically publishes to be no more than 30 characters in length and in easy-to-understand terms. Senate Bill 172 requires persons who damage underground utility facilities, such as pipelines and telecommunications lines during demolition or excavation, to cease activity and notify the operator of the underground facility. Senate Bill 181 is a companion bill to House Bill (HB) 4, a bill that made final passage this week. HB 4 is a constitutional amendment bill, so it does not require the governor\u2019s signature. Instead, it will go before you, the voters, on the next general election ballot. If supported by a majority of voters, HB 4 would provide the General Assembly with the ability to call itself back into session. SB 181 would establish the Senate President\u2019s and House Speaker\u2019s power to reconvene the General Assembly for up to twelve additional legislative days via joint proclamation. Additionally, it would allow for any bills filed by the deadline of the close of a Regular Session to survive until December 31 of that same year. Senate Bill 212, also known as the \u201cKara Beth Adair Wilson Act,\u201d requires the various Kentucky retirement systems to develop an electronic method to which future changes to beneficiary designations for all members and new member forms, including beneficiary designation forms, must be submitted.\u00a0 Senate Bill 228 would reform how a U.S. Senator of Kentucky is replaced should a vacancy occur. The bill would establish that the departing senator\u2019s state party would nominate three people from which the governor would select. That individual would serve out the remainder of the term. Additionally, it sets stipulations about how long a replacement can serve before voters get to elect someone to take over that seat and establishes provisions about how such elections should be held.\u00a0 Senate Bill 255 relates to an emerging industry of commercial mining of cryptocurrency, as it provides incentives for this new and advanced technology in the Commonwealth by allowing a minimum investment of $1 million dollars to qualify for incentives. Bills headed to the governor\u2019s desk for consideration include: House Bill 7 establishes a Recovery Ready Community council and program for cities and counties that want to demonstrate their addiction recovery commitment. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 83,000 people died in the twelve months ending in July 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened addiction. The state has worked hard over the years to combat the scourge of drug addiction. Although the challenge is difficult, we must continue efforts to address the abuse of opioids and other narcotics. HB 7 is one more step in saving lives. House Bill 8 allows quasi-governmental organizations, such as local health departments and mental health centers, to pay back unfunded liabilities owed to the Kentucky Retirement Systems for Employees using a liability based system instead of a percent of payroll. By changing to a liability based contribution method, HB 8 provides assurance for accurate payment assumptions, allowing these agencies to adequately plan each fiscal year therefore reducing the risk of having to cut back on staff and services. HB 8 also establishes an intent that the general assembly will pay the increased cost associated with this bill for the first year. House Bill 50\u00a0provides that health insurance plans offered in Kentucky comply with a federal law designed to ensure the equal treatment of mental health conditions and substance use disorders by strengthening Kentucky\u2019s implementation of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. That means health plans\u2019 co-payments, deductibles, and limits on visits to health care providers are not more restrictive or less generous for mental health benefits than for medical and surgical benefits. An average of six people die of drug overdoses and suicides every day in Kentucky. It is vital that our state does not limit access or coverage to mental health care. House Bill 208 addresses the issue of getting our students back into schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this bill, local school districts MUST offer, at least, a hybrid schedule where all students are able to attend in-person classes a minimum of two days a week by March 29, 2021. Districts would still be able to offer virtual or remote learning for students whose Parents/Guardians provide written requests due to COVID-19 concerns. As a society, we have figured out a way to safely open restaurants, shopping malls, and movie theaters. It is time we finally do the same for Kentucky\u2019s youth by prioritizing a pathway to normalcy for our schools. You can learn more about these bills and others by visiting www.legislature.ky.gov.

            "text": " News Ecuador\u2019s Segmental Bridge, the country\u2019s longest, was inaugurated today, marking the completion of the first project built by a Chinese company that is financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The nearly two-kilometer-long bridge crosses the Babahoyo River in Dur\u00e1n, Guayas province. It was planned by Ecuador\u2019s Ministry of Transport and Public Works of Ecuador and built by the Chinese company Gaungxi Road & Bridge Engineering Corporation. \"The Segmental Bridge is a key public work venture that will improve access between Guayaquil, La Puntilla, Dur\u00e1n and other cities in Ecuador,\" said IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno. \"The bridge symbolizes the increasingly close ties between China and Latin America and the Caribbean.\" \"Competing in a globalized world requires a modern and efficient infrastructure,\u201d he added, \u201cand Chinese companies have much experience to offer in this regard.\" The bridge is 1,975 meters long and 20.8 meters wide. Its four lanes are designed to accommodate 70,000 light and heavy vehicles daily. The bridge also has a bike lane, a sidewalk, and two accesses. The new bridge will reduce travel times and improve the transportation flow between the highly productive areas of the Ecuadorian coast and the country\u2019s major market centers and neighboring countries. Use of the new bridge could cut transport costs by 25 percent and increase speeds by 50 percent. The IDB provided financing for $101.4 million as part of a loan for $350 million for the First Road Maintenance and Infrastructure Program signed by the Ecuadorian Government in February 2010. The program is included in the CCLIP Line of Financing for $1 billion approved by the IDB's Board to Ecuador in October 2009. The IDB\u2019s portfolio of operations for Ecuador, including those approved and those under execution, total $1.9 billion. Of this, $1.6 billion is directed to the public sector, $289 million to the private sector (large companies and banks), $18 million for projects financed by the Multilateral Investment Fund, and\u00a0more than\u00a0$2 million for social entrepreneurship projects. By the end of 2011, approvals of additional credits for the public and private sectors are expected to add an additional $700 million. Projects include the strengthening of public education, the modernization of the civil registry, the construction of a new airport in Quito, improved rural land titling, increased power transmission capacity, and support for small fishing operations, among others. China became an IDB member country in 2009. China and the Bank have a number of cooperation agreements to promote bilateral investment and trade between that country and Latin America and the Caribbean, including a recent agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China and another with the Bank of China to facilitate the use of the renminbi currency to finance trade between the two regions. \u00a0\u00a0"

According to doxo's recently released 2021 U.S. Bill Pay Market Size & Category Breakout report, the average U.S. household spends $22,668 per year, or $1,889 per month on the 10 most common household bills, which suggests that the American Rescue Plan's $1,400 stimulus checks will not even cover a month's worth of household bills for most Americans.\n \nConsumers Spend $1,889 per Month on the 10 Most Essential Household Bills\n \nAccording to doxoINSIGHTS' 2021 U.S. Bill Pay Market Size & Category Breakout report:\n \nWhile the $1,400 amount is the largest pandemic-related stimulus check to date, doxo's data shows that the typical household will see less than one month of coverage (just 22 days on average) for their most essential household bills.\n \n90% of Consumers Feel the Stimulus Check Will Improve Their Financial Health\n \nEven though the relief is short-term, doxo's latest survey of household bill payers indicates very strong support from consumers. An encouraging nine in ten people believe the stimulus checks will make a positive impact on them personally. Although the $1,400 will help, household finances are still severely stressed, with 41% of consumers expecting it to take more than a year for their financial health to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n \n\"While it can be disheartening to see the math around how far the stimulus check will stretch when it comes to household bills, every little bit helps Americans during these tough times,\" said Jim Kreyenhagen, VP of Marketing and Consumer Services at doxo. \"While it may be short-term relief, our survey data shows that the vast majority of Americans believe the stimulus checks will help improve their own financial health in 2021.\"\n \nHousing Costs, Utilities, Cable/Internet, and Mobile Top Consumers' Bill Pay Priorities\n \nAdditionally, doxo's survey found that the majority of Americans (59%) plan to use their stimulus checks to pay household bills, with either mortgage (32%) or rent (33%); utilities (78%); cable/internet (35%); and mobile phone (32%) topping the list.\n \nBreaking out the average amount spent per year on household bills, this is how far the $1,400 stimulus check will go toward each of the 10 most common bill pay categories:\n \nBill Pay Category\n \nAverage Amount Paid\u00a0(News - Alert)/Month*\n \nAmount $1,400 Stimulus Check Will Cover\n \nMortgage\n \n$1,279/month\n \n~1 month\n \nRent\n \n$1,062/month\n \n~1 month\n \nAuto Loan\n \n$412/month\n \n~3 months\n \nUtilities\n \n$316/month\n \n~4 months\n \nAuto Insurance\n \n$186/month\n \n~7 months\n \nCable & Internet\n \n$116/month\n \n~12 months\n \nHealth Insurance\n \n$113/month\n \n~12 months\n \nMobile Phone\u00a0(News - Alert)\n \n$103/month\n \n~13 months\n \nLife Insurance\n \n$89/month\n \n~15 months\n \nAlarm & Security\n \n$87/month\n \n~16 months\n \n*The sum of each bill pay category totals more than the average monthly household payment of $1,889 because the $1,889 per household total takes into account the percentage of households that have each bill category.\n \nThis doxoINSIGHTS data and other reports on the bill pay market can be found at www.doxo.com/insights.\n \nAbout doxoINSIGHTS\n \ndoxoINSIGHTS provides direct insight into household financial health and spending activity by leveraging consumer surveys and doxo's unique aggregate bill pay data set, comprising actual bill payment activity to confirmed household service providers across the country. doxo data brings together the broadest available data set for analyzing actual household bill payment activity, pulling from over four million paying consumers across over 90% of U.S. zip codes. doxo's payment network covers over 75,000 billers in 45 different service categories and enables payments using bank accounts, credit cards or debit cards.

The police charged Ayoola Olalekan and Balogun Emmanuel, whose house addresses were not given, with conspiracy, assault and malicious damage. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Sunday Osanyintuyi, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on March 1, 2021 at Oduduwa College, Ile-Ife. Osanyintuyi alleged that the defendants with others at large, conspired to commit felony to wit: serious assault and malicious damage. He told the court that the defendants allegedly damaged the Louvre Windows of Oduduwa College building with pebbles. He alleged that the defendants beat up Cpl. Aderibigbe Emmanuel, a security gurad while performing his lawful duty. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 356, 451 and 526(A) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Defence Counsel, Mr Sunday Olagbaju, pleaded with the court to grant his clients bail in the most liberal conditions, saying they would not jump bail since they had reason persons to stand\u00a0 as sureties Magistrate A.A.

            "text": " Located in the mountainous Piura region of Northern Peru along the border with Ecuador, the Rio Blanco mine is a 6,473 hectare (about 16,000 acres) copper and molybdenum concession.\u00a0 With an estimated 1.257 billion tons of copper, this planned open pit mine will be amongst the 20 largest copper mines in the world, if developed. It is predicted to produce about USD 1 billion worth of copper per year for at least twenty years. Zijin-owned Monterrico Metals began exploration of the mine following purchase in April 2007, and production is expected to begin in 2011. Residents of the local community protested the development of the mine and Zijin's investment in it on the grounds that it is an illegal concession without the consent of local communities as required by Peruvian law, and that pollution from the mine is infiltrating the regions waterways (on which local people depend for organic farming) and destroying the fragile cloud forest ecosystem. The concession was first established in 2002 by the British company Monterrico Metals, and 90 percent of the company was later acquired by a consortium of Chinese companies headed by Zijin Mining Group Ltd. Together these companies have formed Rio Blanco Copper SA. Zijin and the government of Peru must: Threat to local\nlivelihoods According to information from Oxfam America, the mine concession is in a forest region in the Huancabamba Mountains, which\ncomprise a fragile biological corridor for endangered species such as tapirs\nand bears, and feeds major rivers running to the coast and into the Amazon\nRiver.\u00a0 Communities in this area rely\nmainly on farming for their livelihoods, and have successfully obtained organic certification so their avocado, banana, coffee and mango crops can be sold at a premium on the international markets.\u00a0 Many farmers also raise cattle and grow corn and other food\ncrops to feed their families and sell on the local market.\u00a0 Pollution from the Rio Blanco Mine into the regions waterways puts at risk the organic certification that is the bread-and-butter for local farmers. Local communities want to increase farming in the region, and have been working with Peru's Ministry\nof Agriculture to make more land available to them and boost production. As a result of their\nefforts they increased production of organic bananas by more than 40 percent in\n2005.\u00a0 However, if the Rio Blanco mine goes forward it could open up\nadditional areas of Piura\nto mining, and significantly change the entire region from one primarily\noriented to farming, to an industrialized mining region. Failure to obtain\ncommunity authorization.\u00a0  Under Peruvian law*, mining companies must obtain the two-thirds approval of local community\nassemblies before entering community land to do exploration or other\nactivities. The\nowners of the mining concession failed to obtain this legal authorization when\nit entered the Rio Blanco project area in 2003.\u00a0\nFurther, a legal referendum held in September 2007 clearly displayed\ncommunity members' strong opposition to the project. Thus its presence in the\narea does not comport with existing legal requirements, a point that has been\nsustained by Peru's\nnational Public Defender's office.\u00a0 The illegality of the company's presence in the project area\nis contributing to suspicion and resentment toward the company amongst the\nlocal population. The company has not taken action to address this issue\ndespite repeated efforts by local stakeholders to raise this concern with\ncompany and government officials. *Peruvian Laws: Article 89, paragraph 2 of the Peruvian\nConstitution;\nLaw 24656 on Native and Peasant Communities; Law 26505 on Private Investment in\nEconomic Development.  Torture and killing\nof local people: The Rio Blanco project has been the site of a number of\nviolent incidents, including the killing of four community leaders and three company\npersonnel, since 2004. In August 2005, 28 people were allegedly detained\nand tortured by the mine's security forces after protests at the project site. One person\nwas killed in the incident.\u00a0 According to\nPeru's\nNational Human Rights Coordinator and Peruvian human rights organization FEDEPAZ,\nmembers of the company's security force, private security contractors, and the\nPeruvian National Police (PNP) were involved in the torture. Evidence of the torture was made public in early 2009 when\nphotographs taken of the incident were released by a journalist who had also\nbeen tortured. These incidents could amount to a violation of the victims'\nrights to personal security and to not be subjected to torture as established\nin the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture, both of which Peru has ratified. Violations of\nthese rights by contractors or police working directly for or at the behest of\nthe company could implicate the company in the violations. In 2009, the UK\nHigh Court froze GBP 5 million in assets of Monterrico Metals, a subsidiary of Zijin, in\nresponse to torture allegations brought against the company by victims of the\n2005 incidents.\u00a0 In July 2011, Monterrico settled with the victims out of court without admitting liability for an undisclosed amount. Although Zijin was not involved in the Rio Blanco project\nwhen violent conflicts initially broke out in 2004, the company has not taken\nthe appropriate steps to rectify complaints made by the communities and\nviolence has continued. In November 2009, three company workers were killed in\nan attack on the project site by unidentified assailants. In December, two more people were killed and eight injured\nin a conflict with local police as police tried to arrest a suspect in the\nNovember attack. In September 2008, members of a local civil association that\nhad made false accusations of terrorism against 35 people, including local authorities, community leaders\nand environmental and human rights activists, stated to government prosecutors\nthat they had received financing by Rio Blanco Copper for their activities. \u00a0 In February 2008, the Peruvian government fined\nZijin US$100,000 for noncompliance with the\nEnvironmental Evaluation Study approved by the government for the initial phase\nof exploration.\u00a0 Among the issues cited\nby the government in assessing the fine were: China's\nState Council's Nine Principles on Encouraging and Standardizing Foreign\nInvestment (October 2007); China's\nMinistry of Environmental Protection's Green Credit Policy; China's\nState-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission's Guidelines on\nFulfilling Social Responsibility by Central Enterprises (January 2008); China's\nExport-Import Bank's Environmental Assessment Policy  In July 2011, the case brought by Peruvian torture victims against Monterrico Metals in the UK High Court was settled when the company agreed to pay the claimants an undisclosed amount. In March 2011, Friends of the Earth-US, in collaboration with Peru's CooperAccion and Fedepaz and Belgian solidarity organization CATAPA, petitioned the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to ensure that Zijin Mining Group (listed as 2899:HK) fully discloses material risks associated with the Rio Blanco Mine.\u00a0 The letter raised concern about specific conflicts between the Zijin-led consortium and local Peruvian communities, and environmental violations Zijin was faulted for by the Peruvian government during the mine's exploration stage.\u00a0 It also noted that Zijin had not disclosed any of these problems to its shareholders and the public.\u00a0 The groups called on the HKSE to use its state-of-the-art disclosure standards to ensure that Zijin adequately report non-financial risks. In September 2010 several Peruvian organizations from northern Peru, along with international solidarity group Catapa, launched a campaign against the Rio Blanco mine project.\u00a0 The 'Mining in Paradise? No-go zones for mining' campaign, which was launched on the third anniversary of a community referendum that overwhelmingly opposed new mining concessions in the area, demands that mining companies and the government of Peru respect the communities' decision to keep mining off their land. Despite the unresolved social conflicts and environmental violations, Chinese media announced in July 2010 that Zijin will seek to increase its investment in the Rio Blanco Mine. The company faced harsh criticism from the media, civil society and financial analysts, in China because it has neglected internal management, risk management and the environment as it aggressively seeks to expand globally. Banks According to the 18 June 2011 edition of China Daily, Zijin International Finance Company Ltd, a unit of Zijin Mining Group, has hired Bank of China International Ltd. (Paris Branch) and BNP Paribas SA to help with the sale of US dollor bonds to raise capital for acquiring copper concentrates overseas for the 200,000 ton copper smelter project of Zijin Copper Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and for other overseas activities of the Group. According to the 2 September 2008 edition of Central Asia & Caucasus\nBusiness Weekly, China Exim Bank, the government of Tajikistan and Zijin International\nMining Co. Ltd. signed a Memorandum of Cooperation in August 2008. In May\n2008, Agricultural Bank of China\nand Zijin Mining signed an Agreement of Strategic Cooperation to provide Zijin\nMining a line of credit of CNY 10 billion.\u00a0 In January\n2008, Bank of China and Zijin Mining signed a CNY 10 billion worth of\nAgreement of Strategic Cooperation that was reportedly to facilitate the mining\ncompany's forays into overseas markets as well as domestic developments.\u00a0 According to China Metallurgy Daily, in December 2007 China Construction\nBank signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Zijin Mining that made CCB a\nlong-term partner and would allow Zijin priority treatment in securing\nfinancial services from the bank.\u00a0 Zijin also agreed to give CCB priority\ntreatment as its financier. In November\n2007, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China signed an Agreement of\nStrategic Cooperation with Zijin Mining that would provide Zijin with various\nfinancial services from the bank, including financing.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the 11 March edition of China Metallurgy\nWeekly, in March 2008 Sinosure entered into a global project financing\nagreement with Zijin in which its branch office in Fujian would support the mining company's\noverseas investments, mergers & acquisitions and global sales.\u00a0 Shareholders Some of Zijin's major shareholders include Minxi Xinghang\nState Owned Assets Investment Co., Ltd. and to a lesser extent other Chinese\nbusinesses that are registered with and partially owned by provincial and local\nbranches of the Chinese government.\u00a0 Major\npublic shareholders include Gold Fields of South Africa (5.7%) and Merrill Lynch (According to Zijin's 2006 Annual Report, Merrill Lynch holds 20.97% of H shares and 6.39% of total registered capital).  The Rio Blanco concession was first explored by UK-based\nMonterrico Metals in 2002.\u00a0 According to Oxfam\nAmerica, at that time the company failed to get permission to mine from local\ncommunities, which is required by Peruvian law, before beginning\nexploration.\u00a0 Citizens upset by the\nmine's illegal exploration activities held demonstrations throughout 2004 and\n2005, during which two people were killed and many were arrested.\u00a0 In one of the worst incidents, more than 25 citizens\nwere held against their will for multiple days and tortured by mine security guards after a protest; one person died during the\nordeal.\u00a0 In 2009, charges were brought against Monterrico Metals in the United\n  Kingdom by victims of the 2005 kidnapping and torture, for which \u00a35 million of the company's assets were frozen by the UK courts.\u00a0 In 2006, Peru's\nOmbudsman confirmed the position of the communities that the company failed\nto get citizen approval.\u00a0 In 2007, a consortium of Chinese miners led by Zijin Mining\nGroup bought a controlling stake in Monterrico\nMetals, whose primary asset was the Rio Blanco Mine.\u00a0 That same year, the local governments of\nseveral districts held non-binding referenda to allow citizens to voice their\nopinions on allowing mining in their communities.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, voter turnout was strong and\nthe majority voted against the proposed mine. Conflict has continued between the communities and Rio\nBlanco's new management.\u00a0 Several violent\nconflicts erupted at the end of 2009, leading to more casualties on both\nsides.\u00a0 The company has also violated\nPeruvian environmental laws - including drilling beyond the approved limits\nand improperly disposing of toxic waste - which has fostered distrust among the\ncommunities and has drawn fines from the Peruvian government. Despite the unresolved social conflicts and environmental violations,\nChinese media announced in July 2010 that Zijin will seek to increase its investment in the Rio Blanco Mine.\u00a0 Subsequently,\nthere were reports that the Zijin Consortium was making preparations for the\nexploitation phase of the project, in an effort to meet its goal of commencing production in 2011. On the company:\u00a0 In July 2010, toxic waste spills at Zijinshan,\nZijin's flagship gold mine in southeast China's Fujian Province contaminated a\nnearby river and poisoned 2,000 tons of fish (enough to feed 72,000 people for\na year).\u00a0 The July 3 accident was the worst mining spill in China\nin over two years.\u00a0 The company failed to\nreport the incident for nine days and attempted to bribe journalists to overlook the story.\u00a0 Once the spill\nwas reported, the China\nBanking Regulatory Commission announced that it was investigating Zijin for violating rules for listed\ncompanies on public disclosure of major incidences.\u00a0 Top executives of the company, including\nVice-President CHEN\nJiahong were detained in connection with the mishandling of the Zijinshan\ndisaster.\u00a0 Following the July 3 and July 16 spills, the Fujian government reportedly fined Zijin 30 million yuan (US$4.5 million) for environmental damages.\u00a0 This included a 9.6 million yuan (US$1.4 million) fine from Fujian environmental protection authorities in October 2010 and a subsequent fine from the Fujian courts in February 2011.\u00a0 In December 2010, Zijin's Chairman Chen Jinghe was fined 705,997 yuan (US$106,566) and Vice President Zou Laichang was fined 449,768 yuan by \nthe Fujian Provincial government for the toxic waste leaks, according to\n China's Caijing news citing the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\u00a0 Five company executives were also criminally charged for the spill and sentenced to a maximum of 3.5 years in prison (some with a suspended sentence), plus fines.\u00a0 Zijin appealed the ruling, but the verdict was upheld by a higher Fujian court in May 2011.\u00a0 The fines were well below earlier estimates, which media reports had stated could amount to as much as 500 million yuan, or US$74 million.\u00a0 Zijin also may have suffered financial losses of 254 million yuan (US$37 million) in revenues\nbecause of an order from the Shanghang local government to reduce gold\nproduction at the Zijinshan mine and 300\nmillion yuan (US$45 million) that the company said it would invest in environmental\nclean-up and environmental management systems at Zijinshan; although it is unclear if there has been independent monitoring to ensure the company held to its promises.\u00a0 In March 2011, Zijin made a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange that the Chinese government had increased its tax rate by 10% as a result of the Zijinshan spill.\u00a0 The company's tax rate went up to 25% starting in July 2010.\u00a0 Five local Shanghang County government officials, including environmental protection and pollution monitoring officers, were charged with crimes related to the spill in June 2011.\u00a0 They faced various charges including neglect of duty, corruption and bribery. That same year, a dam collapse at a Zijin mine site in Guangdong during September 2010 killed 22 people and deccimated homes in surrounding villages.\u00a0 An investigation by the Guangdong Provincial government found that Zijin \"holds direct liability for the accident [at the\nYinyan tin mine]\" particularly citing faulty dam construction that was\nunable to withstand extreme weather.\u00a0 Subsequently, Zijin agreed to sell the Yinyan mine to cover the costs of the accident, and said it would donate 50 million yuan (US$7.5 million) to the nearby Xinyi city government to assist victims\nof the dam collapse.\u00a0 Additionally, local victims of the dam collapse\nhave sought to hold Zijin accountable for the deaths and damage it\nbrought about.\u00a0 According\u00a0 to media reports citing Xinhua News in mid-February 2011, the\nlocal court in Xinyi city reported that over 800 lawsuits had been filed by residents against the company's Xinyi subsidiary and claims against the company could\neventually amount to 300 million yuan.\u00a0 Zijin was fighting the lawsuits. \u00a0 In October 2010 Zijin temporarily suspended\ntrading of its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange pending an announcement of\npenalties the company was to incur in connection with the July 2010 spill. The company faced harsh criticism from the media,\ncivil society and financial analysts,\nin China because it has neglected internal management, risk management and the\nenvironment as it aggressively seeks to expand globally."

Florida is getting busy.\u00a0Disney theme parks in Orlando are booked solid next Monday through Thursday. Throngs of college students are strolling the strip in Fort Lauderdale, many without masks and ignoring social distancing.\u00a0At least one\u00a0hot spot there, however, is pumping the brakes.\u00a0 The outdoor event space The Wharf, featuring live music, food and drink, announced on social media that during the spring break season guests with out-of-state ID must be 23 or older. The Wharf says it will be operating at reduced capacity and requiring\u00a0masks be worn at all times while walking through common areas and when not eating or drinking. In Miami Beach, Mayor Dan Gelber is determined to avoid a new burst of virus cases in his city. Gelber issued a stern warning\u00a0for spring break revelers: \"Don\u2019t be foolish. Don\u2019t come here if you think this is an anything-goes environment. We will arrest you and it will ruin your time here.\" Help is on the way:\u00a0The U.S. vaccination rate has risen to\u00a0an average of 2.2 million doses per day, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff\u00a0Zients announced. New York City alone administered 100,000 doses over the weekend. Also in the news:\u00a0 \u25baThe seven-day rolling average for daily new cases and COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. has decreased over the past two weeks. Infections dwindled from 66,162\u00a0on Feb. 21 to 57,972\u00a0on Sunday, while fatalities dropped from 1,873 on Feb. 21 to 1,677 on Sunday. \u25baMillions of Americans should start to see\u00a0stimulus checks\u00a0of up to $1,400 land in their bank accounts in just a few weeks.\u00a0The one-time payments are part of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion\u00a0COVID-relief package\u00a0that\u2019s expected to get final approval in the House on Wednesday. \u25baItaly surpassed 100,000 dead in the pandemic, a year after it became the first country in Europe to go on lockdown. The per-capita\u00a0death toll in Italy is about the same as in the U.S. \u25baColorado health officials are advising anyone who participated in a raucous Boulder party-turned-riot to quarantine for at least 10 days and to get tested for COVID-19. The event turned so violent a car was flipped over and a police SWAT team\u00a0used tear gas to break up the crowd.\u00a0 \u25baNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says her country will now use only the Pfizer vaccine to inoculate its population.

Wyoming is joining Texas and Mississippi, becoming the fifth\u00a0state \u2013\u00a0all led by Republican governors \u2013\u00a0to\u00a0lift mask mandates recently against the advice of\u00a0public health experts. A sixth state, Alabama,\u00a0extended the mandate\u00a0but said it would end on April 9. Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, whose order goes into effect March 16, also said several businesses will be able to resume normal operations.\u00a0They include establishments that typically operate indoors, such as bars, theaters, gyms and restaurants. The discarding of masking requirements by some states drew a rebuke last week from President Joe Biden, who likened the decisions to \"Neanderthal thinking,'' and a warning against prematurely removing restrictions\u00a0from the CDC. Satisfaction with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has increased enough that a majority of both Democrats and Republicans approve of it, but 1 out of every 4 Americans still say they'll never get the vaccine if they can avoid it, according to a new Monmouth University poll.\u00a0 Of the 60% of respondents who said they're at least somewhat satisfied with the vaccine rollout, 69% are Democrats and 58% Republicans. Partisanship is more of a dividing line in the decision to skip the vaccine, with 36% of Republicans saying they want to avoid it, compared to only 6% of Democrats. The survey also reveals the public is generally more pessimistic about how long it will take to return to normalcy after the pandemic, with 21% saying by the summer \u2013\u00a0down from 29% in a January survey \u2013\u00a040% saying by the end of the year and 27% saying even later. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased guidelines for fully vaccinated Americans on Monday, saying they can visit with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing.\u00a0They can also visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 \u2013 indoors and without wearing masks or physical distancing. Fully vaccinated people\u00a0also don't need to\u00a0quarantine or get testing following a known exposure if asymptomatic.\u00a0But they still must take precautions in public such as wearing a well-fitted mask and physical distancing and avoidance of medium- and large-size\u00a0in-person gatherings. \"COVID-19 continues to exact a tremendous toll on our nation,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing of the White House COVID-19 Response Team. \"Science and the protection of public health must guide us as we begin to resume activities.\" Read more: Your questions answered on the new CDC guidelines. The Biden administration said Monday that it is taking steps to combat Russian disinformation aimed at undermining confidence in the vaccines produced by Pfizer Inc. and other Western companies. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki's remarks\u00a0came in the wake of a Sunday report in the Wall Street Journal that four publications, all serving as fronts for Russian intelligence, have targeted Western-produced COVID-19 vaccines with misleading coverage that exaggerates the risk of side effects and raises questions about their efficacy. \u201cWe will fight (the disinformation) with every tool we have,\u201d Psaki said during a press briefing on Monday. \u2013 Deirdre Shesgreen More than\u00a0100,000 New Yorker City residents were vaccinated over the weekend, raising the total doses administered in the city to more than 2.3 million, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. The mayor said the city could vaccinate 500,000 per week if it can get more supply. Many residents who \"had hesitation before\" about getting vaccinated told him they are now ready, de Blasio said. And the Johnson & Johnson shot is the vaccine of choice, he said. \"One of the most consistent things we heard is people want the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because it's one dose and you're done,\" the mayor said. President Joe Biden will make the first prime-time address of his term\u00a0Thursday night to commemorate\u00a0the one-year anniversary of shutdowns\u00a0taken across the nation at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who announced the address, did not provide\u00a0a time or say where the president will deliver remarks.\u00a0State lockdowns rapidly closed businesses across the country, spiking unemployment to a high of 14.8% last April before slowly improving. \"He will discuss the many sacrifices that the American people have made over the last year and the grave loss communities and families across the country have suffered,\" Psaki said. \"The president will look forward, highlighting the role that Americans will play in beating the virus and moving the country to getting back to normal.\" \u2013 Joey Garrison The number of Americans now completely vaccinated for COVID-19 has surpassed the number of reported cases of the virus since the pandemic began more than a year ago. Just over 31\u00a0million people have been completely vaccinated, 9.4% of the population, according to the CDC. The Johns Hopkins data dashboard counts 29 million cases of the virus reported nationwide, but experts warn that reported cases likely represent a fraction of actual infections. Recent studies indicate that adults with Down syndrome, specifically those 40 and older, are\u00a0three to 10 times as likely\u00a0to die from COVID-19 than the general population. The findings confirmed what many had already suspected \u2013 that those with\u00a0the genetic disorder,\u00a0already prone to respiratory issues, heart conditions and other risk factors for coronavirus, were more susceptible to the virus\u2019 harmful effects. But Down syndrome priority for the vaccine varies from state to state. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they should be moved to the front of the line,\u201d said Republican Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen of Minnesota, lead author of a letter signed by bipartisan state legislators last month imploring health officials to prioritize\u00a0adults with the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how dangerous it could be for these individuals if they don\u2019t get the vaccine.\u201d \u2013 Marc Ramirez The U.S.\u00a0added a record 380 new coronavirus variant cases Sunday, continuing a trend that has seen the country double its known total of such coronavirus infections since Feb. 18. Different\u00a0versions of the virus that causes COVID-19 are spreading quickly even as the pace of new infections has generally been falling nationwide. The variants can spread more easily, dodge some treatments and immunities or both, leaving them a threat even as more Americans get vaccinated. The U.S. has 3,133 known variant cases, up from the 2,753 reported Thursday,\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control said Sunday. Most of America's known variant cases are of B.1.1.7, which was first seen in the United Kingdom, with 3,037. Vaccines have proved\u00a0effective against it, but the variant is considered\u00a0at least 50% more infectious than the original strain, making fast, widespread vaccination imperative. \u2013 Mike Stucka"

The fire broke out at the center run by the Houthi rebels on Sunday. The cause is yet to be determined. \"We are deeply saddened by the death of the refugees and guards in the migrant detention facility in Sanaa as a result of a fire. Eight people died, however, the final tally is supposed to be much higher. Condolences to the families of the victims and all those injured,\" the IOM regional office wrote on Twitter late on Sunday. The organization added it was providing medical assistance to over 170 injured, 90 of whom are in critical condition. The Middle Eastern country has been engulfed in an armed conflict between the government forces, led by President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi, who is backed by a Saudi-led military coalition, and the Houthi movement for several years now. The Saudi-led coalition of Arab states entered the conflict on the side of the government in 2015, after the Houthis made significant gains during the early days of clashes. Since then, the coalition has been conducting air, land and sea operations against the rebels, who control the official capital of Sanaa and large areas in northern and western Yemen.

The bid, by the firm that built Couva Children\u2019s Hospital under the former regime, came in $600 million lower than its nearest rival, Deyalsingh added.

He said the St James Hospital will be upgraded at a cost of $53 million to be expanded from its current role of offering radiation and accident and emergency (A&E) services to offering 69 additional beds, plus a laboratory and an operating theatre. The China Railway Construction Caribbean Company will do the construction, he added.

It\u2019s a false premise.\u201d He added that Chinese firms had built structures under the former government, including the Couva Children\u2019s Hospital, and national cycling and swimming centres.

            "text": " Sign In Register CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 A Harvard University professor has ignited an international uproar and faces mounting scrutiny for alleging that Korean women who were kept as sex slaves in wartime Japan had actually chosen to work as prostitutes. In a recent academic paper, J. Mark Ramseyer rejected a wide body of research finding that Japan\u2019s so-called \u201ccomfort women\u201d were forced to work at military brothels during World War II. Ramseyer instead argued that the women willingly entered into contracts as sex workers. His paper has intensified a political dispute between Japan, whose leaders deny that the women were coerced, and South Korea, which has long pressed Japan to provide apologies and compensation to women who have shared accounts of rape and abuse. Decades of research has explored the abuses inflicted on comfort women from Korea and other nations previously occupied by Japan. In the 1990s, women began sharing accounts detailing how they were taken to comfort stations and forced to provide sexual services for the Japanese military. Hundreds of scholars have signed letters condemning Ramseyer's article, which united North and South Korea in sparking outrage. Last Tuesday, North Korea\u2019s state-run DPRK Today published an article calling Ramseyer a \u201crepulsive money grubber\u201d and a \u201cpseudo scholar.\u201d Ramseyer, a professor of Japanese legal studies at Harvard Law School, declined to comment. Ramseyer\u2019s article, titled \u201cContracting for sex in the Pacific War,\u201d was published online in December and was scheduled to appear in the March issue of the International Review of Law and Economics. The issue has been suspended, however, and the journal issued an \u201cexpression of concern\u201d saying the piece is under investigation. Most alarming to historians is what they say is a lack of evidence in the paper: Scholars at Harvard and other institutions have combed though Ramseyer's sources and say there is no historical evidence of the contracts he describes. In a statement calling for the article to be retracted, Harvard historians Andrew Gordon and Carter Eckert said Ramseyer \u201chas not consulted a single actual contract\u201d dealing with comfort women. \u201cWe do not see how Ramseyer can make credible claims, in extremely emphatic wording, about contracts he has not read,\u201d they wrote. Alexis Dudden, a historian of modern Japan and Korea at the University of Connecticut, called the article a \u201ctotal fabrication\u201d that disregards decades of research. Although some have invoked academic freedom to defend Ramseyer, Dudden counters that the article \u201cdoes not meet the requirements of academic integrity.\u201d \u201cThese are assertions out of thin air,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear from his writing and his sources that he has never seen a contract.\u201d More than 1,000 economists have signed a separate letter condemning the article, saying it misuses economic theory \u201cas a cover to legitimize horrific atrocities.\u201d A separate group of historians of Japan issued a 30-page article explaining why the article should be retracted \u201con grounds of academic misconduct.\u201d At Harvard, hundreds of students signed a petition demanding an apology from Ramseyer and a university response to the complaints against him. Harvard Law School declined to comment. A United Nations report from 1996 concluded that the comfort women were sex slaves taken through \u201cviolence and outright coercion.\u201d A statement from Japan in 1993 acknowledged that women were taken \u201cagainst their own will,\u201d although the nation\u2019s leaders later denied it. Tensions flared again in January when a South Korean court ruled that the Japanese government must give 100 million won ($90,000) to each of 12 women who sued in 2013 over their wartime sufferings. Japan insists all wartime compensation issues were settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing relations with South Korea. In South Korea, activists have denounced Ramseyer and called for his resignation from Harvard. Chung Young-ai, South Korea\u2019s minister of gender equality and family, expressed dismay over the article last week. \u201cThere is an attempt to distort (the facts about) the Japanese military\u2019s \u2018comfort women\u2019 issue and tarnish the honours and dignity of victims,\u201d Chung said, according to comments provided by her ministry. Lee Yong-soo, a 92-year-old South Korean and survivor, described Ramseyer\u2019s assertion as \u201cludicrous\u201d and demanded he apologize. An influential activist, Lee is campaigning for South Korea and Japan to settle their decadeslong impasse by seeking judgment from the International Court of Justice. When asked about Ramseyer last Wednesday, Lee said: \u201cThat professor should be dragged to (the ICJ) too.\u201d The controversy, amplified by its source at an Ivy League university, has yielded new scrutiny of Ramseyer's other work. In response to new concerns raised by scholars, The European Journal of Law and Economics added an editor's note saying it's investigating a recent piece by Ramseyer \u2014 this one studying Koreans living in early 20th century Japan. Cambridge University Press said a forthcoming book chapter by Ramseyer is \u201cbeing revised by the author after consultation between the author and the editors of the book.\u201d Ramseyer repeated his claims about comfort women in a submission to a Japanese news site in January. In it, he alleged the women entered into contracts similar to those used under a separate, licensed system of prostitution in Japan. He rejected accounts of forced labour as \u201cpure fiction,\u201d saying the Japanese army \u201cdid not dragoon Korean women to work in its brothels.\u201d \u201cExpressing sympathy to elderly women who have had a rough life is fine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPaying money to an ally in order to rebuild a stable relationship is fine. But the claims about enslaved Korean comfort women are historically untrue.\u201d Opponents counter that many of the women were so young they would have been unable to consent to sex even if there was evidence of contracts. \u201cWe're really talking about 15-year-olds,\u201d said Dudden, at the University of Connecticut. \u201cThis article further victimizes the very few number of survivors by asserting claims that even the author knows cannot be substantiated.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim and Kim Tong-hyung contributed from Seoul.

            "text": " A Chinese-Mexican partnership is set to invest some $200 million to build two wind farms, the first on a windswept stretch of the Gulf of Mexico.  Mexican energy developer Vive Energia and Chinese turbine manufacturer Envision Energy have joined forces to work on the green energy projects in Mexico's booming southeast Yucatan Peninsula, through their joint venture firm Renewable Energy of the Peninsula (Energia Renovable de la Peninsula).  The first wind farm is to be built, with an investment of $120 million, in Progreso, a Yucatan port on the Gulf of Mexico.  Its 36 120-meter-high wind turbines will churn out 90 megawatts (MW) of energy, with most of it (85 MW) to be sold to the state-run Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and the remainder to the private sector.  \"This project represents the largest investment ever by any Chinese company in Mexico's wind energy sector,\" said Rafael Valdez, Envision Energy's director for Latin America.  The project is one of 16 wind farms and solar plants that 11 firms from five different countries will be building in different parts of Mexico after winning the rights at a federal government auction held in late March, Mexico's daily Milenio reported at the time.  In this way, Mexico's CFE aims to boost electricity to the national grid through renewable energy sources.  \"We are very pleased, because out of the many investments we have seen in Latin America by the Asian country ... most have been in the extractive sector, in natural resources projects,\" Valdez said.  In contrast, this project represents \"capital, technology and infrastructure that comes to Mexico to stay\", Valdez said.  In addition, he said, the project will generate clean energy that will promote productivity on the peninsula, create jobs and boost revenue.  Construction is expected to get underway in the second half of 2016 and be completed sometime next year, before the March 2018 deadline set by the government for starting operations.  Valdez said the joint venture firm is in talks with multinational development banks and financial institutions in the two countries to drum up financing for the project, the only one in the auction that proposed a hybrid scheme to supply energy to both the CFE and the private sector.  Envision Energy, China's third-largest producer of wind turbines and among the top 10 in the world, plans to bring the 36 turbines, each measuring 110 meters in diameter and capable of generating 2.5 MW of energy, over from China, while the steel towers they are mounted on will be made in Mexico.  Along with the wind farm in Progreso, the joint venture is set to begin building a second wind farm in 2016 in Dzilam de Bravo, a coastal town located just more than 80 kilometers east of Progreso.  This $80 million wind farm will have 70 MW in installed capacity via 28 2.5 MW wind turbines and supply energy to various companies on the peninsula, which is home to the states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo and Campeche.  The head of Viva Energia, Jose Antonio Aguilar, said the decision to build the plants in the Yucatan Peninsula was based on the growing demand for electricity in the region's cities and tourist resorts, among them Cancun and the Riviera Maya, on the Caribbean coast.

Bolton 9\u00b0c Artist\u2019s impression of the distant quasar Astronomers have discovered and analysed the most distant source of radio emission known to date. The source is what scientists call a radio-loud quasar \u2013 a bright object with powerful jets emitting at radio wavelengths \u2013 that is so far away its light has taken 13 billion years to reach Earth. Researchers say the discovery could help them understand the early universe. Quasars are very bright objects at the centre of some galaxies, and are powered by supermassive black holes. As the black hole consumes the surrounding gas, energy is released, making them visible to astronomers even when they are very far away. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe black hole is eating up matter very rapidly, growing in mass at one of the highest rates ever observed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t According to the study published in The Astrophysical Journal, the newly discovered quasar, nicknamed P172+18, is so distant that light from it has travelled for about 13 billion years to reach Earth. It is seen as it was when the universe was just around 780 million years old. This is the first time researchers have been able to identify the tell-tale signatures of radio jets in a quasar this early on in the history of the universe. Only about 10% of quasars \u2013 which astronomers classify as radio-loud \u2013 have jets, which shine brightly at radio frequencies. P172+18 is powered by a black hole about 300 million times bigger than the Sun. Chiara Mazzucchelli, a fellow at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, led the discovery together with Eduardo Banados of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. She said: \u201cThe black hole is eating up matter very rapidly, growing in mass at one of the highest rates ever observed.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs soon as we got the data, we inspected it by eye, and we knew immediately that we had discovered the most distant radio-loud quasar known so far\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Astronomers think there is a link between the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and the powerful radio jets spotted in quasars such as P172+18. The jets are thought to be capable of disturbing the gas around the black hole, increasing the rate at which gas falls in. Studying radio-loud quasars can provide insights into how black holes in the early universe grew to their supermassive sizes so quickly after the Big Bang. P172+18 was first recognised as a far-away quasar at the Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Mr Banados said: \u201cAs soon as we got the data, we inspected it by eye, and we knew immediately that we had discovered the most distant radio-loud quasar known so far.\u201d Researchers believe this radio-loud quasar could be the first of many to be found, perhaps at even larger cosmological distances.

Sign Up (Jamaica Observer) MONTEGO BAY, St James \u2014Not even a heavy afternoon downpour could further delay the long-awaited ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of the US$43 million Western Children and Adolescents Hospital on the grounds of the Cornwall Regional Hospital, yesterday. The facility is a gift from the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and will have 220 beds. It will be the first of its kind in the English-speaking Caribbean, offering specialist medical care for youngsters up to age 18 years. Funding for the project is being provided under an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, which was signed on Thursday, October 18 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, New Kingston, by portfolio minister Kamina Johnson Smith, on behalf of the Jamaican Government; and China\u2019s Ambassador to Jamaica Tian Qi. Prime Minister Andrew Holness, who broke ground for the facility, said he was happy with design of the hospital, arguing that the way in which some buildings are constructed in Jamaica poses huge problems which impact health. Minister of Health and Wellness Dr Christopher Tufton, who welcomed the construction of the facility, said it will be the first hospital to be built in the country in two decades. \u201cIn terms of this regional health authority geographic space it is 500,000 people who will be served in this region, comprising St James, Westmoreland, Trelawny and Hanover,\u201c said Dr Tufton. He added: \u201cThe Western Children and Adolescents Hospital is a significant indication of the commitment of our honourable prime minister and the Administration to advance the improvement of public health infrastructure.\u201d \u00a0\u201cToday is a good day for the people of Jamaica and the relationship between Jamaica and the people of China,\u201d Dr Tufton said. Ambassador Qi, at the same time, noted that the construction of the facility, which is expected to be completed in two years, is a testament of the friendship between Kingston and Beijing. \u201cFor the past 47 years we have been working together as true friend and real partners,\u201d said the Chinese ambassador. Mayor of Montego Bay Councillor Homer Davis also commended the Chinese Government for its generous contribution of the well- needed paediatric and adolescents hospital in western Jamaica. Meanwhile, Holness, who argued that \u201ccredit must be given where credit is due\u201d, praised former Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller for initiating the partnership with the Chinese Government for the construction of the public health care facility. \u201cThe concept of having the paediatric adolescents hospital didn\u2019t start with her (Simpson Miller), obviously something that was always conceptualised, but she brought it a step closer when she visited China [in 2013] and placed it on the agenda as a project of cooperation between Jamaica and the people of China. The Government of China agreed and that brought the project one step closer to fruition. So I want to acknowledge her great effort and input in reaching to this point,\u201d Holness remarked under heavy rain beating down on the tent under which the ground-breaking ceremony was held. The heavy rains also forced the ground-breaking to be done under the tent. A FREE roundup of top news from Guyana you might otherwise miss. Delivered every morning."

            "text": "  Print \nBy  Liz Wells \nin  Industry News\n8th March 2021 Independent retailers in England are now able to sign up for the government\u2019s free Covid-19 workplace testing programme. Workplace testing is now available to all businesses, including those with fewer than 50 employees, and businesses are being encouraged to register their interest by 31 March. Lateral flow testing will remain free until the end of June, the government said. Rapid testing detects cases quickly \u2013 in under 30 minutes \u2013 meaning positive cases can isolate immediately, breaking chains of transmission. The government says more than 3,500 businesses have signed up to offer workplace testing programmes, and over 14,000 have registered their interest in offering rapid testing, with many already rolling tests out. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cRegular workplace testing is a vital part of our route back to normal life, which is why I\u2019m very pleased that we\u2019re now expanding our offer of free workplace testing to businesses of all sizes, including SMEs. \u201cThese rapid tests will allows positive cases of Covid-19 to be caught quickly, which is crucial in helping businesses protect their workplaces and employees as we cautiously lift restrictions.\u201d Federation of Small Business chairman, Mike Cherry, added: \u201cA workplace testing infrastructure that works for businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers, is fundamental to bringing the coronavirus under control and ensuring that this current lockdown is the last. It\u2019s great to see that the smallest businesses can now apply to set-up testing facilities on their premises. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that they are given all the support they need to do so successfully as they focus on staying afloat in extremely changing circumstances. We\u2019d encourage all small firms that would benefit from a testing facility to apply as swiftly as they can.\u201d An online portal has been launched for businesses to find out more about offering rapid workplace testing. Businesses will be provided with all the information they need to plan and deliver their testing programme, along with promotional materials.

            "text": " DARIEN, IL \u2014 Darien's city administrator last week defended the police chief in response to criticism by a City Council candidate who says local police brutalized him during a 2019 encounter.  In comments on Patch on Friday, City Administrator Bryon Vana said Ward 5 City Council candidate John Laratta \"crossed the line\" in his most recent comments about Police Chief Greg Thomas, calling the statements \"inaccurate and defamatory.\" Since filing his candidacy in December, Ward 5 candidate John Laratta, a disabled Vietnam veteran, has continually railed against the Darien Police Department in the comments section on Patch. He contends he was injured when police arrested him late one night in December 2019, with officers saying they believed he fired gunshots before they arrived. No charges were filed against Laratta, and he maintained he did not fire a gun.  But Laratta's wife contradicted his story, telling police in an interview that her husband fired the shots. In January, Thomas said the police had plenty of probable cause to arrest Laratta, but the state's attorney's office decided against prosecuting.  On Friday, Laratta told Darien residents to remember that Thomas was \"found lying and giving false information again and again and again to the City Council,\" but Laratta provided no examples.  \"The City Council disregarded all of this and despite repeated demands for his resignation the Darien City Council has not disciplined him\" or any other Darien officer, Laratta said. \"The answer of WHO IS RUNNING Darien is now answered. It's all good, says the police chief, then it must be so.\" In a reply, Vana said he typically responds on social media, not in the comments section of Patch. He said the chief's \"stellar career\" includes being the Aurora police chief.  \"His dedication to the police profession, earning awards, attending special training, and receiving recognitions from many groups, speaks to Chief Thomas's credibility and professionalism during his career,\" Vana said. \"As City Administrator, Chief Thomas reports to me. I say, with the utmost confidence, and Mayor (Joseph) Marchese concurs, that Chief Thomas is doing a tremendous job as your police chief.\" Vana said Thomas has not been found lying or giving false information to the City Council, as Laratta asserted. In response to Vana, Laratta said the \"line was crossed\" in the December 2019 incident. He said he would not be bullied by council members who turn a blind eye to \"disgraceful\" Darien police actions.  Laratta could not be reached for comment, particularly to give examples to back up his assertion that the chief repeatedly lies to the council.  Laratta is facing Ward 5 Alderwoman Mary Sullivan in the April 6 election. In a Patch questionnaire last month, Laratta said he had retired to Florida. Property tax records shows he owns a beach condo in the Sunshine state. Despite his questionnaire response, he said he still lives in Darien.

Partisanship is more of a dividing line in the decision to skip the vaccine, with 36% of Republicans saying they want to avoid it, compared to only 6% of Democrats. The survey also reveals the public is generally more pessimistic about how long it will take to return to normalcy after the pandemic, with 21% saying by the summer \u2013\u00a0down from 29% in a January survey \u2013\u00a040% saying by the end of the year and 27% saying even later. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased guidelines for fully vaccinated Americans on Monday, saying they can visit with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing.\u00a0They can also visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 \u2013 indoors and without wearing masks or physical distancing. Fully vaccinated people\u00a0also don't need to\u00a0quarantine or get testing following a known exposure if asymptomatic.\u00a0But they still must take precautions in public such as wearing a well-fitted mask and physical distancing and avoidance of medium- and large-size\u00a0in-person gatherings. \"COVID-19 continues to exact a tremendous toll on our nation,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing of the White House COVID-19 Response Team. \"Science and the protection of public health must guide us as we begin to resume activities.\" Read more: Your questions answered on the new CDC guidelines. The Biden administration said Monday that it is taking steps to combat Russian disinformation aimed at undermining confidence in the vaccines produced by Pfizer Inc. and other Western companies. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki's remarks\u00a0came in the wake of a Sunday report in the Wall Street Journal that four publications, all serving as fronts for Russian intelligence, have targeted Western-produced COVID-19 vaccines with misleading coverage that exaggerates the risk of side effects and raises questions about their efficacy. \u201cWe will fight (the disinformation) with every tool we have,\u201d Psaki said during a press briefing on Monday. \u2013 Deirdre Shesgreen More than\u00a0100,000 New Yorker City residents were vaccinated over the weekend, raising the total doses administered in the city to more than 2.3 million, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. The mayor said the city could vaccinate 500,000 per week if it can get more supply. Many residents who \"had hesitation before\" about getting vaccinated told him they are now ready, de Blasio said. And the Johnson & Johnson shot is the vaccine of choice, he said. \"One of the most consistent things we heard is people want the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because it's one dose and you're done,\" the mayor said. President Joe Biden will make the first prime-time address of his term\u00a0Thursday night to commemorate\u00a0the one-year anniversary of shutdowns\u00a0taken across the nation at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who announced the address, did not provide\u00a0a time or say where the president will deliver remarks.\u00a0State lockdowns rapidly closed businesses across the country, spiking unemployment to a high of 14.8% last April before slowly improving. \"He will discuss the many sacrifices that the American people have made over the last year and the grave loss communities and families across the country have suffered,\" Psaki said. \"The president will look forward, highlighting the role that Americans will play in beating the virus and moving the country to getting back to normal.\" \u2013 Joey Garrison The number of Americans now completely vaccinated for COVID-19 has surpassed the number of reported cases of the virus since the pandemic began more than a year ago. Just over 31\u00a0million people have been completely vaccinated, 9.4% of the population, according to the CDC. The Johns Hopkins data dashboard counts 29 million cases of the virus reported nationwide, but experts warn that reported cases likely represent a fraction of actual infections. Recent studies indicate that adults with Down syndrome, specifically those 40 and older, are\u00a0three to 10 times as likely\u00a0to die from COVID-19 than the general population. The findings confirmed what many had already suspected \u2013 that those with\u00a0the genetic disorder,\u00a0already prone to respiratory issues, heart conditions and other risk factors for coronavirus, were more susceptible to the virus\u2019 harmful effects. But Down syndrome priority for the vaccine varies from state to state. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they should be moved to the front of the line,\u201d said Republican Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen of Minnesota, lead author of a letter signed by bipartisan state legislators last month imploring health officials to prioritize\u00a0adults with the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how dangerous it could be for these individuals if they don\u2019t get the vaccine.\u201d \u2013 Marc Ramirez The U.S.\u00a0added a record 380 new coronavirus variant cases Sunday, continuing a trend that has seen the country double its known total of such coronavirus infections since Feb. 18. Different\u00a0versions of the virus that causes COVID-19 are spreading quickly even as the pace of new infections has generally been falling nationwide. The variants can spread more easily, dodge some treatments and immunities or both, leaving them a threat even as more Americans get vaccinated. The U.S. has 3,133 known variant cases, up from the 2,753 reported Thursday,\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control said Sunday. Most of America's known variant cases are of B.1.1.7, which was first seen in the United Kingdom, with 3,037. Vaccines have proved\u00a0effective against it, but the variant is considered\u00a0at least 50% more infectious than the original strain, making fast, widespread vaccination imperative. \u2013 Mike Stucka This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Spring break in Florida won't be 'anything goes' this year; Wyoming becomes fifth state to drop mask mandate: Live COVID-19 updates Like us on Facebook to see similar stories Please give an overall site rating:"

            "text": " Fitting with the U.N.'s theme for International Women's Day this year -- women in leadership -- Gallup looks at the never-before-released results on a series of questions that we asked on this topic in 2019 and early 2020. Gallup asked women and men in 74 countries questions in four areas that are key to starting conversations in an action-driven way: women's leadership in politics and in the workplace, their opportunities for education, and whether movements such as #MeToo help to reduce harassment and sexual abuse of women. Women have been present in various levels of political leadership for years in Africa, but former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's election as the first female head of state in 2006 opened the door for others who have occupied the top leadership posts since. Africa currently has just one female president and three female prime ministers, but majorities across most of the 21 countries surveyed in 2019 say it is possible that a woman could lead their country in the next 10 years. In Madagascar, Niger and Zimbabwe residents are evenly divided as to whether it is possible for a woman to become the leader of their country in the next 10 years. Mauritania is the only country surveyed where a majority (55%) says it is not possible for a woman to be their country's leader. Such attitudes in Mauritania may reflect the relatively low representation that women have in the country's national politics. However, the 2014 election featured the country's second-ever female candidate. With a few exceptions, most men and women believe it is possible for a woman to lead their country someday soon, but women in many countries are more confident than men in this possibility. A median of 65% of women across the 21 countries surveyed say it is possible for this to happen in the next 10 years, compared with a median of 57% of men. While the numbers of women in management positions in Africa have improved in some countries in recent years, women in many countries (where data are available) still largely remain underrepresented in middle and senior management. Based on residents' attitudes as to their preference for a manager -- a man or a woman -- this dynamic is unlikely to change anytime soon. Across the 21 countries surveyed, a median of 47% say that if they could choose to have a man or a woman as a manager, they would prefer a man. A median of 34% would prefer a woman. Men as managers are preferred in all except four countries. While residents in Lesotho, Chad and Togo are more divided, people in Mauritius are the only ones to prefer a woman to a man as a manager. Men in the region decidedly prefer a male manager to a female manager if given the choice: a median of 56% say that they prefer a man as their boss. Women, on the other hand, are more divided, with a median of 43% saying they would prefer a woman and 39% preferring a male manager. In six of the countries, including Benin, Madagascar, Niger, Chad, Lesotho and Mauritius, a majority of women say they would prefer a female boss. Although millions of young people have swelled the ranks of colleges and universities across sub-Saharan Africa over the past few decades, the percentage of the population enrolled in tertiary education still remains far lower than elsewhere around the world. And within that population, females continue to be underrepresented: For every 100 males enrolled in tertiary education in 2013, 72 females were enrolled. With gender parity in higher education slowly improving in sub-Saharan Africa, people may realize how female education disproportionately improves social welfare. Across the 21 countries surveyed, a median of 46% say if a similarly qualified woman and man were competing for a single scholarship to a university, the scholarship should go to the woman. A median of 38% say it should go to the man. Still, this attitude does not prevail everywhere. In four countries, Niger, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo and Comoros, people are more likely to say the scholarship should go to the man. In several others, including Mali, Mozambique, Mauritania, Gabon and Ivory Coast, populations are more divided as to who should get it. Men and women across the region do not agree on who the recipient of the scholarships should be. Women are far more likely to believe this shot at higher education should go to the female, with a median of 52% saying a woman should get the scholarship versus 27% who say it should go to the man. Men are more likely to say that the man should get the scholarship, but they are more divided than women are: A median of 47% say the scholarship should go to the man, and 36% say it should go to the woman. The #MeToo movement that started in the U.S. may not have been as widespread in sub-Saharan Africa as it was in other parts of the world, but it has had an impact in a number of countries. For example, it reportedly motivated female university students in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Sierra Leone to protest against sexual violence. Still, in a region where speaking out against such experiences is taboo, residents are more likely to say that movements such as #MeToo have helped reduce harassment and sexual abuse of women in their countries. A median of 52% say such movements help, while 22% say they do not. However, a substantial percentage, 18%, say they have never heard of such movements. Women and men across the region are both more likely to see these movements as helpful than not. A median of 50% of women compared with 52% of men say that these movements help reduce harassment and sexual abuse of women in their countries. These results provide an important baseline to measure Africans' mindsets on women's roles in the not-so-distant future. Harnessing Africans' readiness to have women in leadership positions, whether in politics or at work, is important to building equitable societies. And increasing access to quality education, especially at the university level, will be key to putting African women on their path to such leadership roles for generations to come.

            "text": " State power company Empresa Nacional de Electricidad Bolivia has contracted a pair of Chinese companies to construct the Rositas hydroelectric plant. The deal comes with an initial US$1 billion in financing from the Export-Import Bank of China and will see China Three Gorges Corp. and China International Water & Electric engineer and construct what is expected to be a 500 MW to 600 MW project. HydroWorld.com reported in December that ENDE had called for expressions of interest in a turnkey contract to develop the plant. The project, on the Grande River in Santa Cruz department, will be built to help the country advance toward its goal of having hydropower account for 70% of the energy matrix from 2025, as well as export electricity. Rositas was first proposed in October 1987 under Bolivia\u2019s Law 940, which stated that its construction was a national priority. It\u2019s development has been unsteady, however, with several other foreign groups expressing an interest in building the plant in ensuing years. The Bolivian government now said it hopes to have the plant on line by 2024. For more new development news, visit here. Copyright \u00a9 2019 - 2021"

The supermarket chain says it will work with its 3,000 farmer and grower suppliers to reach the goal within nine years time.   Morrisons expects that the first products to reach net zero carbon status will be eggs as early as 2022.   This would then be followed by lamb, fruit, vegetables, pork and beef in the years to follow.   Research shows that UK agriculture currently accounts for 10 percent of all UK greenhouse gas emissions.   The NFU has asked farmers to work towards a 2040 net zero goal, with the majority of supermarkets working towards 2035.    To kickstart its net zero journey, Morrisons will this month work with farmers and growers to create net zero carbon farm \u2018models\u2019.   They will look at the emissions picture through the whole lifecycle of farm produce - from germination to leaving the farmgate.   Once a workable blueprint has been established, the models will then be shared with all of the retailer's suppliers.   The farm models will look at reducing carbon through rearing different animal breeds, using low food-mile feedstuffs and using renewable energy.   They will also look to offset carbon emissions through planting grassland and clover, restoring peatland and improving soil health.   David Potts, Chief Executive of Morrisons, said: \u201cClimate change is one of the biggest challenges for our generation and growing food is a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.   \"As British farming\u2019s biggest supermarket customer, we\u2019re in a unique position to guide our farms and help lead changes in environmental practices.   \"It\u2019s years ahead of industry expectations - and an ambitious target - but it\u2019s our duty to do it.\u201d    As part of the programme, Morrisons says it will work with universities, vets, farming and countryside organisations and carbon experts.    It will also work with Harper Adams University to set up the world\u2019s first School of Sustainable Farming to offer farming training.

The hydro project is being developed by Chilean power generator Tinguiririca Energia, which is owned by Pacific Hydro and Norway\u2019s SN Power. Tinguiririca also is developing the 155-MW La Confluencia hydro project upstream from La Higuera in the same valley. La Higuera had initially been set to come online in 2009. The project later was expected to come online in June 2010. La Higuera was the first Clean Development Mechanism project registered in Chile and was the largest hydro plant worldwide to obtain CDM certification at the time it was registered in 2006, according to wire reports. Tinguiririca also plans to register La Confluencia as a CDM project. A Bhutan hydro project supported by the Asian Development Bank and the governments of Austria and Japan recently was registered as the first cross-border initiative under the Clean Development Mechanism.

            "text": " Aircraft leasing is on the brink of its biggest shake-up in almost a decade as its top two players AerCap and General Electric\u2019s GECAS discuss a deal to forge an industry titan with over 2,000 jets, financial sources said on Monday. Negotiations for a tie-up follow years of speculation over the sale of GECAS and come as COVID-19 is expected to shift more of the world\u2019s passenger aircraft fleet into the arms of the leasing industry, which already takes about half of Airbus and Boeing deliveries. Advertisement The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the possible deal, valued it at $30 billion and said an announcement could come as early as Monday, barring a last-minute hitch. General Electric (GE) said it did not comment on speculation. AerCap did not respond to requests for comment. New York-listed shares in AerCap jumped 8.25% ahead of the market opening, while GE was up 3%. A deal would be the most ambitious expansion yet under AerCap Chief Executive Aengus Kelly who in 2013 struck a deal to buy the firm\u2019s largest rival, Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corp, in the wale of the financial crisis. It would also mark the latest move by GE Chief Executive Larry Culp to offload businesses and reduce debt, after taking over the reins at the struggling conglomerate in 2018. A tie-up would create comfortably the world\u2019s largest aircraft leasing company, with more than 2,000 aircraft owned or under management and hundreds of planes on order. Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard described the resulting behemoth as the \u201cmother of all leasing companies.\u201d However, if a deal goes ahead, its sheer size could attract attention from antitrust regulators as AerCap and GECAS are already each roughly twice as big in fleet terms as the sector\u2019s third-largest player, Dublin-based Avolon, analysts said. The structure of any deal to acquire GECAS was not immediately clear but several industry sources predicted it would include a similar stock structure that saw ILFC\u2019s insurance owner AIG become a shareholder in the new AerCap. Major leasing companies, which rent out airplanes for a monthly fee, are eyeing growth as airlines focus on repairing balance sheets wrecked by the drop in air travel during the pandemic. DBS analysts said more airlines were expected to shift towards aircraft leasing as they emerge from the crisis.

            "text": " YAGUARAMAS, Cuba, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China delivered two solar panel parks to Cuba on Thursday, as part of bilateral cooperation in renewable energies. In an event held in Yaguaramas town in the central province of Cienfuegos, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Chen Xi handed the management of the two parks over to the Cuban Ministry of Energy and Mines. \"These two parks have a total capacity of 9 megawatts (MW) and the one in Yaguaramas is the largest in Cuba with 19,440 solar panels installed,\" Chen said. After 18 months of construction, the two parks, one in the western province of Pinar del Rio and the other in Yaguaramas, started operations in February. \"This is a sign of friendship and willingness by the Chinese government towards the Cuban people. The confidence, brotherhood and solidarity between our countries grow day by day,\" Chen said. Meanwhile, Cuba's Deputy Minister of Energy and Mines Ruben Cid stressed that these facilities are part of a solar panel project financed by the Ministry of Commerce of China with a total capacity of 21 MW. Cid said China has actively participated in the renewable energy program that seeks to generate 24 percent of electricity in Cuba by 2030. \"To date we have worked intensely with Chinese companies and institutions to carry out two wind farms in the province of Las Tunas, 319 MW in generation through solar panel parks and several bioelectric plants next to sugar refineries,\" he said. He added that Cuba plans to build 25 bioelectric plants with a generation capacity of 755 MW as well as 14 wind farms to produce 656 MW by 2030. Also, the country expects to install a capacity of 700 MW in solar panel parks and build 74 small hydroelectric plants to generate 56 MW.

            "text": "   By The Associated Press Posted Mar 8, 2021 7:44 am EDT Last Updated Mar 8, 2021 at 7:58 am EDT PARIS \u2014 Activists laid flowers near the Iranian Embassy in Paris on Monday to show support for a women\u2019s rights campaigner sentenced to prison after handing out flowers to women on the Tehran metro while not wearing a headscarf. Monday\u2019s protest on a square near the embassy, organized by Amnesty International, was timed to mark International Women\u2019s Day. It was also meant to show support for other activists fighting for human rights in Iran. On International Women\u2019s Day in 2019, Yasaman Aryani, her mother Monireh Arabshahi and Mojgan Keshavarz handed out flowers to female passengers on the Tehran metro and spoke of a day when women have the freedom to choose what they wear. The activists were not wearing headscarves and posted a video showing the action that drew widespread attention. Aryani and her mother were each sentenced to 16 years in prison for \u201cinciting and facilitating corruption and prostitution,\u201d though the sentence was later reduced. Over recent years, dozens of Iranian women have been detained for protesting the mandatory wearing of the hijab. Several women\u2019s rights activists also remain in prison, such as prominent Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh. She became known for defending activists, opposition politicians and women prosecuted for removing their headscarves The hijab and chador \u2014 the flowing, all-encompassing robe for women \u2014 have long been parts of Persian culture. They became political symbols in 1936, when Iran\u2019s pro-Western ruler Reza Shah Pahlavi banned the garments amid his efforts to rapidly modernize Iran. The ban became a source of humiliation for some pious Muslim women in the country. As the 1979 Islamic Revolution took hold, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered female civil servants to wear the chador. The hijab and loose-fitting clothing later became mandatory for all women in Iran.  The Associated Press We've sent an email with instructions to create a new password.

            "text": " Al primer a\u00f1o de inaugurado el r\u00e9gimen de la Revoluci\u00f3n Ciudadana (enero de 2008), el presidente Rafael Correa, puso una de las primer\u00edsimas primeras piedras de sus proyectos estrat\u00e9gicos. Esta vez, para el inicio de la central hidroel\u00e9ctrica Toachi\u200a\u2014\u200aPilat\u00f3n, obra adjudicada entonces a la firma brasile\u00f1a Norberto Odebrecht. Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n, ha sido una de las obras estelares de la constelaci\u00f3n de generadoras hidroel\u00e9ctricas, consideradas la columna vertebral para el cambio de la matriz productiva y la construcci\u00f3n de la publicitada soberan\u00eda energ\u00e9tica. \nTras lanzar \u00e1cidos adjetivos en contra de la \u201cpartidocracia\u201c, acus\u00e1ndola de ser insignia de \u201catraso, ignominia e infamia\u201c, el mandatario colm\u00f3 de elogios a los gestores de la obra, al ex prefecto de Pichincha, Ramiro Gonz\u00e1lez, y a su continuador, Gustavo Baroja, ambos asimilados del viejo partido, Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica. El proyecto costeado a esa fecha en USD 336 millones, fue concebido para generar 234 MW, el cual dejar\u00eda un supuesto ahorro al pa\u00eds de USD 112 millones al a\u00f1o, a partir de 2012, la primera fecha tentativa de inauguraci\u00f3n. En ese entonces el financiamiento fue acordado con el Bandes (Brasil) y el Feiseh (Fondo Ecuatoriano de Inversi\u00f3n en los Sectores Energ\u00e9tico e Hidrocarbur\u00edfero).  Luego de ocho meses de puesta la primera piedra, septiembre de 2008, graves fallas en la hidroel\u00e9ctrica San Francisco, pusieron contra la pared al gobierno, oblig\u00e1ndolo a suspender unilateralmente todos los contratos con la compa\u00f1\u00eda Odebrecht, entre ellos, Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n. La decisi\u00f3n gubernamental implic\u00f3 una serie de acciones legales que le costaron al pa\u00eds rubros adicionales: un fallo de julio de 2010 del Tribunal de Arbitraje de la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Quito, oblig\u00f3 al gobierno a pagar a Odebrecht USD 5.6 millones. La firma brasile\u00f1a nunca reconoci\u00f3 al pa\u00eds un monto de USD 8.24 millones por intereses generados durante once meses, por los USD 112 millones entregados en calidad de adelanto. La firma brasile\u00f1a devolvi\u00f3 al Estado apenas USD 98.3 millones, luego de descontar USD 13.8 millones, correspondiente a avance de obras (v\u00edas de acceso). A partir de entonces, la empresa p\u00fablica Celec Ep, a trav\u00e9s de Hidrotoapi busc\u00f3 nuevos socios para la continuidad del proyecto. En ese camino se asoci\u00f3 con la empresa china CWE (China International Water & Electric Corp.), y la compa\u00f1\u00eda rusa Inter Rao UES, el nuevo financiamiento estuvo a cargo del Eximbank de Rusia y del Biess (Banco del IESS) de Ecuador.  Para el a\u00f1o 2010, las cifras oficiales hablaban de USD 430 millones de inversi\u00f3n, pero al cerrar el 2015, el costo se dispar\u00f3 a USD 588,7 millones. Aunque, despu\u00e9s de revisar la demanda de la empresa rusa INTER RAO UES, que asciende a USD 99.2 millones adicionales, el costo total de Toachi-Pilat\u00f3n hasta 2016, bordear\u00eda los USD 687,9 millones, una cifra que duplica el monto original acordado el a\u00f1o 2008 (USD 336 millones). En esta cifra no se incluyen las p\u00e9rdidas generadas por el finiquito del contrato con Odebrecht que superan los USD 13 millones. El proyecto Toachi\u200a\u2014\u200aPilat\u00f3n, una de las ocho hidroel\u00e9ctricas emblem\u00e1ticas del Gobierno de Rafael Correa -cuya ejecuci\u00f3n est\u00e1 a cargo de la CELEC EP y su unidad de negocio Hidrotoapi (UNHTP) tras una fusi\u00f3n- est\u00e1 al borde de una paralizaci\u00f3n de las obras hidromec\u00e1nicas y, por a\u00f1adidura, de una demanda judicial a nivel internacional. La empresa rusa Inter RAO UES (con 57,34% de acciones del Gobierno ruso, considerado amigo del Ecuador) contratada para realizar las obras electro e hidromec\u00e1nicas del proyecto, amenaza con paralizar dichas obras por falta de pago, amparada en el propio contrato. La acumulaci\u00f3n de deudas por parte de CELEC EP, que van creciendo geom\u00e9tricamente mes a mes, y su falta de financiamiento constituyen el principal motivo. As\u00ed la hidroel\u00e9ctrica Toachi Pilat\u00f3n, que deb\u00eda tener estas obras terminadas para mayo del 2015, en estos d\u00edas est\u00e1 nuevamente en el ojo del hurac\u00e1n. En carta del 1 de diciembre de 2015, dirigida al ministro coordinador de los sectores estrat\u00e9gicos, Rafael Poveda, y con copia al ministro de Electricidad Esteban Albornoz\u00a0y al gerente de CELEC EP, Edmundo Ruales, la empresa\u00a0Inter RAO detalla preocupantes cifras. Los gastos adicionales en los que ha debido incurrir la empresa, por la postergaci\u00f3n del plazo de terminaci\u00f3n del proyecto, llegan a USD 65 millones. Y dice que a fin de acelerar el proceso la empresa decidi\u00f3 iniciar la ejecuci\u00f3n de las obras y actividades adicionales sin esperar la firma de las \u00d3rdenes de Cambio, y ya se han invertido USD 10 millones. Adem\u00e1s explica c\u00f3mo a finales del 2015 los pagos demorados por parte del Gobierno ascend\u00edan a USD 16,9 millones, pero a finales del segundo trimestre del 2016 podr\u00edan llegar a USD 56,2 millones, sin considerar la multa por incumplimiento del contrato. Adem\u00e1s se indica en la carta que CELEC deber\u00eda pagar, incluyendo las obras y actividades adicionales, unos USD 99,2 millones. Estos rubros son adicionales al costo total del proyecto que ha ido incrementando su precio en cuatro a\u00f1os debido a contratos complementarios. En el 2011 el precio oscilaba los USD 517 millones, de los cuales USD 373,2 millones fueron obtenidos en base a financiamiento externo para las obras civiles y el equipamiento hidro y electromec\u00e1nico. Justamente en abril de ese a\u00f1o, Hidrotoapi EP y el Eximbank de Rusia suscribieron un contrato de pr\u00e9stamo para financiar el 85% del contrato de equipamiento hidro-electro mec\u00e1nico del proyecto Toachi\u200a\u2014\u200aPilat\u00f3n, por USD 123, 2 a un plazo de 7,5 a\u00f1os, 4 a\u00f1os de gracia y un inter\u00e9s del 7,90%. Pocos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, el 23 de mayo de 2011, Hidrotoapi E. P. y el Banco del Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social (BIESS), constituyeron el Fideicomiso de Inversi\u00f3n, Administraci\u00f3n, Garant\u00eda y Pago del proyecto hidroel\u00e9ctrico Toachi\u200a\u2014\u200aPilat\u00f3n, designando como Fiduciario a la Corporaci\u00f3n Financiera Nacional, en el cual el BIESS se compromete a aportar USD 250 millones de acuerdo a un cronograma de desembolsos, destinados a la construcci\u00f3n del proyecto a un plazo de 20 a\u00f1os, con 4 a\u00f1os de gracia y un inter\u00e9s del 7,65%. La obra civil qued\u00f3 a cargo de la empresa china CWE (China International Water & Electric Corp.). En la \u00faltima actualizaci\u00f3n de CELEC se puede constatar que el proyecto, que entregar\u00e1 unos 234 MW de potencia, representa una inversi\u00f3n de USD 588,7 millones; sin contar con los gastos adicionales que reporta Inter RAO UES. De acuerdo con la carta de Inter RAO, firmada por el dirigente de la Divisi\u00f3n de Exportaciones del Bloque de Gerencia de Divisiones PJSC, Maxxim Sergeev, el problema surgi\u00f3 por una negligencia de CELEC que, a pesar de oportunas advertencias, no renov\u00f3 la l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito con el banco ruso. Sergeev dice que a la fecha su empresa no conoce ni los plazos ni las fuentes de financiamiento que ha previsto el Ecuador para cubrir los gastos adicionales generados por una serie de retrasos, que considera no imputables a su empresa. La empresa rusa ahora advierte que, de buscarse una renovaci\u00f3n de la l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito, el tr\u00e1mite podr\u00eda concretarse no antes del segundo trimestre del\u00a02016. Toda esta situaci\u00f3n hace prever a la empresa un \u201cescenario pesimista\u201d: sin Plan de Actividades que defina la fuente de financiamiento para la amortizaci\u00f3n de la deuda de CELEC \u201cque sigue acumul\u00e1ndose y la determinaci\u00f3n de las fuentes de financiamiento\u201d, los subcontratistas de la empresa rusa podr\u00edan buscar \u201csuspender la ejecuci\u00f3n de las obras de realizaci\u00f3n del proyecto Toachi Pilat\u00f3n (con las demandas judiciales correspondientes) en vista de evitar p\u00e9rdidas de ambas partes\u201d\u00a0, dice la comunicaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s la empresa aclara a las autoridades ecuatorianas que, de conformidad con las condiciones del Contrato, \u201cen caso de retraso en el pago por parte de CELEC EP por 45 d\u00edas Inter RAO UES tiene derecho de posponer los plazos de culminaci\u00f3n del proyecto y en caso de demora del pago por m\u00e1s de 60 d\u00edas, suspender la ejecuci\u00f3n del proyecto\u201d. El impasse con Inter RAO ya ha llegado a las m\u00e1s altas esferas del r\u00e9gimen. As\u00ed en los primeros d\u00edas de diciembre, el embajador de Ecuador en Rusia, Julio Prado, ped\u00eda al canciller Ricardo Pati\u00f1o que intervenga en el problema: \u201cLo que m\u00e1s me preocupa es que por primera vez la empresa ya habla de un juicio contra el Estado por incumplimiento lo cual tu comprender\u00e1s ser\u00eda extremadamente grave, adem\u00e1s que se paralizar\u00edan las obras en las cuales el se\u00f1or Presidente ha puesto tanto inter\u00e9s concluyan en este a\u00f1o o inicios del 2016 y que al parecer no suceder\u00e1\u201d, indicaba Prado en una comunicaci\u00f3n. El funcionario diplom\u00e1tico tambi\u00e9n dejaba ver su preocupaci\u00f3n de que Inter RAO ponga en conocimiento del Presidente Vladimir Putin este asunto \u201cno s\u00f3lo por lo que pueda manifestar sino porque sus propios intereses est\u00e1n en juego y la decisi\u00f3n puede ser muy dura\u201d, aseguraba.  Seguramente se refer\u00eda a que seg\u00fan informaci\u00f3n internacional, Inter RAO es en un 28% propiedad del holding estatal de energ\u00eda OAO Rosneftegaz, que est\u00e1 presidido por Igor Sechin, director general de OAO Rosneft y un aliado y parte del c\u00edrculo \u00edntimo del presidente Putin. El embajador tambi\u00e9n hac\u00eda menci\u00f3n a la opini\u00f3n que Sergeev le hab\u00eda hecho conocer, en el sentido de que la impresi\u00f3n que tiene el funcionario ruso es que Celec no quiere informar al Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica lo que en verdad pasa con los proyectos, sobre todo en Toachi Pilat\u00f3n, en el que hay muchos problemas. Sergeev le hab\u00eda comentado que \u201cen Rusia ya nadie conf\u00eda en Celec\u201d. Reiter\u00f3 que Celec no propone fechas ni planes para solucionar los problemas, as\u00ed como no ha mandado informaci\u00f3n alguna de la que precisa el banco. Adicionalmente, manifest\u00f3 que ahora dadas las circunstancias, el banco desea que se practique una auditor\u00eda t\u00e9cnica para saber qu\u00e9 es lo que pasa en las obras de construcci\u00f3n y que, de acuerdo al contrato, lo que generar\u00e1 una planilla que deber\u00e1 pagar Celec. Sobre la fecha de entrega de la obra manifest\u00f3 que esta no podr\u00e1 estar lista en junio de 2016, sino reci\u00e9n en febrero de 2017. El plazo inicial de terminaci\u00f3n de la mega obra (incluyendo obras civiles e hidro y electromec\u00e1nicas) era mayo del 2015. Sin embargo una cadena de errores e ineficiencias lo han ido extendiendo. En agosto del 2014 varios medios, incluidos los oficialistas daban por hecho que la central hidroel\u00e9ctrica se inaugurar\u00eda en agosto de 2015. Sin embargo para diciembre del 2014 ya se conoci\u00f3 que el Gobierno autoriz\u00f3 una ampliaci\u00f3n del plazo de diez meses (octubre del 2015). Al llegar dicha fecha, seg\u00fan el Ministerio de Electricidad, solo se hab\u00eda avanzado en un 77,78% de toda la obra. La Contralor\u00eda General del Estado en el examen especial DAPyA 0054 2015, que hizo a la obra se\u00f1ala lo que ser\u00eda el origen de los problemas del proyecto y su err\u00e1tica ejecuci\u00f3n. Explica que previo a los procesos de contrataci\u00f3n de las obras civiles y electro e hidromec\u00e1nicas, la UNHTP \u201cno cont\u00f3 con los dise\u00f1os definitivos del proyecto, lo que ocasion\u00f3 que el dise\u00f1o de detalle, contratado para ser realizado simult\u00e1neamente a la ejecuci\u00f3n del proyecto, se retrase por inconvenientes administrativos de demora en la entrega de informaci\u00f3n de los componentes electromec\u00e1nicos\u201d. El no contar con esa informaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica tambi\u00e9n caus\u00f3 retraso en la aprobaci\u00f3n de planos de detalle y deficiente estudio geol\u00f3gico del frente de trabajo Alluriqu\u00edn y en la presa Toachi. Dichos estudios, dise\u00f1os, y planos debidamente terminados y aprobados le hubieran servido a la empresa representante del Gobierno ecuatoriano para verificar problemas de dise\u00f1o y realizar un c\u00e1lculo adecuado del costo real de la obra y su plazo de ejecuci\u00f3n. Ahora el nuevo plazo anunciado es junio del 2016. Sin embargo, se trata de un l\u00edmite que no es definitivo. En su carta Sergeev explica que es muy dif\u00edcil establecer el plazo ya que hasta el momento Inter RAO desconoce las fechas reales en las que le entregar\u00e1n los frentes de los trabajos por parte del contratista civil; tampoco se conocen las fechas de suscripci\u00f3n de \u00d3rdenes de Cambio debido a las obras y actividades adicionales de Inter RAO en el marco del proyecto. En el examen de la Contralor\u00eda se indica que seg\u00fan comunicaciones de la empresa Inter RAO, dichas obras no podr\u00edan estar antes de diciembre de 2016. Ahora habla de febrero de 2017, lo cual ser\u00eda un contratiempo para los planes de cambio de matriz energ\u00e9tica ofertado por el Gobierno ecuatoriano. Pese a la postura de Inter RAO UES, la Contralor\u00eda encuentra, a m\u00e1s de una serie de faltas cometidas por la UNHTP, tambi\u00e9n responsabilidades de la empresa rusa. En el informe la Contralor\u00eda explica que esta inici\u00f3 la ejecuci\u00f3n de los contratos con retraso en los diferentes frentes de trabajo. Adem\u00e1s asegura que no present\u00f3 oportunamente el cronograma de ejecuci\u00f3n, ni de montaje de equipo electro e hidromec\u00e1nico, conforme lo establece el contrato pese a las reiteradas solicitudes por parte del Administrador del contrato y la fiscalizaci\u00f3n al modificar unilateralmente el programa de ejecuci\u00f3n del contrato inobserv\u00f3 las cl\u00e1usulas 13.1, 13,2 y 16.1 ocasionando retrasos en la ejecuci\u00f3n de su contrato y del contratista de la obra civil. Pero una vez m\u00e1s, la Contralor\u00eda responsabiliza al Administrador (parte de Hidrotoapi) de no evaluar adecuadamente el cumplimiento del avance del contrato de obras electromec\u00e1nicas e hidromec\u00e1nicas. Tambi\u00e9n indica que no comunic\u00f3 a la m\u00e1xima autoridad de la Unidad de Negocio Celec EP Hidrotoapi, sobre los incumplimientos contractuales incurridos; y tampoco sobre la necesidad de suscribir un contrato complementario.  Adem\u00e1s advierte que en caso de que la contratista no efect\u00fae la instalaci\u00f3n de la \u00faltima unidad en la fecha programada para la recepci\u00f3n provisional, el administrador del contrato debe aplicar la cl\u00e1usula 13.6 y proceder con el tr\u00e1mite de las sanciones que correspondan.  \u00bfC\u00f3mo entra la empresa rusa INTER RAO UES, Empresa Estatal de la Federaci\u00f3n de Rusia con participaci\u00f3n accionario del 57,34% del Gobierno de Rusia en esta intrincada estructura para llevar adelante el proyecto hidroel\u00e9ctrico? La historia data del 29 de octubre de 2009 cuando Hidrotoapi S.A., JSC INTER RAO UES, y el Banco Estatal Especializado de Exportaci\u00f3n\u200a\u2014\u200aImportaci\u00f3n de Rusia (Roseximbank), suscriben una \u201cCarta de Intenci\u00f3n firme para Desarrollo de Proyectos Hidroel\u00e9ctricos bajo R\u00e9gimen Especial de Contrataci\u00f3n\u201d, a fin de adquirir los suministros electro e hidromec\u00e1nicos para el proyecto. Para el 13 de mayo de 2010 se celebra una nueva carta de intenci\u00f3n con Inter RAO y el 22 de junio de 2010 ya se hace la propuesta econ\u00f3mica: USD 144,9 millones lo que incluye todos los equipos, actividades y repuestos solicitados y se indica que \u201cno se encuentra sujeto a reajuste de precios\u201d. As\u00ed tras la autorizaci\u00f3n de rigor del directorio, el 21 de octubre de 2010, el gerente general de Hidrotoapi E.P. con resoluci\u00f3n 158 resolvi\u00f3 contratar directamente la \u201cFabricaci\u00f3n, Suministro, Transporte, Montaje, Pruebas, Puesta en Servicio y Entrega en Perfecto Funcionamiento, de todas las Obras Electro e Hidromec\u00e1nicas para los aprovechamientos Sarapullo y Alluriqu\u00edn que conforma en proyecto Hidroel\u00e9ctrico Toachi\u200a\u2014\u200aPilat\u00f3n\u201d, con la empresa INTER RAO UES. El 25 de octubre de 2010 ya se firma el contrato. En \u00e9l se establece que la entrega se har\u00e1 a satisfacci\u00f3n y se se\u00f1ala la obligaci\u00f3n de la contratista de proveer la informaci\u00f3n de los materiales, para que la contratante realice cualquier inspecci\u00f3n, correcci\u00f3n, observaci\u00f3n o reclamo. El costo es de USD 144,9 millones, de los cuales USD 123,2 millones son financiados por el Roseximbank y USD 21,7 por la contratante. Tambi\u00e9n se deja sentado que no podr\u00e1 haber ajuste de precio pues es \u201ccontrato a precio fijo, modalidad llave en mano\u201d, con un plazo de 44 meses, contado desde la fecha programada de inicio.  Entre tanto, la empresa estatal ecuatoriana sufri\u00f3 una serie de transformaciones en el tiempo. El 25 de agosto de 2005, con un capital social de USD 54.000 de acciones a nombre del Consejo Provincial de Pichincha, se constituye la empresa Hidrotoapi encargada del dise\u00f1o, construcci\u00f3n, instalaci\u00f3n, operaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de centrales de generaci\u00f3n el\u00e9ctrica, la cual ten\u00eda la posibilidad de realizar toda clase de actos, contratos, negocios y operaciones permitidas por la Ley. En el 2008 esta empresa cambia de denominaci\u00f3n a Hidrotoapi EP para dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, el 28 de octubre de 2010, suscribir un Convenio de Alianza Estrat\u00e9gica para el desarrollo del proyecto Toachi\u200a\u2014\u200aPilat\u00f3n y compromiso de fusi\u00f3n con CELEC EP. As\u00ed para enero del 2012 mediante Resoluci\u00f3n 001\u20132012 de 26 y 31 de enero de 2012, se aprueba la fusi\u00f3n por absorci\u00f3n de Hidrotoapi EP por parte de la Corporaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador, CELEC EP, como entidad absorbente, disponiendo su disoluci\u00f3n sin liquidaci\u00f3n desde el 1 de febrero de 2012. De esta manera se transfiere a t\u00edtulo universal, la totalidad de los patrimonios, activos y pasivos de Hidrotoapi a favor de CELEC EP. Adem\u00e1s del contrato de Toachi\u200a\u2014\u200aPilat\u00f3n, la firma INTER RAO UES, de la mano del Eximbank de Rusia, suscribi\u00f3 un convenio por USD 195.2 millones, para la construcci\u00f3n y financiamiento del proyecto de generaci\u00f3n de 187 MW, denominado Termogas Machala, en la provincia de El Oro, el proyecto debi\u00f3 entrar en operaci\u00f3n el 2016, otra fecha de ejecuci\u00f3n incumplida. Inter Rao y Roseximbank suscribieron otros acuerdos con el Gobierno ecuatoriano, como la construcci\u00f3n y financiamiento de los proyectos hidroel\u00e9ctricos Cardenillo (596MW), en Morona Santiago y Chontal(190MW), ubicado entre las provincias de Pichincha e Imbabura. Ya no es noticia que una compa\u00f1\u00eda china no se sujete a la normativa nacional. La afectaci\u00f3n a los derechos laborales acumula folios en la instituci\u00f3n de control. No se diga el tema ambiental: la Contralor\u00eda del Estado en su informe del a\u00f1o 2013, DAPyA-0002\u20132013, presenta graves conclusiones en contra de la constructora china CWE. Las observaciones de la auditor\u00eda apuntan que se viol\u00f3 e incumpli\u00f3 el contrato, en relaci\u00f3n a la perforaci\u00f3n de los t\u00faneles: \u201cla excavaci\u00f3n y sostenimiento de t\u00faneles, se ejecut\u00f3 sin cumplir los dise\u00f1os, planos y especificaciones t\u00e9cnicas\u201c, precisa el informe. Adem\u00e1s, de que la compa\u00f1\u00eda \u201cno cuenta con el n\u00famero de ge\u00f3logos suficientes para realizar el registro geol\u00f3gico, geomec\u00e1nico de la roca excavada\u201c. El informe agrega que, \u201chasta la fecha de corte de la evaluaci\u00f3n, la contratista no cont\u00f3 con un laboratorio de suelos y hormigones, que permita realizar un control de calidad del hormig\u00f3n incorporado al proyecto\u201c. El maltrato a los trabajadores por parte de la compa\u00f1\u00eda china CWE lleg\u00f3 a niveles de alarma de la propia administraci\u00f3n de Hidrotoapi y del Gobierno. A trav\u00e9s de una carta de agosto de 2012, las autoridades el\u00e9ctricas pidieron la remoci\u00f3n del Superintendente del proyecto, acus\u00e1ndole de violar derechos laborales b\u00e1sicos, como: alimentaci\u00f3n digna, provisi\u00f3n de ropa de trabajo, esparcimiento y seguridad laboral.

            "text": " GEORGETOWN  GUYANESE have long dreamed of harnessing their powerful rivers for hydroelectricity. Instead, they rely on imported oil for intermittent and expensive power. Now the government wants to move forward with an $840m project at Amaila Falls, deep in the forested interior. At full capacity of 165MW, it could supply more power than Guyana\u2019s present needs. The lead developer is Sithe Global, part of the Blackstone Group. Sithe wants a guaranteed 19% return on its equity stake, and plans to start construction this year. China Railway First Group signed an engineering contract in September. The China Development Bank will lend most of the money. The Inter-American Development Bank has been asked to chip in $175m; the World Bank was initially involved, but has pulled out. Amaila\u2019s supporters point out that it will flood less than 55 square km (21 square miles). No villages will be displaced and little wildlife will be disturbed. Guyana would no longer rely on fossil fuels for electricity. After two decades, ownership would pass to the government, construction costs paid off. Opponents worry that clean electricity will not come cheap. Guyana Power and Light (GPL), the state-owned electricity company, will pay about $100m a year to the Amaila consortium. Electricity bills are unlikely to fall (three people were killed last year in protests over electricity charges). And Amaila\u2019s power may not be reliable. The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern can bring a year-long drought. In normal years, the plant will run below capacity between October and April. GPL will have to pay for backup thermal power. The IMF has urged \u201ccareful consideration of the [financial] risks\u201d. Plans to build Amaila date from 1997, though Sithe only got involved in 2009. The estimated cost has risen steadily. An access road is unfinished. There is as yet no economic feasibility study for the project; when completed, the study will remain confidential, as is GPL\u2019s outline power-purchase agreement. Opposition parties complain that the government is being \u201csecretive\u201d about Amaila. On April 24th they blocked funds for a government equity-stake in the project. If Amaila is as beneficial as its backers claim, an open debate might generate broader support for the project, and cut its $56m bill for political risk insurance.

Sign Up The PPP/C\u2019s flagship hydropower project at Amaila Falls, which was canned by the APNU+AFC administration back in late 2017, will be resuscitated, Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo says even as the new government forges ahead with the construction of the Kato hydropower project as part of its future energy mix. \u201cWe are going to go back to hydro and an energy mix \u2013 hydro, wind, solar; all of them. Amaila would be part of that too,\u201d Jagdeo told Stabroek News. \u201cNot just Amaila but there are also some mini ones and we have to review if they are feasible,\u201d he added. The 165 MW, US$858.1m Amaila Falls Hydropower Plan (AFHP) had been the flagship project of the PPP/C government when it was in power pre-2015. But while in opposition, both A Partnership for National Unity (APNU) and the Alliance For Change (AFC) had had deep reservations about it over cost, feasibility and other matters.\u00a0 This opposition to the project had resulted in the main investor, Sithe Global pulling out of the Region Eight project on August 9, 2013. APNU and AFC had a one-seat majority in the 2011 Parliament and were therefore able to successfully oppose the project. Although Jagdeo had pleaded with the APNU+AFC government, when it took office in 2015, to continue a conversation on the project and ensure that it was restarted, Minister of State Joseph Harmon made an announcement in October of 2017 that the project had been canned. He had told this newspaper in an exclusive interview that his government was focusing on an energy mix with natural gas as a prime component. Harmon had said the AFHP was too costly to explore and the government did not have the financial wherewithal or Sithe\u2019s intellectual property documents at its disposal. Given those circumstances, he said it would be virtually impossible to enlist a new investor and as such a decision was taken to look at other energy alternatives. Asked specifically if that meant that the government was not prepared to go out and find another investor, Harmon replied. \u201cNo. The point is are you going to give us money to do that?\u201d The then Minister of State had explained that with an estimated \u201cUS billion-dollar\u201d AFHP project, government could not fund it on its own even if it accessed the US$80M that the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) was then holding through an agreement with Norway as Guyana\u2019s equity in the project. For the Government of Guyana, he explained, the case for producing energy through AFHP, was not as easy as many believed since there were myriad questions left unanswered and a fact-based assessment by consulting company, Norconsult, highlighted these facts. \u00a0The Norconsult report, which was meant to be a final study of the AFHP and commissioned under the Guyana-Norway partnership, was generally favourable towards the AFHP but the APNU+AFC government interpreted it differently. Engaging Jagdeo told Stabroek News last week that the Irfaan Ali government will re-engage in discussions with Norway soon but would not say if it would be to help find funding on the project.\u00a0 \u201cWe will be speaking to Norway shortly,\u201d he said, as he explained that last week government had been engaging a number of countries and multinational agencies. He did, however, reveal that discussions on another climate change agreement with Oslo is \u201cdefinitely on the cards\u2026We just want to get the budget out of the way,\u201d he said Jagdeo\u2019s announcement was followed by Minister of Public Works Juan Edghill echoing that the energy mix will be a sustainable one, as he declared the restart of the 150KW hydropower project at Region 8. \u201cIt is one that we had initiated when we built the school (Kato Secondary School) and there would be extra [power] for the community. So it is continuing,\u201d Edghill told Stabroek News. With financing from the Global Environment Facility under the sustainability energy programme for Guyana, a US$2.2M\u00a0 contract for the \u201cDesign, Supply and Installation of a 150KW hydropower plant on the Chiung River, at Kato Village, in Region Eight\u201d was signed by the APNU+AFC government in September of last year. This contract was awarded to B & J Civil Works and then Minister of Public Infrastructure David Patterson had said that it would be a \u201cwin-win\u201d for the Region, since upon its completion it would make Kato the first Indigenous village and only community within the country to be powered by 100% renewable energy. But the project was paused due to the political impasse and a signal of its restart came yesterday with the advertising for a Clerk-of-Works by the Ministry of Public Works. Edghill said that the project was \u201cone of several that were committed to and had funding\u201d. The project is expected to run for a period of 18 months with a 12 months defects liability period after the completion of the project, the Ministry had explained. The project comprises three components: The construction of 150KW hydropower plant on the bank of the Chiung River. Inclusive of wire, intake, headrace canal with sand trap, forebay, penstock and power house; the construction of 13.8KV Transmis-sion Network (Kato Hydro Station, Secondary School and Kato Village); and the construction of 120V Distribution Network in Kato Village. According to the ministry, the objective of the project is to provide Kato and government facilities and the Kato Secondary School with a relatively cheap and reliable source of power that will result in livelihood enhancements. It added that homes that are located within the proximity of the distribution grid are expected to receive power in the initial stage of the project. Additionally, at the school, electricity will be available in the evening for the students to read, write and study. It was also noted that power will be available during the day at the school to facilitate the use of power tools and equipment for technical and vocational training. Power will also be used for the pumping of water to ensure proper sanitation in the dormitory facilities. A FREE roundup of top news from Guyana you might otherwise miss. Delivered every morning."

This time, the issue involves ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule and his apparent call for ANC Members of Parliament to oppose efforts to remove Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane from office. Mkhwebana is a hired gun not the public protector.  Mbalula has accused Magashule of acting outside of the ANC mandate and has therefore distorted the party\u2019s image and policy. Mbalula\u2019s statement against Magashule has solicited insults from former Nelson Mandela Bay councillor Andile Lungisa, who has called the Transport minister a political prostitute. Mbalula, aka the political prostitute, is a shameless hack who administers fellatio to any man in a positioning power. This is a consequence of taking pills when you went through initiation.  The only reason you would not participate is because it would jeopardise your stomach and your tax payer funded lifestyle. pic.twitter.com/3oM8mWlkX4  Lungisa and Mbalula have had public spats dating as far back as 2012 when Lungisa opposed Mbalula\u2019s campaign to become ANC secretary-general during the party\u2019s elective congress that year. MKMVA spokesperson Carl Niehaus has been among those who\u2019ve endorsed Lungisa\u2019s statement on Twitter. Hmmmm, so rich coming from a person of interest in the Bozwana murder. By the way, did you pay back the R1-million Bozwana loaned you for your Las Vegas frolic before he was mysteriously murdered?https://t.co/6rJ853uaFh  Mbalula has not taken kindly to this and has accused Niehaus of being a criminal. The minister has previously said that members of the MKMVA are fighting with him because he stopped irregular security contracts at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) which the veterans had interests in.

Meanwhile, Waldo Albarrac\u00edn says the consultancy study was never made public  The analysis carried out by the UMSA observes serious risk to the environment if the Bala y Chepete hydroelectric project is executed, and also maintains that the yields are economically doubtful. The Bala and Chepete hydroelectric plants, located in northern La Paz and part of Beni, could cause serious consequences for the environment and surrounding communities, according to a technical and scientific study conducted by professionals from the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s (UMSA) that declares the construction of the project unfeasible. The document adds to the opposition current that is against the two hydroelectric plants, which also argue the damage that will be caused to the populations of the area, such as Rurrenabaque and San Buenaventura. According to information from the National Electricity Company (ENDE), on the website, the El Bala Narrow Hydroelectric project is one of the most historic aspirations in the country, it is a National Interest and Priority project. [Bolivian Thoughts opinion: undeniably, it was an aspiration back in time when we didn\u2019t know about the impact of dams around the world, it was an ideal to follow around mid 20th century \u2026 now it is bot viable on many grounds, and even the technology to transport this energy to a far away border with Brazil, makes it unfeasible. The most valuable National Park, the Madidi will be put under serious peril, the most diverse ecosystem will be in danger. And just to please an ochlocrat that dreams with state-owned enterprises, which are not competitive nor sustainable by simple definition.] \u201cThe El Bala hydroelectric project would guarantee energy sovereignty for our country, under the new conception it has multiple benefits.

In this regard, the rector of the UMSA, Waldo Albarrac\u00edn, indicated that the studies carried out by a consultant were never made public and requested as an academy, but they also received no response. He also warned that if the project is carried out it will imply materializing an ecocide, even the overflow of water will make two towns disappear, Rurrenabaque and San Buenaventura. https://www.eldiario.net/noticias/2019/2019_09/nt190919/principal.php?n=66&-umsa-declara-inviable-al-proyecto-chepete-bala   Indigenous people question misuse of prior consultation for Chepete and El Bala projects \u2013 Ind\u00edgenas cuestionan mal uso de consulta previa para proyectos Chepete y El\u00a0BalaAugust 30, 2021In \"Beni\" Chepete and El Bala dams outline evo\u2019s character: he is NOT pro environment NOR indigenous\u00a0rights!August 21, 2018In \"Bolivia\" Bolivian indigenous people confirm rejection of\u00a0dams!March 17, 2018In \"Beni\" \n\t\tSenior managerial experience on sustainable development projects.\t\t\n\t\t\tView more posts\t\t\n Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: \n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Google account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n Connecting to %s  Notify me of new comments via email.

            "text": " \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t As Evo Morales revives a controversial China-backed dam, local communities renew their fight against it \nMiriam Telma Jemio February 20, 2019\n  Share Part of the R\u00edo Grande passes through the Tatarenda Grande indigenous community, which would be submerged by the Rositas dam (image: Miriam Telma Jemio) The Bolivian government wants to build a hydroelectric plant in the east of the country that it claims will lessen its dependence on fossil fuels whilst guaranteeing energy and water supplies. On December 31, President Evo Morales proposed a referendum to revive the Rositas project, which would displace communities in the department of Santa Cruz. Ever since, conflict has threatened to escalate. Generating energy is a priority for Santa Cruz. With 3.2 million inhabitants, it is Bolivia\u2019s most populous department and faces growing demand. The Rositas project, promoted by the national government and implemented by the state-owned ENDE Corporation (National Electricity Corporation), would have serious impacts. These include the resettlement of at least 12 nearby communities that live off dairy farming and agriculture. For the past three years, these 500 families have voiced fears about having to leave the homes they have occupied for 40 years. For Morales, Rositas \u2013 a project originally conceived in the 1970s \u2013 remains a priority. In 2016, the government awarded the contract to construct the dam to the AAR Consortium (Asociaci\u00f3n Accidental Rositas), part of the state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation, along with its subsidiary China International Water & Electric and the Bolivian construction company, Reedco S.R.L. The project\u2019s total cost is US$1.3 billion, 85% of which will be financed by the Chinese state-owned Eximbank.     On several occasions, Morales has reiterated the importance of the dam and warned it could divert resources for Rositas to other departments if it doesn\u2019t go ahead. \u201cIf there are some families that oppose it, why not hold a referendum and ask the department whether or not it should be done?\u201d Morales said in departmental capital Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Local communities immediately rejected the proposal. \u201cA referendum has no role in a matter like this. They had ample opportunity to hold free, prior and informed consultations. A referendum does not make sense, as it is private property,\u201d said Benigno Barrientos, a representative of Moroco, one of the 12 affected communities. \u201cThey have only spoken about the benefits of energy. They want to guarantee water for consumption in Santa Cruz and water for irrigation, but they don\u2019t talk about the damage that the project will cause, nor do they talk about compensation,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Sandoval, president of the Land and Territory Defence Committee, a community organisation set up by affected communities. \u201cWe are rejecting it because of its lack of transparency.\u201d The Rositas project is designed to generate some 600 megawatts (MW) of energy. Bolivia\u2019s current grid capacity is 1400MW, of which it consumes 1200MW. However, the project has even greater ambitions. It is an integral part of Morales\u2019 2025 Patriotic Agenda, a plan to turn Bolivia into a regional energy hub that can generate 3000MW, exporting that not used in Bolivia to Argentina and Brazil. Slated for construction 140 kilometres from the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Rositas would be the first of seven hydroelectric dams in the R\u00edo Grande basin. The source of the Rio Grande lies in the centre of the country and flows into the Amazon to the north. According to former Energy Minister Luis Alberto S\u00e1nchez, beyond generating energy the dam would irrigate 164,000 hectares of agricultural land, supply drinking water to Santa Cruz and reduce the risk of flooding downstream. So far, neither ENDE nor the government has released information on the potential impact of the project. However, a study by the NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Sol\u00f3n identifies a 452-square kilometre affected area that straddles five municipalities: Guti\u00e9rrez and Cabezas in the Cordillera province, Postrervalle and Vallegrande in Santa Cruz\u2019s Vallegrande province, and Villa Vaca Guzm\u00e1n in the neighbouring department of Chuquisaca. Farming communities initially became concerned in 2012 when an initial feasibility study showed a 45,000 hectare area that would be subject to flooding.     They also fear the loss of existing infrastructure, including schools, roads, and power lines. A 38 million boliviano (US$5.5 million) bridge over the R\u00edo Grande, which is almost operational, is located in the area to be flooded, according to NGO Probioma. The bridge joins the municipalities of Vallegrande and Guti\u00e9rrez and has been promoted by the Bolivian Roads Authority as a means of transporting products such as corn, potatoes, peanuts, and other vegetables to markets in Santa Cruz, Bolivia\u2019s second city. In December 2016, at a gathering in the indigenous community of Tatarenda Nuevo, the Committee for the Defence of Land and Territory of Communities Affected by the Rositas Project voted to reject construction of the project owing to its impacts. They say there has been no free, prior and informed consultation on the project, as mandated by Bolivia\u2019s Constitution and the International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) Convention 169 on indigenous people, which Bolivia has ratified. Three of the affected communities are indigenous Guaran\u00ed. Faced with what they describe as unresponsiveness to requests for information on Rositas\u2019 impacts and alternatives, in May 2017, the Committee decided not to attend any further gatherings related to the project. From that moment, the communities\u2019 struggle became a legal matter. In March 2018, the Guaran\u00ed communities of Tatarenda Nuevo and Yumao took them to court for violating their rights. After going through three different courts, a judge ruled against the complaint, arguing; \u201cthe plaintiffs cannot be considered affected when there are no regulations, or an active project, nor can they claim to be affected until studies are concluded that must be carried out by ENDE prior to the consultation\u201d. No referendum should deal with something that is illegal The studies are not publicly available, nor have they been completed. The first, a final design study that establishes the affected area, was carried out by the company Eptisa, but to date, it has not been published. The status of the second, the environmental impact assessment, is uncertain despite ENDE subsidiary Corani S.A. winning the contract to carry it out in August 2017. Finally, the study for the irrigation project involving 165,000 hectares of agricultural land was awarded in January 2018 to Spanish consortium Inclam S.A. for US$2.4 million with funds from the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF). It is expected later this month. Indigenous communities say the courts did not take into account documents substantiating how they would be affected by the flooding and their \u201cinvoluntary re-settlement\u201d.     Environmentalists are also worried about the project\u2019s impact on the humid forests of the R\u00edo Grande basin. The affected area encompasses three protected areas: the I\u00f1ao National Park; the R\u00edo Grande Integrated Area\u2013 Valles Cruce\u00f1os; and the Paraban\u00f3 Municipal Protected Area. \u201cProtected areas are enshrined in the Constitution and there are other regulations that forbid activities being carried out,\u201d said environmental researcher Cecilia Requena, co-author of the book \u2018Bolivia in a 4-degree warmer world\u2019. \u201cNo referendum should deal with something that is illegal. That is, carrying out infrastructural work or any public work that affects the function for which it has been created,\u201d she added. Rositas would enable Bolivia to significantly transform its energy matrix. The government says new hydroelectric plants would replace energy generated by natural gas and diesel with water, a renewable source. In doing so, it would cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Today, gas- and diesel-powered thermoelectric plants produce 75% of Bolivia\u2019s electricity. The Defence Committee\u2019s opposition to Rositas is awkward for the government. \u201cWe call on the Santa Cruz people to defend their project \u2014the dream of the old people who envisioned this project,\u201d said Energy Minister Rafael Alarc\u00f3n, who described those filing legal action against Rositas as \u201cbad people\u201d. ENDE, the energy ministry of Energy, and the governing body of Santa Cruz say they will find out who should be compensated by the project and stress the measures to prevent environmental degradation.     Communities, however, say information is vague. \u201cWe are not aware of any proposals. We don\u2019t have to accept anything if we don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Benigno Barrientos, vice-chairman of the Defence Committee. \u201cAt no time have we been shown the best or the worst [scenarios]. What private owner is going to hand over his property without a proposal?\u201d They insist that rather than the referendum, there must be a process of prior consultation. \u201cOur position is that any attempted consultation now is wrongly timed, bearing in mind that consultation with indigenous communities should have taken place beforehand,\u201d said Ena Taborga, representative of the Guaran\u00ed community of Tatarenda Nuevo. She added: \u201cConsulting all Bolivians would violate, among other rights, our self-determination.\u201d Sara Crespo, a researcher at Probioma, agrees: \u201cIt was not done beforehand. That right is already violated and nothing is being done to provide compensation.\u201d No Santa Cruz native, no Bolivian, is going to like the government taking away an inherent right by a referendum Nor do many believe the government will comply if the result goes against them. Morales lost a February 2016 national referendum on whether he could seek another presidential term. He will run for office again in October this year. The government says the referendum would take precedence but insists on the importance of considering agreeable alternatives. \u201cThere has to be consensus between the different levels of government and the affected population in order to seek positive solutions and avoid a referendum,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Parada, an advisor to the Santa Cruz government. He added: \u201cNobody is going to oppose the implementation of 200,000 hectares of irrigation, generating energy, or having public and private electric transport. The referendum is secondary to the importance the project will have.\u201d For the time being, attempts at dialogue are paralysed. The Ministry of Energy did not respond to Di\u00e1logo Chino\u2019s request for information on what action they will take to make Morales\u2019 referendum proposal viable, merely pointing out that they are collecting water data. Meanwhile, anti-dam protesters\u2019 frustration at the lack of information on Rositas simmers. \u201cNo Santa Cruz native, no Bolivian, is going to like the government taking away an inherent right by a referendum. For three years, we have asked for proposals but have got none,\u201d said Benigno Barrientos. \n            You can republish our articles for free under the Creative Commons licence.\n           \n\t\tSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news & analysis on China, Latin America and the environment\n\t Impacts and innovations in a key sector for China and Latin America  Mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to cleaner economies   Natural resources and responsible extraction   Bridging Latin America's infrastructure gap sustainably   The drivers, actors and institutions behind the billions  Follow A chinadialogue partner site.\nFind out more\n Dialogo Chino uses cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

            "text": " TOBAGO HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY   \u201cWe are experiencing a smooth transition from the existing Scarborough Regional Hospital to the new Scarborough General Hospital,\u201d said the Division of Health and Social Services Secretary Claudia Groome-Duke at the Executive Council Media Briefing on Wednesday (April 18, 2012). \u201cThe following outpatient clinics are now available at the new Scarborough General Hospital. Gynecology and Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Developmental Pediatrics, General Surgery, Urology, Internal Medicine, General Medicine, Nephrology, Hematology, Dermatology, and Rheumatology. And I want the public to note that the Eye and Orthopedic Clinics are still at the Scarborough Regional Hospital.\u201d Other services that are available at the new Scarborough General Hospital are CAT scans, mammography screenings, bone density scans, fluoroscopy and ultrasound. The mortuary is also operational. The Health Secretary said ninety-seven patients were seen on April 11th, forty-five on April 12th, and fifty-nine on April 13th, 2012. The Health Secretary said she had received a document from NIPDEC the day before regarding the construction cost of the new hospital which stated that $155.6 million had been paid to NH International Caribbean Limited for the first hospital contract. NIPDEC indicated this figure could be reduced by $2 million since the company had won in arbitration against NH International Caribbean Limited. The Chinese Railway Construction Limited company had a contract for $477.7 million which included an increased scope of services that were not part of the initial NHIC construction contract. These services included a new biomedical centre, the expansion of the accident and emergency ward, and the installation of furniture and fixtures. This brought the building total for the new hospital to $633.3 million During the briefing, the Secretary of Finance and Enterprise Development Dr Anselm London said the Tobago Regional Health Authority had been allocated $281 million by Parliament, of which $100 million was still due to the THA. The Finance Secretary said after months of back and forth, the money had not been received, presenting a strain to the TRHA and the Assembly. He noted that the THA was concerned about remarks the Minister of Tobago Development Vernelle Alleyne Toppin recently made on air expressing uncertainty of whether the money will come to Tobago, which went against statements made by Finance Minister Winston Dookeran. Dookeran said the Assembly could apply for the money again. \u201cThis is not a gift to Tobago. It is decision made by Parliament,\u201d Dr London said. He indicated that if the funds were not received, it would be equaled to a 5.55% reduction in Tobago\u2019s allocation, which the Assembly could not afford. It would also be a violation of the terms of the Dispute Resolution Commission because the allocation to Tobago was exactly 4.03 percent. He indicated that he hoped Minister Toppin\u2019s comments were inaccurate. The following are the hours of services provided at the Scarborough General Hospital. All services are by appointment or referral system between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic will be open all day on Mondays and on Wednesdays in the afternoon. The Pediatrics Clinic will be opened on Tuesday mornings, Developmental Pediatrics on Friday mornings, General Surgery on Thursday mornings, Urology on Fridays from 2:00 p.m, Internal Medicine on Tuesday afternoons and Wednesday mornings, Nephrology on Wednesday mornings, the Hematology Clinic will be opened on the first and second Friday in the mornings, Dermatology on the first Tuesday of the month in the mornings, and the Rheumatology Clinic on the first Friday in the mornings. The Secretary said the public could call 660-4744 for further information.

            "text": " \u00a9 2021 PinkNews \u2981 All Rights Reserved (Facebook/David Alvord) Salt Lake County councilman David Alvord has apologised after he wrote on social media that the \u201cleft\u201d won\u2019t be happy until everyone is bisexual. Republican Alvord, who represents Salt Lake County\u2019s west side in the great District 2, claimed on Facebook that the \u201cleft\u201d wanted everyone to be bisexual, non-monogamous and miserable. According to local news channel KUTV, Alvord wrote the \u201cleft\u201d won\u2019t be happy until, among other things, \u201cwe each have light brown skin, exactly alike\u201d and \u201cuntil we are all bisexual and in non-committed relationships\u201d. He also said the left\u2019s goal was to reach a point where \u201cthere are no males, no females and we each have the same muscle mass, brains, talents and energy\u201d; \u201cwe have no children, and simply have new humans arrive in labs and immediately put into a school for collectivism and indoctrination\u201d; or \u201cuntil no one smiles more than another\u201d. David Alvord, former mayor of South Jordan, changed the post to private after he was contacted by The Salt Lake Tribune. He told The Tribune that the point of his post was to \u201csay that I see no easy end to the culture war\u201d. \u201cI think I could have been more diplomatic,\u201d he said in a text message. \u201cWhat I wanted to challenge is to really consider the endgame of the far-left. What mission is accomplished?\u201d He also noted Disney\u2019s firing of actress Gina Carano over her controversial social media posts that compared Republicans to Jews during the Holocaust. Alvord said Carano\u2019s message was that there \u201cshouldn\u2019t be thought police\u201d, which The Mandalorian star compared to Nazis, and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t say anything antisemitic\u201d. The Salt Lake Tribune also reported that David Alvord said he didn\u2019t \u201cthink biological males should compete against biological females in sports\u201d, alluding to recent efforts in Utah to ban trans girls from competing in school sports. He told\u00a0The Tribune: \u201cIt\u2019s probably actually dangerous. Someone could get killed. Another way of saying it is that I think the left is going too far.\u201d Late Wednesday (3 March) night, Alvord added a new public post to his Facebook page clarifying his comments. He wrote: \u201cThe \u2018left\u2019 I named in a previous post isn\u2019t any particular person, or even Democrats. \u201cThe left I refer to is Cancel Culture who is being too aggressive and who cancels Parler, Gina Carano, conservative books on Amazon, Girls sports, and today Dr [Seuss].\u201d David Alvord removed that post as well.

            "text": " When you make sixty thousand tons of toxic waste per day and you need to store it safely till the end of times, you do what the sun does to desert dwellers: you make a mirage. You fool people into believing that a solution is in sight. That\u2019s exactly what China\u2019s government does in Ecuador, by investing in the massive Mirador mining project. The\u00a0mega-mine\u00a0has estimated reserves of 5 million tons of copper, 700 tons of silver and 90 tons of gold. Digging it up leads to toxic waste than needs storage behind a dam. Toxic cascade Since 2007, experts say that present and proposed construction of dams to hold all the waste will inevitable collapse,\u00a0as it recently did in Brazil with 100s of deaths as a first consequence. In 2014, alternative plans were put forward and accepted by the Ecuadorian Government, but the risk remains extremely high. That is the opinion of Dr Steven Emerman, Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors of the World Mine Tailings Failure Database, who visited the site in November 2018. A dam failure would amount to more than 100 deaths, major loss of fish or wildlife habitat and extreme losses affecting critical infrastructure or services. Imagine a tsunami of toxic waste, hundreds of millions of metric tons, containing mercury, arsenic, cyanide, acid and heavy metals cascading through the steeply inclined river system to reach the Amazon River. This will be a veritable nightmare of pollution and destruction. The speed of the toxic cascade is impressive. If the collapse occurred at a moment of high rainfall\u00a0it would travel 88 kilometers in five hours. Dam disaster Ecuador\u2019s first open pit mega-mine happens to be located in a hotbed of biodiversity: the Cordillera del Condor. If the Chinese state companies succeed, it will become one of the largest mine\u2019s humanity has ever created. The companies involved are the Tongling Non-Ferrous Metals Group joined and the China Railway Construction Corporation. Dr Emerman noted that the first dam under construction was being built in a manner which did not comply with the Environmental Impact Study of 2014 and was being built at a \u201ccritical\u201d angle, in engineering terms at the \u201cedge of collapse\u201d. This dam will be 63 meters tall. The second dam in planning is to be 260 meters tall. The agreed plan is to build this dam with slopes which are steeper than generally used, thus creating a greater danger of collapse. There are many ways how a dam disaster can be triggered. The dams could collapse from overtopping in flood conditions. Neither of the dams take a Probable Maximum Flood into account. Nor do they consider the Probable Maximum Earthquake. The contents stored behind the 260-meter-tall dam will be \u201cwet\u201d by nature and therefore more susceptible to liquefaction. Building the foundations from what is known as \u201cweak material\u201d doesn\u2019t help either. Court case Three of us are bringing a case before the Ecuadorian courts. Our lawyer Julio Prieto will give the legal standing and details, Dr Emerman will provide scientific evidence and this author will represent Nature itself. The Ecuadorian Constitution is unique in giving rights for nature, meaning that anyone can go to court in the name of nature. We will use the precautionary principle in relation to grave threats to those constitutionally agreed Rights of Nature. We will ask for an injunction to halt the construction and to require a full review of the design and construction by an independent international panel of experts. These Author David Dene and Julio Prieto are United Nations\u2019 experts in harmony with nature. Julio Prieto is also an Ecuadorean lawyer who became famous for representing 30,000 Indigenous people in Ecuador impacted by Chevron\u2019s toxic oil waste and is also the author of a\u00a0book\u00a0about Rights of Nature for the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court. Dr Steven Emerman is the owner of Malach Consulting, the environmental compiler and vice-chair of the board of directors of the World Mine Tailings Failure Database and an expert on the Mirador Mine tailings facilities. More background on the\u00a0Mirador Mine\u00a0conflict in the Atlas of Environmental Justice\u00a0(Spanish). David Dene\u00a0is co-founder of\u00a0Protect Ecuador. 29th January, 2019 In order to bring the situation affecting the Mirador Mine into perspective I am including information on the recent Tailings Dam failure in Brazil.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Friday, January 25th.\u00a02019,\u00a0the\u00a042 year old\u00a0Brumadinho\u00a0Tailings\u00a0Dam in Brazil collapsed.\u00a0On\u00a0January\u00a030th.\u00a0\u00a0news outlets\u00a0declared that\u00a099\u00a0people had been found\u00a0dead, and the chances of finding\u00a0a\u00a0further\u00a0259\u00a0people missing were\u00a0declared\u00a0slim. Vale, one of the world\u2019s biggest mining companies,\u00a0has had $3bn frozen\u00a0from its accounts to pay\u00a0damages,\u00a0fines,\u00a0penalties and the\u00a0funding of\u00a0recovery\u00a0work.\u00a0Five arrests have been made.\u00a0 https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47054328\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0environmental damage will not only affect this generation. The killing of Nature by poisoning is like killing ourselves. Can we put a price on that.?\u00a0  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47021084\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ongoing list of damages and deaths attributed to this collapse puts the\u00a0Mirador Mine\u00a0situation into sharp focus, and once again obligates us to ask the question.\u00a0Can we afford to take these risks\u00a0with\u00a0our environment.?\u00a0 Facilities were given a Very High risk category in the 2007 consulting report by Knight-Piesold using criteria provided by the Guidelines of the Canadian Dam Association. The same criteria were used in the 2010 Environmental Impact Study, and again in 2011 in response to questions from the Ministry of the Environment.. Risk refers to the consequences of dam failure.\nThe mine should be designed to withstand the Maximum Credible Earthquake. I think it is important to clarify the definitions used in tailings dam design: MDE = Maximum design earthquake. This is the earthquake for which a dam has been designed\nMCE = Maximum credible earthquake that is theoretically possible at a particular location\nOBE = Operating Base Earthquake is an earthquake that will happen during the life of the project.\nPMF = Probable maximum flood The risk category derived from the consequence of failure relates to the population at risk, loss of life, the impact on environmental and cultural values, and the impact on infrastructure and economics. A category of \u201cvery high risk\u201d necessitates a very high standard of safety in construction and management. Cardno Consulting disregarded both the 2007 consulting report and the 2010 Environmental Impact Study. Both the risk factor, a combination of the probability of failure and the consequences of failure, had increased, and the consulting firm had disregarded both in favor of cost cutting. (Cardno EIS 2014) The Mirador Mine in Ecuador is a mega-mine, under construction in the Cordillera del Condor mountains. These tropical cloud forested mountains are registered by Conservation International as a planetary \u201chot spot\u201d of bio-diversity. The Cordillera del Condor mountains feed tributaries leading to the River Amazon. The Chinese company ECSA is building huge structures to hold hundreds of millions of tons of toxic mining waste known as tailings.\nTailings are waste materials, created in this case by the extraction of copper and gold from mined rocks. Tailings are highly toxic and need to be held in impoundments. Impoundments are called tailings storage facilities.\nAll Tailings facilities are supposed to be built to withstand earthquakes. Facilities are supposed to be built, to avoid internal collapse due to liquefaction of the contents and foundations.\nExcess water. Collapse can occur owing to excess water causing water overtopping the dam, or piping which occurs when tailings are washed through the dam walls.\nAll tailings facilities, all over the world, are supposed to hold toxic waste in perpetuity with no maintenance or inspections.\nDr. Steven Emerman has supported me in the writing of this article and has rigorously fact checked the content. If you would like to contact Dr. Emerman with any questions, his E mail address is shemerman@gmail.com\nDr. Steven Emerman is the owner of Malach Consulting, and is the environmental compiler and Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors of the World Mine Tailings Failure Database. His company specializes in groundwater and mining. He is the author of many reports on the Mirador Mine Tailings Facility.\nDr Emerman informs us that the following list comprises the five most common causes leading to the failure of tailings dams. He notes that the distinguishing feature of the Mirador Mine tailings facilities is that they are susceptible to failure by all of these listed causes.\nCollapse is inevitable. \u2981 Earthquake.\n\u2981 Flooding.\n\u2981 Internal erosion, also referred to as piping.\n\u2981 Static liquefaction.\n\u2981 Foundation failure. Here are some fundamental statistics sourced from ICOLD, the International Commission on Large Dams. ICOLD inform us that between 2006 and 2015 there were 18 tailings storage failures. Their prediction, Table 1,. for the period 2016 to 2025 is for 30 failures, showing a 67% increase.! For further and more detailed information you can access the World Mine Tailings Failure Database. https://worldminetailingsfailures.org/\nIt is worth noting that in contrast to water-retention dams, which are dismantled if they cannot be inspected and maintained, tailings dams are simply abandoned after mine closure under the assumption that they will hold back toxic mine tailings in perpetuity with no further maintenance and inspection, therefore, the utmost safety in construction is essential.  \u00a0 The Mirador Mine in Ecuador is being built with two huge waste dumps, (tailings storage facilities). The mine, when in full operation, is expected to produce 60,000 tons of mining waste tailings every day!\nThe foundations of the Mirador Mine are alluvial sediments.\nIn response to questions from the Ecuador Ministry of Environment in 2011, EcuaCorriente, quoted from the 2007 report by Knight-Piesol.\nThis report was originally written in English and was later translated into Spanish by Walsh Walsh Scientists and Engineers. This part in the original English refers to liquefaction caused by earthquakes.\n\u201cThe results indicate that the entire depth of the tailings deposit is potentially liquefiable for the MDE and OBE. Liquefaction is\nalso predicted for the loose alluvial soils near surface (in the upper 10 metres) for the MDE and OBE.\u201d Knight-Pi\u00e8sold, 2007. Rio Quimi Tailings Management Facility Feasibility Study for 27,000 tpd mine production [Estudio de viabilidad de la Instalaci\u00f3n de Gesti\u00f3n de Relaves R\u00edo Quimi para 27,000 tpd de producci\u00f3n minera]. Ref. No. VA201-78/09-2, 111 p. The dam could collapse by seismic liquefaction of the tailings without failure (or liquefaction) of the foundations. The report says that both factors are a potential for collapse; The combined, or separate potential realized would release hundreds of millions of tons of toxic waste into the sensitive and vital river systems of the Upper Amazon Basin.\nThe vision of the dam walls sliding into their foundations with millions of tons of toxic waste pouring over the collapsed walls is a nightmare that we do not want to experience.\nThe present plan increases tailings from 27,000 tons a day to 60,000 tons a day.\nThe torrent of toxic waste, millions of metric tons, would flow through the steeply inclined river system to reach a main tributary of the upper Amazon rainforest, the Santiago River, and from there it will continue its passage to the Amazon River. This will be a veritable nightmare of pollution.\nIn the case of a high rainfall event leading to collapse, the fastest-moving mine tailings would reach the next major confluence where the River Zamora meets the River Santiago, (about 88 km downstream from the Rio Quimi \u2013 Rio Zamora confluence), within 5 hours.!\nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/52d71403e4b06286127a1d48/t/564a18c0e4b0f19eae571949/1447696576435/Espanol-Emmerman-Mine-Tailing-Transport111515.pdf\nThe Tundayme dam. The Chinese are building what is projected to be the tallest tailings dam in the world. This dam, in the valley of the Tundayme River will be 260 meters high, and built with an inclination of 1 meter vertical to 1.5 meters horizontal. (Cardno EIS 2014) Cardno, 2014. Actualizaci\u00f3n del Estudio de Impacto y Plan de Manejo Ambiental, para la Fase de Beneficio de Minerales Met\u00e1licos (cobre), Ampliaci\u00f3n de 30 kt por d\u00eda a 60 kt por d\u00eda del Proyecto Minero Mirador, Concesi\u00f3n Minera \u201cMirador 1 (acumulada)\u201d: Informe a EcuaCorriente S.A., 1206 p. con 6 anexos (1125 p.). The Tundayme dam was not yet under construction when Dr Emerman visited the site on November 6th, 2018.\nThe dangers of building the tallest tailings dam in the world at a steep angle of slope are clear as stated in a quote I am taking from Dr Emerman:\n. \u201cA slope of 1V:2H is most common for tailings dams. This slope was stated in the EIS and all of the permits for the Mount Polley dam (although it was not followed in practice) and in the EIS for the Mirador dam (although it is not being followed in practice). That is, 1V:2H is generally regarded as providing a sufficient factor of safety for tailings dams.\u201d The Environmental Impact Study of 2010 had advised a slope of 1 meter vertical to 2 meters horizontal.\nThe consequences of the Tundayme collapse will be much greater than that experienced in other tailings dam failures simply because the dam is higher, the highest in the world, meaning that the released tailings will travel a greater distance at a greater speed.\nThe facility at Quimi, There are two facilities at the Mirador mine. This facility will incorporate walls at a height of 63 meters\nThe 2014 Cardno EIS said that the Quimi dam should be built at a slope of 1 meter vertical to 2 meters horizontal.\nDr Emerman in his visit to the facility on November 6th 2018 noted that the slope being built was 1 meter vertical to 1 meter horizontal, a slope angle referred to as a critical angle building on the edge of collapse.\nI quote from Dr Emerman\n\u201cAn embankment slope of 1V:1H is regarded as a critical maximum slope for the prevention of piping (also called internal erosion). This information can be found in presentations by consulting companies that design tailings dams and other earthen dams. A high slope (and the resulting high hydraulic gradient) forces water to move rapidly through the dam. This rapid movement washes tailings and other construction material out of the dam, which destroys the structural integrity of the dam. Failure of earthen dams by piping has resulted in more deaths than the failures of all civil engineering structures by all causes combined.\u201d\nThe dam is being built at a critical slope angle. This is building on the edge of collapse.\nCivil engineering structures are not supposed to be built at a critical state at the edge of failure.!\nWater-retention dams have stricter safety standards. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recommends an embankment angle of no steeper than 1 meter vertical to five meters horizontal for the prevention of piping.\nThe Quimi facility dam is supposed to hold back an excessively wet mass of tailings in perpetuity. The dam is being built in a manner where piping and collapse are inevitable.\nThe Mirador Mine facilities are being built in the tropical cloud forests of the Cordillera del Condor with a rainfall of 1.85 metric tons per square meter per year.\nThe risk category \u201cVery High\u201d was confirmed by ECSA in their 2011 responses to questions from the Ministry of the Environment.\nThis information was dropped from the Cardno 2014 EIS. Cardno consultants worked on a decision to build for a 500 year flood even though the risk had been increased owing to a doubling of tailings.\nFlood standards are not being met in the design of the Mirador Mine tailings facilities.\nWhen these standards are not met excess water can cause \u201covertopping\u201d which will cause catastrophic collapse.\nThe tailings storage facilities at the Mirador Mine are being built in violation of the Cardno 2014 EIS. The EIS states that the Quimi facility, now under construction, was to be built with a centerline construction with a 1 meter vertical to 2 meters horizontal slope. As I explained earlier, the Quimi facility is being built at a critical slope. on the edge of collapse.\nCollapse due to earthquake, flooding, internal erosion, static liquefaction, and foundation failure are all likely. In the next part of this article I am drawing your attention to examples of various dam collapses around the world and their resulting devastating environmental consequences. The Mishor Rotem Dam Collapse 2017\n https://lindsaynewlandbowker.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/tsunami-of-phophate-tailings-from-icl-plant-inundate-20km-of-dry-valley-near-dead-sea/ \u201cIsrael Chemicals first identified the spill at 11:45 a.m. on Friday (June 30, 2017), after workers found a hole in the eastern embankment\u201d. This a clear example of piping.  https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/toxic-tsunami-wastewater-gushes-over-10741676 You can see in the above picture the incredibly steep slope of the dam wall. The Mount Polley Collapse 2014  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZfCPNy9cPE\u00a0 \u00a0Independent panel review of Mount Polley TSF \u2013 Full presentation The above picture is of the Mount Polley collapse in 2014. This was caused by foundation collapse. The steep embankment and excess water were contributing factors leading to the most serious environmental disaster in Canadian history.\nThe mine waste travelled into Quesnel Lake, the deepest freshwater lake in the world, a depth of 1,400 meters. Livelihoods have been lost, fish stocks are decimated and both water and soil remain polluted from the catastrophe.\nThe Fundao collapse in 2015 occurred when the contents of the dam turned to liquid. The collapse was triggered by an earthquake measuring a mere 2.6 on the Richter scale. The dam had been suffering structural and drainage problems for several years prior to the collapse.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF3Clm6T_kI Investigating BHP\u2019s $5bn Mining Disaster In Brazil Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff described the event as \u201cthe worst environmental disaster Brazil has ever seen\u201d.\n19 people died and 6,000 people were displaced. 700 kilometers of river remain polluted, drinking water is polluted. The poison reached the Atlantic and fishermen on the coast are affected as well as the towns and villages and Indigenous peoples along the whole length of the river.\nThe Mount Polley Dam in British Columbia, the Fundao dam in Brazil, the Mishor Rotem Dam in Israel, and the recent Brumadinho Dam in Brazil, all collapsed for reasons that could have been avoided. The Chinese are building their waste dump holding facilities, (tailings storage facilities), in a manner which, if finalized under the present regime of construction, will destroy Ecuador\u2019s reputation as a world leader in environmental protection, and will create a catastrophe, in the Upper Amazon Basin never before seen or imagined. Both of the tailings storage facilities are being built in contravention of Environmental Impact Studies and pose an unacceptable risk for both the environment and for society.\nA disaster waiting to happen.? Yes, taking into account statistics and the above facts, it is inevitable.\nThere is clearly a need for legal action. \u00a0 Expert in Earth Jurisprudence \nUN \u201cHarmony with Nature\u201d. David Dene\u00a0is co-founder of\u00a0Protect Ecuador. 24th May, 2014 This article\u00a0is based on an original story in\u00a0EcoHustler. Also on\u00a0The Ecologist:\u00a0\u2018In Ecuador\u2019s Amazon, a small tribe lives under a dark, oily shadow\u2018. Ecuador is facing an unprecedented confrontation between a \u2018progressive\u2019 left-leaning government and a national coalition of indigenous peoples determined to stop vast oil and mining projects taking place on their community land and villages. Ecuador\u2019s umbrella organization representing the country\u2019s\u00a0Tribal Nations,\u00a0CONAIE, has declared a National Mobilization to oppose a wave of oil and mining projects that threaten tribal territories across the country. The declaration comes in the wake of increasing hostility by Ecuador\u2019s government against the indigenous people resisting large scale resource extraction on their ancenstral lands. The government has announced a \u2018national security alert\u2019. At present more than 200 Tribal National leaders are under investigation for terrorism \u2013 relating to the growing popular resistance to polluted water and\u00a0environmental destruction\u00a0arising from extractive industries. The government of the \u2018progressive\u2019 and\u00a0left-leaning President, Rafael Correa, is pushing hard for the development of oil and mineral resources as a means of bringing wealth to the country and raising much needed revenues for social spending. However its insistence on pursuing massive resource projects on lands owned by indigenous communities, and in some of the most biodiverse areas on Earth, is causing growing tension across the country. Oil Exploration and Extraction Yasuni National Park\u00a0is an area of incredible biodiversity which the Government has declared open to oil extraction. It is also home to indigenous communities including two groups living in voluntary isolation, the Tagaeri and Taromenane. However Yasuni is estimated to hold over 800 million barrels of oil worth some $18 billion, and its exploitation would yield Ecuador\u2019s government revenues of $7 billion. The decision to exploit Yasuni\u2019s oil has caused widespread outrage in the small Andean nation and 756,000 people signed an official petition demanding a referendum on whether the project should go ahead. To force a referendum 583,323 voters would have to sign, 5% of the electorate. However after a brief inspection of only four days, the government declared that only 359,762 of the 756,000 signatures were valid, claiming that the remainder were fakes and duplicates \u2013 and\u00a0refused to hold the demanded referendum. There are loud calls declaring the process\u00a0\u201cfraudulent\u201d\u00a0and a\u00a0failure of the Democratic process, and insistent demands that the electoral council publish the annulled signatures. \u201cThis is without precedent. This is fraud, a clear fraud. There is no precedent on a global scale\u201d, said Patricio Chavez, one of the petition organizers.\u00a0\u201cWe have a copy of everything we turned over and before turning it over we went through a verification process to prevent any problems.\u201d Sapara territory at risk Another Amazonian hotspot is the Sapara territory \u2013 380,000 hectares of forest under the official tenure of the Sapara Nation, now threatened with Chinese oil exploration. Leaders have held rallies and raised awareness of their danger. Several Sapara leaders are now facing investigation by the Attorney General\u2019s Office for terrorism and undermining the security of the country. Sapara leaders met this week to decide on future actions to save their forests. We are in communication with Gloria Ushigua, who is President of the Association of\u00a0Sapara Women, Ashinwaka. The Sarayaku, who won a Human Rights case in the International Courts have also pledged to defend their lands against oil exploration. We are in communication with\u00a0Jairo Santi, communicator for the\u00a0Sarayaku. The government has designated further oil concessions in Aschuar territory,\u00a0which the Aschuar People are resisting. The threat of huge mines Two areas in Ecuador threatened by large open pit copper and gold mines. The longest struggle is at\u00a0Intag\u00a0in the North West of the country. In recent weeks the military and police have invaded the territory and made arrests. The situation is tense and the people are determined to protect their territory. In the South East of the country in the province of Morona-Santiago, the Central Ecuadorian Government have launched major mining concessions which are\u00a0not acceptable to the Provincial Government\u00a0who are committed to preserving ecosystems and biodiversity. The situation is particularly tense in the area of\u00a0The Mirador Mine, an open pit copper and gold mine of\u00a0enormous scale. The destruction of water sources, endemic species, and cultural life have brought this mine to the first ever\u00a0Citizens Rights of Nature Ethics Tribunal. Corriente Resources About two weeks ago a church and school were\u00a0demolished in San Marcos\u00a0de\u00a0Tundayme in\u00a0Zamora-Chinchipe by EcuaCorriente S.A (ECSA), a subsidiary of Corriente Resources, which has a\u00a0troubled human rights history in the country. San Marcos is situated in an area to be submerged in toxic mine waste. The church was being used for Christian worship until it was destroyed. Last week workers locked themselves into the mine works citing\u00a0Human Rights abuses. This is a very difficult situation exacerbated by Government irregularities in relation to both Human Rights and The Rights of Nature, both of which are incorporated into the Ecuadorian Constitution. With growing spirit of rebellion across the country, the national mobilization of indigenous tribes, a National Security Alert in place, the disputed petition, and the government\u2019s continued commitment to seeking development by resource extraction, the tension in Ecuador is palpable. All indicators portray the picture of a country heading into crisis. David Dene\u00a0is co-founder of\u00a0Protect Ecuador. 29th April, 2014 This article\u00a0was originally published on\u00a0EcoHustler. See also:\u00a0\u2018Being Nature \u2013 extending civil rights to the natural world\u2018, by Mumta Ito. https://theecologist.org/2014/apr/29/ecuador-upholding-rights-nature Deep in Ecuador\u2019s Amazon rainforest, a gigantic open pit copper and gold mine is planned in the heart of the Shuar peoples\u2019 territory. David Dene tells the story of a growing international campaign to uphold and defend the \u2018Rights of Nature\u2019, in Ecuador and beyond. Over the last few months I have been asked on numerous occasions how I have come to be involved with an European Citizens Initiative to introduce a directive into the European Parliament on\u00a0The Rights of Nature. The answer involves an ancient medicine, a deep friendship with members of an Amazonian tribe, witnessing first hand the devastation caused by extractive industries and ultimately the insight that all of us can make a difference. My name is David Dene and I live in Andalusia, in Southern Spain (here is my blog). This is my story In 2001 I was invited to Amsterdam to partake in ceremonies using the plant medicine,\u00a0Ayahuaska, from the jungles of South America. This medicine has been used for millenia by the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon. I was so impressed that I invited the Shaman to come down to Andalusia. This was the start of this particular journey. Within a year, a Shaman, from the\u00a0Shuar tribe\u00a0of South Eastern Ecuador, came and introduced us to the Shuar Culture and their Ayahuaska Medicine, which they call Natem, or the Little Death, signifying death of the Ego. I was consequently invited to spend time with this Shaman in Ecuador, which, of course, I did. Over the years a strong friendship was built up with various Shamen from the area who came over to visit us here in Southern Spain. His Holiness The Dalai Llama took medicine in the jungle with these Shamen, so I felt that I was in good company. One day, the phone rang In 2012 I received a call for help from \u2018the family\u2019 as they were, and still are, threatened by a huge open pit copper and gold mine, set to mine 60,000 tons of ore per day. The Open pit mine, to be 800 meters deep, 4 kilometers wide and impacting over 200 water sources will have horrendous effects on the Shuar Culture and their ability to live and pursue their lives. This mine, financed by Chinese Government-owned mega-companies, has the potential to become one of the biggest mines on the Planet rivaling Bingham Mine at Kennecott in the USA. The area is of huge bio-diversity and contains endemic species. In other words, the mine is in direct contradiction to\u00a0the Rights of Nature enshrined in the Constitution of Ecuador. Poisoned waterways I decided that the best thing to do would be to visit the area and spend time with the Shuar and to visit NGOs working with them. I spent 2 months in a Shuar community in the jungle where I learnt of the conflicts and divisions running throughout the 70 Shuar communities in danger from the mining project. In Quito I was able to secure a map of the hydrology of the area submitted in the Environmental Impact document. Here in Andalusia we used PhotoShop and showed how poisoned waterways could affect the communities. These maps were circulated throughout the 70 communities and were also used by NGOs in Ecuador. We then created a website:\u00a0protectecuador.org\u00a0as a resource for all people wanting to know about the mine. Upholding the rights of nature? Our next action was to set up an\u00a0Avaaz\u00a0petition\u00a0calling on the judge, due to take the case presented to the Constitutional Court, to uphold The Rights of Nature. This case was dismissed, appealed, and lost on the grounds that mine was in the National Interest. We funnelled the Avaaz petition through The Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature and built friendship with the Global Alliance and with\u00a0Wild Law in Australia. I wrote an abstract for a Wild Law Conference and was invited to speak in Brisbane, Australia. Subsequent to that Conference I was invited to a Summit Conference of The Global Alliance held in Ecuador last January. At the end of the Conference we set up the first\u00a0Citizens Tribunal\u00a0to try cases which clearly abuse The Rights of Nature. The Mirador mine will be one of the first cases to be judged The Mirador Mine, in the Shuar territory was accepted as one of the cases to be judged, and at that time, in Quito, I was enrolled in an European Citizens Initiative. I am now working as co-ordinator in a working group (currently 40 people in 14 EU countries) who are\u00a0drafting a Directive\u00a0to propose to the European Commission, on the Rights of Nature. We aim to bring a European Citizens Initiative later this year Last Summer I visited Ecuador traveling with\u00a0Amazon Watch\u00a0on an advocacy tour to see the\u00a0damage caused by Chevron\u00a0in the North Eastern Ecuadorian Amazon. It is almost beyond belief. The \u2018Toxic Tour\u2019 is an apt description. We also visited the Sarayaku tribe, deep in the jungle, who won their case against the Government of Ecuador. The case was heard in the International Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica. For the first time in the history of the court the judges visited the accused Government and declared against the Government of Ecuador, citing Human Rights abuse. Even modest funding can go a long way \u2026 After leaving the Tour I visited tribal leaders in the South and at a meeting of the leaders they agreed that funding for regular monthly meetings would be a great help. The funding covers food, transport, communication, and the calling of reunions. We started this funding last July and out of those meetings we have formed a school to work with 50 young Shuar leaders, to re-invigorate the Shuar Culture, to re-integrate communities, to teach on Human Rights and Rights of Nature and how to defend these rights. We have been able to assist the Nations of Ecuador to meet and create resolutions heard in the General Assembly, (Parliament) of Ecuador. Work in progress is the creation of a film showing the potential damage likely from the mine and a short film on The Rights of Nature. Both films will be released in the next month or two. We will be fund raising for the school and for a Shuar village project to introduce people to the true Shuar Culture, their traditional houses, their knowledge of plants and all life, their medicines and their life style. You really can make a difference! I have written this to show how it really is possible to make a difference, how respect and confidence and trust can start to shift paradigms of thought, and create real change. This is both a critical, and a crucial time. Planet Earth\u2019s ecological systems are under threat. We are altering the fundamental patterns of relationship which have created the planet we live on. Our opportunity, indeed, our need, is to connect with others to take a stand for those fundamental relationships which we know as Nature. We are developing an Internet platform to enable connection. The European Citizens Initiative and The Mirador Mine are two of the emerging catalysts to enable us, Citizens of the World, to take a stand together. For me, this is a most rewarding and exciting adventure. I invite you to join in and to share the sense of joy, fun, and positivity embedded in all actions to empower Nature. By David Den 19 February, 2013\nCountercurrents.org There is an area in the Upper Amazon, in South Eastern Ecuador which is under threat from the first of what may be a succession of open pit copper mines. Mirador One has been licensed and more mines are planned for the future. This type of mining, \u201copen pit\u201d mining ALWAYS causes pollution because as soon as sulphide rocks are exposed to air and water, by chemical reaction, they exude sulfuric acid, which in turn releases heavy metals from the rocks, which in turn create toxic waterways. In this case the waterways link into the great Amazon River system. The acidification of the water causes gill malfunction in all fish life and ultimate death. The waters also become toxic due to the presence of heavy metals and toxins used to extract copper and gold from the mined ore. This acidification is known as Acid Mine Drainage and lasts for ever. The poisons remain in river sediment. Mines started in the times of the Romans are still leaching acid after 2,000 years. This acid moves into ground water, and in this case with a pit which will be started at 900 meters and which will be mined to a depth of 1,250 meters, putting the base of the pit below sea level, this is a certainty. The mine will process 60,000 tons of ore every day, crushing this ore and\nwashing it, using poisonous chemicals, and using an estimated 12 million liters of water per day. There are 227 water sources in the area, and with a pit that deep, of course, the delicate hydrology of the area which supports the diversity of life, will be irreparably damaged. It is certain that this used contaminated water will leach into the waterways, killing fish, and by bio-accumulation into the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom, will spread a slow cancerous death throughout the area. Rainfall is averaging at over two and a half tons of rain per square meter per year, so, there will be considerable run off of contaminated water. In the Environment Impact Assessment this project is considered as a High Risk project. Sacred springs and sacred lands will be rendered unusable, The Shuar will no longer be able to hunt and fish. Their Culture will be destroyed, and their lands polluted for eternity. This is a desecration of Nature. A case has been brought by eight NGO\u2019s and Human Rights Organizations confronting the Government by due process of law in relation to The Rights of Nature enshrined in the Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008. Early February this year, the first hearing was held in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, and the Minister for the Environment failed to appear, so the case was postponed. In 1997/8 the Shuar, who live near the mine, were trained by the Government to protect their borders against Peruvian incursions. I was at their General Assembly this year and they say that they will protect their land until their last breath. These men and women are \u201cwarriors\u201d. The worst scenario, which is unfortunately a possibility, is the militarization of the area and serious civil unrest. The President is relying on mining and oil exploration to continue his \u201csocial revolution\u201d, which is financed by the Chinese. At present Ecuador pays 24% of its Gross Domestic Product to service \u201clow interest\u201d Chinese loans, and it seems that access to more money hinges on China being able to strip Ecuador of it\u2019s most valuable mineral resources, which in turn strips Ecuador of the most ecologically\nmega-diverse areas left on the planet. This is a short term gain for one generation, followed by a terrible loss for all future generations. The legacy for the future will be an ongoing huge financial cost to mitigate the effects of Acid Mine Drainage in the upper Amazon, The fabric of Nature and the fabric of society will be devastated. All the money in the world cannot re-make and re-build a fragile eco-system, and a thousand year old culture destroyed by copper and gold mining. When this mine is stopped it has the potential to also stop the Ecuadorian Economy in it\u2019s tracks. The issue of the Mirador Mine goes beyond minerals and pollution. It is a pivotal point in the future of Ecuador, a direction where the Government and President will protect their Nature and \u201cGood Life\u201d for future generations, or a direction in which they will sell and destroy their Nature, leaving a legacy of severe environmental degradation and an ongoing financial burden to mitigate the effects of further damage from Acid Mine Drainage. In short the second option will destroy the elements of Nature and \u201cthe good life\u201d enshrined in their Constitution of 2008. When the Government uphold their Constitution they will not be able to follow their economic expansion. This is a pivotal situation. The question which the President has to face is indeed extremely difficult. Does he sell the Nature at the expense of future generations, or does he totally re-think and implement a new economic policy.? David Dene\u00a0is a researcher based in Spain. For further information see:\u00a0http://www.protectecuador.org Todo estaba bastante \u201cbien\u201d hasta el a\u00f1o pasado cuando los representantes de las empresas mineras transnacionales tuvieron una reuni\u00f3n con el presidente Correa y le persuadieron para relajar las leyes mineras de Ecuador. En pocas palabras, estas \u201creformas\u201d violan la Constituci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds y son una amenaza directa a los Derechos de la Naturaleza y los Derechos de las Naciones Ind\u00edgenas. La ley de \u201creforma\u201d establece claramente que la miner\u00eda puede desarrollarse en cualquier parte del pa\u00eds. Esto significa que las garant\u00edas que antes proteg\u00edan los derechos de la Naturaleza y los Derechos Humanos se han suprimido con eficacia. POR QU\u00c9? \u00bfEs porque a Ecuador se le ha prestado m\u00e1s de 17 mil millones de d\u00f3lares de los chinos y ha garantizado devolverlo a trav\u00e9s de ventas de productos b\u00e1sicos, en concreto 17 mil millones de d\u00f3lares en ventas de productos b\u00e1sicos? Despu\u00e9s de que los l\u00edderes de Per\u00fa y Ecuador se reunieron en Bomboiza, el presidente de la CONAIE, la Confederaci\u00f3n de Nacionalidades Ind\u00edgenas del Ecuador, Humberto Cholango, present\u00f3 una acci\u00f3n predeterminada en el Tribunal Constitucional el 09 de julio. Declar\u00f3 que, en marzo de 2010 se emiti\u00f3 un fallo constitucional que requiere la Asamblea Nacional de consultar a los Pueblos y Naciones Ind\u00edgenas antes de aprobar cualquier enmienda a la Ley de Miner\u00eda. Seguir leyendo la historia completa\u2026 All was reasonably \u201cwell\u201d until last year when\u00a0representatives of transnational mining companies had a meeting with President Correa\u00a0\u00a0and persuaded him to relax the mining laws of Ecuador. Put simply, these \u201creforms\u201d violate the country\u2019s constitution and are a direct threat to the Rights of Nature and the Rights of Indigenous Nations.\u00a0The \u201creformed\u201d law clearly states that mining can develop in any part of the country. This means that the safeguards that were previously in place to protect The Rights of Nature and Human Rights have been effectively abolished. WHY? Is it because Ecuador has borrowed more than 17 Billion Dollars from the Chinese and has guaranteed to pay the money back through commodity sales, 17 Billion Dollars worth of Commodity Sales? After the leaders from \u00a0Peru and Ecuador reunited in Bomboiza, the president of\u00a0\u00a0CONAIE, the\u00a0Confederation\u00a0of Indigenous Nationalities\u00a0of\u00a0Ecuador,\u00a0Humberto\u00a0Cholango, presented\u00a0a\u00a0default\u00a0action\u00a0in\u00a0the Constitutional Court on July 9th.\u00a0\u00a0He declared that in March 2010 a Constitutional ruling was issued requiring the National Assembly to consult with Indigenous Peoples and Nations before approving any amendments to the Mining Act.

The Moco Moco Hydro plant in Rupununi, Region Nine (Upper Takutu/Upper Essequibo) is expected to make a comeback after lying dormant for some 14 years. However, before works can begin on the facility, a detailed geotechnical investigation of the site is required.\nPublic Infrastructure Minister David Patterson said yesterday that the investigation will be crucial to the revival of the facility.\nThe Chinese-funded hydropower plant was commissioned on November 22, 1999 and was developed as a run-of-the-river project. Four years later, the penstock (a sluice for controlling or directing the flow of water) was damaged by a devastating landslide, in July 2003, resulting in a cessation of operations.\nDespite several attempts by the former administration, the People Progressive Party/Civic (PPP/C) it was never rectified. The facility has since been subject to vandalism.\nSteps were taken in 2015 by the new administration to have the plant, along with several others, up and running. In early 2016, the government had announced the rehabilitation of plant which in its current state, was estimated to cost $200M.\nFive foreign-based companies submitted bids for the rehabilitation and operation of the facility after the Public Infrastructure Ministry had asked for Expressions of Interest (EoI) in keeping with Government\u2019s plans to develop a \u2018Green Economy\u2019.\nThe EoI was initially published in January 2016 and the submissions were opened on March 31, 2016 at the Guyana Energy Agency (GEA) Head Office, Georgetown.\nAmong the five submissions were CHEA \u2013 Centrias Hidreletricas da Amazonia LTDA \u2013 ME (Brazil); NCGET (Russia); Torque \u2013 EPCM (Barbados) and two from McVantage Products out of the USA.\nPatterson said yesterday that the geotechnical survey will be funded from resources obtained from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).\nThe cost to resuscitate the plant, Patterson said, will be determined by the findings of the investigations.

            "text": " Welcome to The Tecma Group of Companies \nTecma Jobs\nSavings Estimate\n915-642-6228\n \nTecma Jobs\nSavings Estimate\n915-642-6228\n \nTecma Communications\nBlog\n0\n The leadership of the Chinese company BAIC are is to make a public announcement regarding a future capital investment of at least US $2 billion in the construction of its first manufacturing plant in Mexico. BAIC, the Beijing Automotive Industry Company, intends to initiate a manufacturing plant in Mexico shortly in order to avoid paying the twenty-one percent duty that is charged on product that is imported by Mexico at present. Presently, the company pays twenty-one percent in import taxes on the value of the contents of containers that it uses to ship pre-assembled modules. These modules are shipped to a facility in Veracruz at which final assembly of the vehicles is done. By setting up a full manufacturing plant in Mexico, the company will be able to sell its products in Mexico and in South America at a more competitive cost to the consumer. With the construction of the new manufacturing plant in Mexico, BAIC will integrate all of the several production processes of a car. This includes welding, painting, assembling and stamping. BAIC began marketing and selling its automobiles in Mexico in mid-2016 and has sold more than seventeen thousand units to date. Currently, BAIC International, which is a BAIC Group company is asking that Mexico\u2019s federal government exempt the firm from import duties for the time during which it is building its manufacturing plant in Mexico. The eight possible locations for the BAIC manufacturing plant in Mexico are Puebla, Sonora, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Quintana Roo, Hidalgo, Guanajuato, and Yucatan. Which entity has success in attracting the investment will have to do with several factors. Among them are local access to suppliers, logistics convenience, and incentives offered by the corresponding state governments. BAIC Group is an enterprise that is owned by the Chinese government and is the holding company of several automotive and machine manufacturers located in the capitol city of Beijing. Subsidiaries of the BAIC Group include BAW; a truck, bus and agricultural equipment maker, Foton Motor; and BAIC Motor; a military vehicle and SUV manufacturer. Additionally, BAIC also produced Hyundai and Mercedes branded vehicles for sale in the Chinese market through Beijing Benz and Beijing Hyundai. BAIC is the 4th or 5th leading domestic automaker in China. According to company spokesmen, the leadership of the Beijing Automotive Industry Company is presently putting the finishing touches on plans for its new Mexican production facility. Details about the plant and its capacity should become available by the end of the month of May. The building of the new manufacturing plant in Mexico will serve to strengthen the country\u2019s global position as a leading producer of light vehicles. Mexico is the world\u2019s eighth most prolific automobile manufacturer and is 4th globally in terms of product shipped overseas. Only Japan, Germany, and South Korea export more cars outside of their national boundaries. When it opens its first manufacturing plant in Mexico, the Beijing Automotive Industry Company will be joining other manufacturers such as Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Mazda, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai, Audi, Volkswagen others in having a location in the world\u2019s most rapidly growing automotive manufacturing market. With the growth in the presence of major automotive OEMs in the country, opportunities for suppliers to locate a manufacturing plant in Mexico abound. These manufacturers are invited to learn how the Tecma Group can help them to initiate and maintain a manufacturing presence in Mexico at greatly reduced risk and cost. \nBlog  \nBlog  \nBlog  Notifications"

Prime determinants of growth Supportive government regulations for usage of photovoltaic technology drive the global solar farm market. However, high cost associated with installation hinders the market growth. Contrarily, increase in demand for renewable energy presents new opportunities in the coming years.  Download Sample PDF (284 Pages PDF with Insights): https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/10607 Covid-19 Scenario The utility-scale segment to maintain its lead position throughout the forecast period Based on type, the utility-scale segment contributed to around half of the global solar farm market in 2019, and is expected to maintain its lead position throughout the forecast period. This is due to surge in investments in grid expansion and integration technologies such as storage and UV connectivity. However, the distributed generation segment is projected to witness the highest CAGR of 20.3% from 2020 to 2027.  Get detailed COVID-19 impact analysis on the Solar Farm Market: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-for-customization/10607?reqfor=covid The commercial segment to maintain its leadership status by 2027 Based on end-use industry, the commercial segment held the highest market share in 2019, accounting for around three-fifths of the global solar power plant market in 2019, and is expected to maintain its leadership status by 2027. Moreover, this segment is projected to portray the fastest CAGR of 20.3% from 2020 to 2027. This is due to increase in economies around the world, rise in urbanization, and adoption of solar energy by commercial buildings such as offices, malls, airports, and others to decrease the carbon footprint. The research also analyzes the industrial segment.  Asia-Pacific, followed by North America, to maintain its dominant position by 2027 Based on region, Asia-Pacific, followed by North America, accounted for the largest market share in 2019, contributing to more than two-thirds of the global solar farm market, and is expected to maintain its dominant position in terms of revenue by 2027. This is due to increase in government initiatives that raise the demand for PV energy and distribution of solar lighting systems in rural areas. However, Europe is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 21.1% from 2020 to 2027, owing to rise in production of solar energy, increase in construction activities that led to installation of BIPV systems to generate electricity, and implementation of stringent environmental regulations to reduce carbon emission.

            "text": " Invest in Lightspeed POS to take advantage of significant returns on meager investments through tax savings using DNSTC. Image source: Getty Images The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has introduced a new tax credit that is valid up to the 2024 income year. Taxpayers who have subscriptions to Canadian digital news media since 2019 and before 2025 can save up to $375 for the five income years. The Digital News Subscription Tax Credit (DNSTC) is a temporary and non-refundable 15% tax credit. DNSTC applies to amounts paid by taxpayers for eligible digital news subscriptions. The maximum tax credit you can claim per year is for a $500 amount, saving up to $75. That amounts to a total of $375 in five years. If you have been a digital news subscriber since 2019, do not miss out on this tax write-off as you prepare to file your tax return in 2021. The CRA considers eligible digital subscriptions as arrangements by taxpayers with a qualified Canadian journalism organization (QCJO) that lets them access news content digitally. Similarly, a QCJO primarily produces original written content. Any non-digital content or broadcasting organizations do not qualify for this tax credit. Any claimants must ensure that the media outfit has an existing QCJO status at the time they made their payments. Ask for an official receipt from the news outlet because it contains the QCJO designation number. The CRA requires all QCJOs to issue receipts that can verify subscribers when they claim the tax credit. If the subscription is a combination of newsprint and digital format, you can only claim the costs for the digital news. Taxpayers within a household can split the tax credit between them, provided that the long total claim is not more than what the CRA allows for an individual. You can claim DNSTC by applying the claim directly to Line 31350 of your income tax return. The idea behind the DNSTC is to give taxpayers a little financial incentive to support Canadian digital news media organizations. Between fiscal years 2020 and 2024, digital news subscriptions will help QCJOs achieve a semblance of financial stability in their business models. While the total tax savings might not be immense for you, there is a way for you to maximize the value of your tax savings through DNSTC. Investing even a meager amount in a high-growth stock like Lightspeed POS (TSX:LSPD)(NYSE:LSPD) and letting it grow over the years can turn that $375 into a much larger sum in the long run. Lightspeed is an ideal high-growth investment to consider due to its immense success since going public in 2019. The recent market pullback for the tech sector means that Lightspeed is down to a more affordable level. The company offers omnichannel commerce-enabling platforms to businesses. The company\u2019s growth has been remarkable despite the economic fallout from the pandemic. In the coming years, the market for cloud-based products is likely to expand further. Lightspeed\u2019s recent acquisitions have also expanded its geographic reach, increasing its potential for revenue growth in the coming years. Its current weakness could be an opportunity for you to buy the high-growth stock on the dip before it begins climbing again. Claiming the DNSTC is more about playing your part in helping the Canadian digital news industry than saving substantial amounts on your tax returns. But you can use the small savings through the DNSTC for substantial long-term gains, provided you invest the money in the right high-growth stocks. Lightspeed could be an ideal investment\u00a0for that purpose. Should you invest $1,000 in Lightspeed POS right now? Before you consider Lightspeed POS, you may want to hear this.  Motley Fool Canadian Chief Investment Advisor, Iain Butler, and his Stock Advisor Canada team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Lightspeed POS wasn't one of them.

BC Energy Investments Corp. and BP each hold 50% ownership of PAEG. PAEG is the largest private oil company in Argentina with activities from upstream to downstream. It's upstream interests are in Argentina's four main hydrocarbon basins, the Tarija basin in Bolivia, and in the shallow water Mexican area of the Gulf of Mexico. It also owns the Campana refinery approximately 75 kilometres north of Buenos Aires and more than 750 retail sites in Argentina, Uruquay and Paraguay. CNOOC International holds assets in both shale gas and conventional oil in Colombia and was one of the first companies to explore for shale gas in the country. In 2012, three gas wells were drilled on two of four blocks that CNOOC International holds close to Bogota. The four blocks occupy a total area of approximately 600,000 hectares, or 1.5 million acres. Over the last 20 years, CNOOC International has drilled seven conventional oil exploratory wells in Colombia. One of these wells resulted in an oil field that is operated by our partner Petrobras. CNOOC International has a 50% working interest. CNOOC International has 100% working interest in two deepwater exploration blocks \u2013 Block 1 and Block 4 \u2013 in the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s Cinur\u00f3n Plegado Perdido, located in the offshore segment of the Burgos geological province, containing mostly oil. In 2017, CNOOC International entered a 35-year licensing contract for the exploration and production of the block. The exploration period has been divided into three stages, for a total of ten years. Over the next few years, CNOOC International will complete the commitment of the voluntary workload in accordance with the requirements of the contract and will strive to obtain commercial discovery through drilling activities. CNOOC International holds 12.5% working interest in the 2C block and a 17.12% working interest in the 3A block in the Greater Angostura field, located in the eastern Trinidadian sector of the Eastern Venezuela basin.

Saying goodbye to loved ones and holding burial services and funerals are parts of a mourning process. However, many governments worldwide placed strict restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic over attending such occasions in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. Alami lost his father to a heart attack, yet it was impossible to give him a funeral or a condolences gathering since people are not allowed to meet in groups amid continuous increase in COVID-19 cases in Lebanon. Fadi Shams, owner of Ezzat Company which provides funeral services, told Xinhua that the people attending funerals and burial services dropped by 90 percent after COVID-19. \"Even if the deceased did not die from the coronavirus, you would only find a maximum of five people attending the funeral at the church,\" he said. Shams noted that prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, families of the deceased used to be picky in choosing the coffins and flowers to be placed in churches during funerals, but things have changed for now. \"Today, people ask for the cheapest coffins as funerals have become restricted to close family members, not to forget the dire economic conditions in the country,\" Shams said. Kamal Harb, who owns a company offering funeral services, told Xinhua that people used to serve visitors sandwiches during funerals and hire waiters to serve food in honor of the deceased. \"Funerals used to cost at least 1,300 U.S. dollars, however, the biggest funeral now only costs about 1.3 million Lebanese pounds (130 U.S. dollars),\" Harb said. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Lebanon, families of the deceased made death announcements on social media platforms by placing their phone numbers on scanned funeral papers for people who wish to offer their condolences. \"It's very sad to see our loved ones leaving this world while we are not able to feel the support of our close friends except virtually,\" Lama Obegi, who lost her older brother in a car accident two months ago, told Xinhua. \"The COVID-19 epidemic has changed one of our most important and valuable traditions,\" she added.

The interview with Oprah Winfrey was the couple\u2019s first since they stepped down from royal duties and the two-hour special included numerous revelations likely to reverberate on both sides of the Atlantic. Harry told Winfrey that he felt trapped by royal life and was surprised that he was cut off financially and lost his security last year. He also said he felt his family did not support Meghan, who acknowledged her naivete about royal life before marrying Harry, as she endured tabloid attacks and false stories. Meghan, who is biracial, described that when she was first pregnant with son Archie, there were \u201cconcerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he\u2019s born.\u201d The statement led Winfrey to ask \u201cWhat,\u201d incredulously and sit in silence for a moment. In a rare positive moment in the interview, Harry and Meghan revealed their second would be a girl. The interview opened with Winfrey gushing over Meghan\u2019s pregnancy and lamenting that COVID-19 protocols kept them from hugging. The interview was in the United States a full day before it will air in Britain. The revelations aren't over: Winfrey teased additional bits of the interview would be shown Monday morning on CBS. In response to a question from Winfrey, Harry said he wouldn\u2019t have left royal life if not for his wife, the actor formerly known as Meghan Markle who starred in the TV drama \u201cSuits.\u201d He said their relationship revealed the strictures of royal life. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to, because I myself was trapped,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a way out. \u201cI was trapped, but I didn\u2019t know I was trapped,\u201d Harry said, before adding, \u201cMy father and my brother, they are trapped.\u201d Harry acknowledged that he does not have a close relationship presently with his brother William, who is heir to the throne after their father, Prince Charles. Harry disputed rumors that he intentionally blindsided his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, with his decision to split. He suspects the rumors came from the institution. \u201cI\u2019ve never blindsided my grandmother,\u201d he said. \u201cI have too much respect for her.\u201d Meghan, too, was complimentary toward the queen, despite saying at one point she realized some in the palace were willing to lie to \u201cprotect other members of the family.\u201d \u201cThe queen has always been wonderful to me,\u201d Meghan said. Winfrey at various points in the interview ran through headlines about Meghan and at one point asked about the mental health impact. Meghan responded that she experienced suicidal thoughts and had sought help through the palace\u2019s human resources department, but was told there was nothing they could do. Meghan said she grew concerned about her son not having a royal title because it meant he wouldn't be provided security. Meghan said digesting everything during while pregnant was \u201cvery hard.\u201d More than the \u201cprince\u201d title, she was the most concerned about her son\u2019s safety and protection. \u201cHe needs to be safe,\u201d a teary-eyed Meghan recalled. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying don\u2019t make him a prince or princess, whatever it\u2019s going to be. But if you\u2019re saying the title is going to affect their protection, we haven\u2019t created this monster machine around us in terms of click bait and tabloid fodder. You\u2019ve allowed that to happen, which means our son needs to be safe.\u201d Meghan said it was hard for her to understand why there were concerns within the royal family about her son\u2019s skin color. She said it was hard for her to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d those conversations. Harry, too, said there are lasting impacts about Meghan's treatment and his relationship with his family. \u201cThere is a lot to work through there,\u201d Harry said about his relationship with his father. \u201cI feel really let down. He\u2019s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like. And Archie is his grandson. I will always love him, but there is a lot of hurt that has happened.\u201d Harry said the royal family cut him off financially at the start of 2020 after announcing plans to step back from his roles. But he was able to afford security for his family because of the money his mother, Princess Diana, left behind. Sunday's interview special opened with Meghan describing how naive she was about the ground rules of royal life before she married her husband, Harry, nearly three years ago. \u201cI didn\u2019t fully understand what the job was,\u201d she said. She also noted that she did not know how to curtsy before meeting Queen Elizabeth II for the first time, and didn't realize it would be necessary. \u201cI will say I went into it naively because I didn\u2019t grow up knowing much about the royal family,\u201d Meghan said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that was part of conversation at home. It wasn\u2019t something that we followed.\u201d Meghan said she and Harry were aligned during their courtship because of their \u201ccause-driven\u201d work. But she did not fully comprehend the pressure of being linked to the prestigious royal family. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to have an image of it that is so far from reality,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what was really tricky over those past few years, is when the perception and the reality are two very different things. And you\u2019re being judged on the perception, but you\u2019re living the reality of it. There\u2019s a complete misalignment and there\u2019s no way to explain that to people.\u201d The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018, and their son, Archie, was born a year later. At the top of the interview, Winfrey said no topic was off limits and that Meghan and Harry were not being paid for the special. Royal interviews that aren't tied to a specific topic are rare, and prior televised sessions have often proved problematic. Prince Andrew\u2019s 2019 BBC interview about his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein led to his own departure from royal duties after he failed to show empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims. Harry and Meghan\u2019s departure from royal duties began in March 2020 over what they described as the intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media toward the duchess. In Britain, the interview is seen as poorly timed. It will air while Harry\u2019s 99-year-old grandfather Prince Philip remains hospitalized in London after undergoing a heart procedure. It is unclear what public reaction, if any, the queen and other royal family members will have to Sunday\u2019s interview. The U.K.'s Sunday Times newspaper, citing an anonymous source, reported that the queen would not watch it. Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

The debt restructuring starting is also positive for us. Again they have only spoken to $500M worth of the debt so we need more info on the bigger picture here too \u2013 John A Barbadians in this forum and elsewhere have expressed deep concern about how successive governments have allowed the idyllic Paradise Beach location to rot. It is an unpardonable sin what we have permitted and it is time Barbadians wake up and demand accountability for managing our affairs.\u00a0 To rub salt in the wound Avinash Persaud and Prime Minister Mia Mottley played leading roles in what is popularly referred to as Four Seasons project. Shame! As if it is not enough for our leaders to demonstrate contempt for the electorate and continual misuse of public funds seen at Paradise Beach, the potential exist for the same to occur at another idyllic and historic location. In 2015 the former government negotiated concessionary financing to\u00a0 restore the historic Sam Lords Castle. It is useful to remind Barbadians that Sam Lord\u2019s Castle was built in 1820 and like Paradise and several other historic sites have been allowed to run to ruin. The most recent occurrence \u2013 deliberately destroyed by government with the blessing of the Barbados National Trust \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 an archeological find at Fort George. It is approaching 2 years since the former government broke ground at Sam Lord\u2019s Castle to mobilize a loan of $170 million from the Chinese Export-Import Bank. Sam Lord\u2019s when or if completed will be operated by hotel management company Wyndham\u00a0Hotels and Resorts. Another project with a similar feel is the hotel to be built next to the liquidated Liquidation Centre on Bay Street reported to be managed by Hyatt when completed. What is positive about the Hyatt project is that there is an individual driving about Barbados in a duty free gifted Mercedes associated with the project. Maybe, just maybe this project will be completed. It has been reported that the Chinese have vacated the Sam Lord\u2019s Castle property and like Paradise, Merricks and several other tourism projects scattered across the island have been left to rot. Will we ever learn? How will this government and others achieve objectives set to turn around the economy if projects cannot be brought to completion? This is where BLP, DLP and others will enter the debate to point fingers. Silly! This blogmaster joins with John A to ask the Mia Mottley government to update the nation on the status of the Sam Lord\u2019s Project. A followup question \u2013 has the default on debt affected this project? It is the right thing to do by a government preaching a message of being transparent.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The Other Side Of The Sam Lord\u2019s Castle\u00a0MatterSeptember 8, 2009 Top Brands \u2013 Sam Lord\u2019s Castle and\u00a0SandalsJuly 3, 2014 Remove This RH Sign \u2013 Chinese Sign Greets Visitors to Sam Lord\u2019s Castle in\u00a0BarbadosNovember 5, 2017 Wuhloss\u2026can\u2019t even blame me for that one\u2026ah said what i knew\u2026and STILL\u2026.silence.

Was it the air or seaport, China\u2019s favourite means of exercising its modern-day colonial-type control of these hand-to-mouth countries which pretend to be punching above their weight? But MAM need not worry too much.\nHer administration can always draw on the massive grant sitting in some offshore account which China \u2018donated\u2019 to Barbados under the Stuart administration to build a Performing Arts Centre at Brandons just off the Mighty Grynner Highway. The lies that politicians tell sometimes live after their demission or forced removal from office but the damage they cause always remains as tombstones to their immorality. LikeLike  This article is dated February 2019 and quotes Stuart Layne a respected civil servant? \u2018Late 2020 opening\u2019 for Sam Lord\u2019s hotel Article by\nEmmanuel Joseph Published on\nFebruary 19, 2019 The redevelopment of Sam Lord\u2019s Castle into a hotel carrying the Wyndham brand is expected to be ready for business toward the end of 2020, almost a year behind schedule, Parliament was told today. But Government funding for the project has been cut from the initial $30 million, according to the 2019/2020 Estimates. The hotel resort was scheduled to be completed this winter, but Chief Executive Officer of the Barbados Tourism Investment Inc, Stuart Layne, revealed today that there are two major obstacles in completing one of the blocks of close to 200 rooms. Layne, who did not elaborate, told this to the newly-established standing finance committee of the House of Assembly. He is among the first technocrats to appear alongside ministers to answer questions from lawmakers under revised rules of the lower chamber for the annual appropriations debate. Minister of Tourism and International Transport Kerrie Symmonds had asked Layne to update the House on the Sam Lord\u2019s project in response to a request from Opposition Leader Bishop Joseph Atherley. Stuart said: \u201cThe project itself is 450-room hotel to five-diamond specifications. It is a Wyndham brand. In other words, the Wyndham brand would be responsible for managing the property.\u201d He said the funding was provided by Government in its Estimates through a $170 million loan from the Bank of China. But the BTII chief executive noted that the estimated cost of the overall project is $200 million with Government to provide counterpart funding. In response to the Opposition Leader\u2019s other request to know the amount of money owed to landowners whose properties were compulsorily acquired by Government to facilitate the project, Layne could not give a figure. Layne told the House: \u201cIn relation to the issue of land, yes, there is an outstanding amount. The land was compulsorily acquired by the Government and there is a balance which I don\u2019t have with me since it is calculated daily; but there is some outstanding balance still to be paid on the land.\u201d But this answer did not satisfy the Opposition Leader. During her time asking questions, Minister of Economic Affairs and Investment Marsha Caddle revealed that the capital spending of $30 million in the Estimates was to be slashed by almost half. She said Government was willing to have a \u201cmarginal contribution\u201d in some projects in order to prove to investors they were viable. \u201cThe $30 million that is seen here as allocated to Sam Lords Castle, which is to be officially reduced in these Estimates to $18 million, and the reason it is to be reduced to $18 million is because of this Government\u2019s intention to sell it on as been reference earlier,\u201d said Caddle, who indicated that Government was keen on being more of a facilitator. She told fellow lawmakers that so far US$42 million has been drawn down from the Exim Bank of China \u201cwith another US$9 million pending\u201d. LikeLike  Wuh Loss.

It runs on both sides of the Lookout/Turtle Crawl point, meaning above and below. Last time I went and looked, a few squatters had established themselves in ramshackle huts on the below side, which is a great beach.\nAnd it appeared the construction was extending up to the property limits on the Cave Bay side of the property. I would \u201cguess\u201d there has to be 800ft of waterfrontage or more. Nor was it using any of the area in the old \u201ccastle\u201d, or at least construction did not currently extend into that area.

It was +/-1988, and there was a building boom. I often wondered what these people would do, were it not for the oil. The revenue from which went into a few pockets. Since then I have wondered likewise in several places. The Barbados natural resource is its climate. A great many places survive on Tourism of one kind or another. It is not something to be ashamed of. Yes it is nice to have ancillary forms of revenue, but making small of tourism doesn\u2019t develop alternates.

It the 450 rooms are vertical, the foundation of the hotel needs to be seriously good. Nowadays there are technologies that show up the voids and no engineer is going to take chances. My guess is the foundation will burst the budget before many of the 450 rooms can be built!! Remember the VAT building in Warrens?

Guyana with the boom they have ahead can easily find the foreign exchange to buy Scotias operation there.

I don\u2019t think alot of people understand the power and wealth Guyana will be in control of shortly. As for Barbados I doubt the IMF would entertain our government buying Scotia.  I like you see it going to Republic which I support 100 percent. LikeLike  @ David. Even if the Nation come with a story it will be short on important facts.

However, he warned that there was still a lot of work to be done. \u201cPeople are expecting things to happen overnight but you cannot correct systemic problems overnight. These things take time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to transform how we do business. Certainly the ease of doing business is a general target of the Social Partnership to try and improve in that area wherever we can, to pick the low-hanging fruit and fix them quickly, but there are some systemic issues that have to be addressed and the Prime Minister and the Government have set certain targets and we are working with them to try and achieve these targets,\u201d said Clarke. He said one of those targets was getting public sector employees to adapt to new technology to make doing business in Barbados easier. \u201cIn Barbados we have a lot of methods and processes of doing things because it was done so for the last 25 years, and we need to move away from that and try to look at improving how we do business. I think the Government has started to do that, rightfully so, and we are going to work with them to try and achieve the targets that are being set,\u201d he said. The BPSA head said while the transformation targets set by Government under the Barbados Economic Recovery and Transformation programme were \u201cvery aggressive\u201d, he was pleased that several committees have been established to help in the process. \u201cSo wherever the private sector can help we are going to work with Government and the labour unions to resolve the issues,\u201d said Clarke. marlonmadden@barbadostoday.bb LikeLike  David\nOctober 19, 2019 5:34 PM The Chinese lent to restore Sam Lords and it was done with Chines labour, Connect the dots.

We see these places as gas stations. It is a mistake to think of them in terms of being countries. For example, less than 10 percent of the people living there are Qataris. The fanciful building boom is still progressing with haste but a country such does not make. In Barbados, we have an industry, tourism, which increasingly depends on the state, this was always so. How could it be possible to predicate our existence on such a tenuous structure? Now, if it was a real industry supporting other industries we would agree with you but the country imports virtually everything used by these same tourists. Tourism spawns the budget deficits and the debt which is driving the austerity. And we could go on and on. If Barbados were a corporation you would not buy shares in it. But as investor you will buy stock in tourism because goverment gives concessions and alters the market to satisfy elite forces. BTW Qatar sits on the second or third largest LNG in the world. Yes, we should be ashamed that from capital formation to what is on the plate the visitors eat from comes from somewhere else. And this is after 70 years of this form of antidevelopment.

They can be fixed/improved.\nThe tax changes present a host of opportunities in removing credits/write offs available.\nAnd given how the debt rose vs tourist arrivals, it is hard (inaccurate?) to blame tourism for all of our consumer spending woes on imported items.\nI know of two farmers whose primary market is hotels and restaurants. The secondary is direct to consumers. It is only their tertiary choice which ends up in the local food chain. They have modified what they produce to meet primary customer needs. And neither is hurting. They also work.\nImport substitution has long been the focus the island should adopt.\nIt isn\u2019t Tourism\u2019s fault, the supply chain works the way it does?

            "text": " Former Vice President Mike Pence is planning his first speech since leaving office earlier this year. Pence will keynote a dinner hosted by the Palmetto Family Council - a conservative Christian nonprofit group - in South Carolina next month, an aide told The Associated Press over the weekend. Load Error Since vacating the vice presidency in January, Pence has been doing work with the conservative Heritage Foundation and Young America's Foundation. He has not made any indications regarding plans to run for future public office. Pence, who has not spoken publicly since he and former President Trump left office, published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal earlier this month criticizing the 2020 election and attacking H.R. 1, a voting rights bill that passed the House last month. \"While legislators in many states have begun work on election reform to restore public confidence in state elections, unfortunately, congressional Democrats have chosen to sweep those valid concerns and reforms aside and to push forward a brazen attempt to nationalize elections in blatant disregard of the U.S. Constitution,\" Pence wrote in the Journal, arguing the bill would \"trample the First Amendment, further erode confidence in our elections, and forever dilute the votes of legally qualified eligible voters.\" Pence was criticized by Trump's supporters, hundreds of whom stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, for not standing in the way of the certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory as the vice president presided over a joint session of Congress. During his final days in office, Trump repeatedly pressured Pence to \"do the right thing\" and \"come through\" for him and his supporters. Trump was later impeached in the House on an article of inciting insurrection against the government. He was later acquitted in his Senate trial. Before the trial, Pence wrote a separate Journal op-ed encouraging Democrats to reject the impeachment charge, drawing comparisons to President Andrew Johnson's impeachment. \"But at the close of the trial on May 16, 1868, he stayed true to his convictions, opposed the passions of his own party, and voted to acquit Johnson. He faced social ostracism and physical assault. Still, he knew he was right,\" Pence said in the piece published on Jan. 16. \"The question naturally arises: Who, among the Senate Democrats, will stand up to the passions of their party this time? Who will stand up against 'legislative mob rule' and for the rule of law? Who will be the 2020 Profile in Courage?\" South Carolina is a pivotal early presidential primary state with a victory providing momentum for any candidate with hopes of earning the Republican or Democratic nomination.

More info Raya and the Last Dragon is an animated film from the Walt Disney Animation Studios, starring Kelly Marie Tran and Awkwafina in the title roles. The new animation has already gained a great deal of popularity among fans but is currently only available to stream as a Premier Access download. As a result, many fans may be waiting for the moment the movie arrives on the platform for free.  Unfortunately for fans, there is quite a wait for this moment to arrive. While Raya and the Last Dragon came out on March 3 on Disney+, it was made a Premier Access download, meaning fans would have to fork out \u00a319.99 to watch the movie. The film will be released as a free download on the platform, but fans will have to wait until June 4 to do so.  READ MORE:\u00a0 Elvis Presley divorce: Why did Elvis and Priscilla split?         The official synopsis reads: \u201cWalt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Raya and the Last Dragon travels to the fantasy world of Kumandra, where humans and dragons lived together in harmony long ago. \u201cBut when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. \u201cNow, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it\u2019s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people.      \u201cHowever, along her journey, she\u2019ll learn that it\u2019ll take more than a dragon to save the world\u2014it\u2019s going to take trust and teamwork as well.\u201d Kelly Marie Tran, of Star Wars fame, lends her voice to Raya while Awkwafina is Sisu, the dragon of the title. Gemma Chan, Benedict Wong and Alan Tudyk have supporting voice roles. So far, critics have been big fans of the movie, with it gaining a 95 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.       Simran Hans of The Observer gave the film four stars, saying: \u201cThere is an incandescence and a buoyancy to the animation that elevates the formula.\u201d Andy Lea of the Daily Express added in his four-star review: \u201cThe sparky characters, slick animation and breezy (and entirely bloodless) fight scenes transport us to a beautifully realised fantasy realm.\u201d The Times\u2019 Kevin Maher, who gave the film a full five stars, added: \u201cYou will watch the last 30 minutes of the movie on the verge of tears.\u201d Some reviews, mainly in non-UK publications, gave the film more middling reviews, stating the narrative of the film felt a little bit cliched.  David Fear of Rolling Stone said in his three-and-a-half star review: \u201cWhat we have here is really a by-the-book hero's journey-but it's the interplay between the warrior and the wiseacre that makes a stock storyline snap, crackle and pop.\u201d Similarly, The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s Sandra Hall said in her review of the same mark: \u201cThe tone is a lot lighter than in Mulan or Frozen and the design has great ingenuity, as well as being remarkably beautiful. It's fun but predictable.\u201d While the reviews are a mixed bag, generally the film has been a big success and has already gained many fans despite the hefty price tag. Raya and the Last Dragon is free on Disney+ from June 4, but is available to stream via Premier Access now   See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive."

            "text": " By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2013     U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday will order a review of changes the previous administration made to on rules on how colleges should handle sexual assault allegations and formally establish a White House Gender Policy Council, officials said. A Biden executive order he will sign later on Monday will direct the U.S. Education Department to review all its existing regulations, orders, guidance, and \u201cpolicies for consistency with the administration\u2019s policy to guarantee education free from sexual violence,\u201d according to a White House fact sheet provided Sunday night. In 2017, the Trump administration reversed Obama-era guidelines that had spelled out measures schools should follow to try to prevent sexual assaults on campuses. Trump\u2019s Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, argued the Obama guidelines resulted in too many students being falsely charged and the accused being treated unfairly. In May 2020, DeVos unveiled final regulations on how colleges should deal with sexual misconduct allegations on campuses. She said the rules would require \u201cschools to act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process.\u201d Biden\u2019s order directs a review of the 2020 regulation \u201cto determine whether the regulation and agency action are consistent with the policies of the Biden-Harris Administration,\u201d the fact sheet said. A second executive order will formally establish a White House council gender equality council, officials said. The council is part of \u201ca government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls in the United States and around the world,\u201d according to a White House fact sheet. Jennifer Klein, chief strategy and policy officer at anti-sexual harassment activist group Time\u2019s Up, is cochairing the council with Julissa Reynoso, a lawyer who previously served as a diplomat and deputy assistant secretary of state during the Obama administration. As a candidate, Biden pledged to narrow the wage gap between men and women, invest in women-owned businesses and fight against work-place discrimination. His vice president, Kamala Harris, is the first woman to occupy the position. The council will work with other parts of the administration to address \u201cbarriers to women\u2019s participation in the labor force, decreasing wage and wealth gaps, and addressing the caregiving needs of American families and supporting care workers,\u201d the fact sheet said. As of January, women accounted for slightly more than half of the 10 million jobs lost during the coronavirus crisis, even though they typically make up a little less than half the work force. More than 2.5 million women left the labor force between February 2020 and January of this year, compared to 1.8 million men. Biden will direct the council to submit a \u201cgovernment-wide strategy to address gender in policies, programs and budgets\u201d and an annual report on progress, the White House said.

            "text": " LONDON (Reuters) \u2013     Millions of English children and teenagers headed back to school on Monday for the first time in two months, having endured their second extended stretch of home learning because of a strict national lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19. The reopening of English schools to all pupils is the first step in a four-stage government plan to ease the lockdown while trying to prevent a new surge in infections after a devastating winter wave that severely strained hospitals. Since the start of the pandemic, Britain has recorded 124,500 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test, the fifth highest official death toll in the world and the worst in Europe. For adults in England, the lockdown remains in force, with social contact severely restricted, people under orders to stay at home except for essential reasons, most shops closed, and cafes and restaurants able to offer only takeaway or delivery. \u201cGetting all schools back has been our priority and the first step of our roadmap back to normality,\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter. The reopening of schools is a huge relief to millions of parents who have spent months juggling work and full-time childcare. Primary school pupils return to their classrooms and playgrounds with some COVID rules, such as not being able to socialise with children outside a strictly defined \u201cbubble\u201d, staggered arrivals and departures, and frequent hand-washing. For secondary schools and their pupils, the requirements are more onerous. Teenagers are being mass-tested for COVID \u2014 a logistical headache for schools \u2014 and are required to wear face coverings in class. Despite these restrictions, the near-consensus among parents, teachers, child psychologists, social workers and broader society is that getting children back into schools is urgent for their mental health, education and life chances. Most pupils had missed out on more than three months of school in the spring and early summer of 2020, when Britain was under its first strict national COVID lockdown. In that first shutdown, as in the recent one, only children considered vulnerable or those whose parents are classified as \u201ckey workers\u201d by the government were allowed to go to school. However, even they were not having normal lessons, as teachers were busy organising distance learning for all the others. \n  (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon, editing by Ed Osmond) Subscribe Sign up for our daily news explosion."

            "text": " Rurrenabaque\u00a0and San Buenaventura, parted by the\u00a0Rio Ben\u00ed\u00a0 For the people living in this region...their interdependence with the natural environment would make the dams a socio-ecological disaster. The decades-old developmental fantasy of using Bolivia\u2019s rapid altitude change from the Andes to the Amazon to generate electricity is about to be tested in reality. Two proposed dams -\u00a0Chepete and El Bala -\u00a0are set to form the centre of the government\u2019s dream to make Bolivia 'The Energy Heart of South America'.\u00a0 Located on the Rio Ben\u00ed north of La Paz, the dams would be the largest infrastructure projects in the country\u2019s history, with total costs approaching $6billion to $8billion.  Critical ecosystem The project was declared a national priority in 2007 and\u00a0construction starts next year with the aim to have Chepete and El Bala in operation by 2025 and 2030, respectively. In 2014, the government commissioned a feasibility study by Geodata, an Italian engineering firm. Both the process and the findings of the study have exposed many of the significant problems underlying the projects.\u00a0 The government tried to stifle publication of the Geodata study while commissioning another by the same company. In the meantime, they have persisted with plans to begin construction in 2019.\u00a0 Bolivian (and international) law guarantees indigenous groups an open, prior consultation, conducted in good faith, when a project is proposed in their territory. But locals described various instances of corrupt and conniving visits by government officials. For the people living in this region...their interdependence with the natural environment would make the dams a socio-ecological disaster. \u00c7hepete and El Bala would sever the waterway intersecting Madidi National Park and Pilon Lajas Biosphere Reserve, which together constitute one of the most biodiverse and well-preserved stretches of Amazon rainforest.  Socio-ecological disaster Their construction would inundate 771 km\u00b2 of rainforest, an expanse five times greater than the La Paz urban area. The dams would have all of the wider effects typical of hydroelectric development (interruption of sediment flows and nutrient cycles, disruption of fish migration, elevated mercury content) in one of the most critical ecosystems on earth.\u00a0 For the people living in this region, this is not an exclusively environmental issue:\u00a0their interdependence with the natural environment would make the dams a socio-ecological disaster.  Most directly, the inundations would displace over 4,000 people from the Moset\u00e9n, Leco Tacana, and San Jose de Uchupiamona groups \u2013 with no clear plan for their resettlement and no compensation for the disappearance of thousands of years of cultural patrimony. A similar fate will befall those not directly inundated by the reservoirs, as the ecological destruction will deprive both local indigenous nations and the downstream towns of Rurrenabaque and San Buenaventura of their livelihoods.  Since the 1990s, the region has depended on a thriving eco-tourism industry. This sector, which respects the local environment and cultural heritage while providing sustainable incomes, would be crippled by the dams\u2019 impacts. Higher price The area is geologically unstable, suggesting a possibility of dam failure caused by landslides or intense rainfall. Recent disasters in Colombia and Laos show just how easily this can unfold, especially in light of increasingly severe weather events due to climate change. Perhaps most remarkably, though, the project does not\u00a0appear to be economically viable.  Even the most favorable price estimate (55 USD/mgwhr) exceeds the current market price of energy in Brazil (52 USD/mgwhr), the supposed export market for electricity.  Significantly, these estimates consider neither the cost for the transmission line necessary to transport the electricity, nor the likely price decrease induced by Brazil\u2019s domestic development of energy alternatives. Executive power President Evo Morales presents himself as an anti-capitalist advocate for indigenous rights and environmental protection.  Some people in the region have\u00a0said that Evo\u2019s administration began with honest intentions to support a radical leftist transition, while others have suggested that the rhetoric was only a ruse to gain office.\u00a0 All agreed that a systematic disregard for these values has been borne out of a desire to build, maintain, and consolidate executive power. After nationalizing hydrocarbon resources early in his Presidency, Morales used this income to develop and expand social programs aimed at reducing poverty and improving the standard of living.  But as Morales\u2019 popularity began to rely on these social investments, his dependence on the extractive industries that fund them has also deepened.\u00a0 Appeasing supporters Fracking in Tarija,\u00a0lithium mining in Salar de Uyuni, and, most of all, the\u00a0TIPNIS highway\u00a0are all designed to appease Morales\u2019 supporters and augment government bank accounts. And they have all created a wide spectrum of ecological conflicts and resistances. With hydrocarbon reserves being depleted more rapidly than expected, Morales is turning to hydropower dams like Chepete and El Bala to maintain the income needed for social investments.  But rather than being the key to a sustainable and just future, Chepete and El Bala appear only to be the next step in a line of contradictory, exploitative, and authoritarian projects which disregard the interests and people Morales purports to represent in favor of those on which his power depends. Fortunately, there is a vast network of selfless and determined people fighting against this potentially great social and environmental injustice. Their resistance is now the most crucial part of the story.\u00a0 Activism and resistance La mancomunidad de las comunidades (commonwealth of communities) was founded to represent the indigenous groups who will be most affected by the dams. They have been the focal point for resistance and communications while representing interests abroad to raise awareness and build capacity.\u00a0 La Coordinadora para la Defensa de la Amazonia\u00a0(Coordinator for the Defense of the Amazon), was formed by a conjunction of indigenous peoples living in the protected areas and local citizens in Rurrenabaque and San Buenaventura. They play a key role in providing supplies, finances, and organizational support. In the urban centers of La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz, larger networks of activists spread the message of the planned injustice amongst a wider and more detached populace.  Most significant among these are Fundaci\u00f3n Sol\u00f3n and CEDIB. They have played a central role in disseminating information via several media to raise awareness about the injustices and incongruities inherent to current plans for Chepete and El Bala and speaking truth to power more directly in La Paz. Great works There\u2019s a large sign standing outside the two-story, house-like airport building in Rurrenabaque. The right third is a picture of Morales in full presidential regalia, with the rest of the board announcing the details of an airport renovation project taking place this year.  Under the facts, figures, and timeframe it says, \u201cCon grandes obras cambiamos la historia\u201d: with great works we change history. The activists, scholars, and leaders whom I had the humbling privilege of interviewing are some of the most dedicated, selfless, and inspiring people I have ever had the honor to know.  I was thinking of them as I left Rurrenabaque and once more saw Evo smiling on the sign.\u00a0Con grandes obras cambiamos la historia.\u00a0But with them in mind, I would suggest a different line:\u00a0Con grandes resistencias cambiamos el futuro.\u00a0 With great resistances we change the future.

Sinohydro, which continues its international push following recently announced awards in Israel, Pakistan and Uganda, amongst others, now has 1,050 days to complete its work. Contracts for Ivirizu\u2018s tunnels will be awarded by the energy ministry soon, with awards for the plant\u2019s transmission components to be offered straight from Ende Transmision. Ivirizu is being developed by Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (Ende) subsidiary Electrica Valle Hermoso, which has previously stated it expects the project to be on line in 20201. The Bolivian government said it was making the $520 million project\u2019s completion a priority in June 2016, with the goal of making Bolivia an exporter of surplus energy. The country has a number of other hydropower plants also in development, meaning about 70% of the country\u2019s power will come from hydroelectric sources by 2025. HydroWorld.com reported in April 2016 that Ende had awarded a contract to complete design studies for\u00a0the 347-MW Carrizal plant.

Xu Cheng, assistant\u00a0deputy\u00a0manager\u00a0in the corporate\u00a0department at project lender ICBC Per\u00fa, says it took two years to close the deal. \u00a0 The consortium would have been unlikely to obtain financing from local banks given Odebrecht\u2019s damaged reputation in the country, says a lawyer with knowledge of the deal. \u00a0 In theory, the eventual debt financing should have been more expensive as some international banks refused to participate, hence less liquidity and a potentially higher price. However, in practice the Chinese consortium found enough liquidity at a \u201clow price\u201d since, according to law 30737, the assets are\u00a0declared clean from any potential corrupt act by Odebrecht, says a bank executive close to the deal. \u00a0 \u00a0 The deal was partly financed through a USD 850m two-year bridge loan and letter of credit facility from Bank of China (Luxembourg branch), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (Luxembourg branch) and BBVA Banco Continental. \u00a0 The Bank of New York Mellon acted as offshore collateral agent, Scotiabank Per\u00fa as onshore agent and trustee, and ICBC Per\u00fa as debt and equity\u00a0escrow\u00a0agent. Even finding a local collateral agent and trustee took around six to eight months because of Odebrecht\u2019s image problem in the country, say people close to the deal. \u00a0 The bridge loan expires in 2021, after which the Chinese consortium may look to refinance the\u00a0debt, possibly through the issuance of bank debt or project bonds, according to the same banker, adding that the rationale was to pursue a more simple acquisition bridge, \u201crather than to embark on a more complex permanent financing solution in the context of a very complex M&A transaction\u201d. \u00a0 The Export\u2013Import Bank of China\u00a0looked at the deal initially, but since the borrower is a Peruvian SPV, they could not participate due to internal regulations, says a project finance executive close to the deal. \u00a0 Peru\u2019s banking regulator \u2013 the SBS \u2013 authorized Bank of China to start operations in Peru in January, pending certain conditions, paving the way for Chaglla to become its first major financing in the country. \u00a0 \u201cIt makes sense for [Bank of China] to put their foot in the door with a massive transaction like this one,\u201d the lawyer says. \u00a0 ICBC on the other hand has had an office in Peru since 2012. \u201cWe\u00a0know\u00a0Chinese\u00a0companies\u00a0better,\u00a0so\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0bigger\u00a0chance\u00a0we\u00a0can\u00a0support Chinese investors\u00a0in Peru\u2019s\u00a0energy\u00a0sector,\u201d says Cheng at the bank. \u00a0 But the fact that the buyer and lenders were mostly Chinese did create some challenges for the non-Chinese bank\u00a0in the deal. \u00a0 \u201cThe challenge is that, being all Chinese and therefore somehow related and potentially aligned, decision-making clauses needed a lot of work for [the non-Chinese] to avoid being left out of the process,\u201d says a person with knowledge of the deal. \u00a0 The remainder of the USD 1.39bn valuation was provided in equity by the Chinese consortium. \u00a0 \u00a0 Despite the current low prices in the Peruvian energy market, Empresa de Generaci\u00f3n Huallaga\u2019s revenue is assured through 2031 thanks to a 15-year PPA signed with state-owned Electroper\u00fa in 2011, which took effect in 2016. The PPA tender, in which only new hydroelectric projects could participate, fixed the energy price under a take-or-pay arrangement. \u00a0 \u201cPeru is one of the Latin American countries that provides long-term growth potential with a relatively well-developed and stable legal regime and an open view toward foreign investment,\u201d says Sergio Galvis, a lawyer at NYC-based firm Sullivan & Cromwell that advised the buyers. \u00a0 The PPA provides Chaglla\u2019s main income and the price \u2014 around USD 54 per MW/h during peak hours\u00a0plus a capacity payment \u2014 was considerably higher than the regulated price of around USD 40 per MW/h at the time of the auction, says Rene Vergara, head of Peruvian energy holding Ampato Energia, which owns the SPV Sulpay Energ\u00eda that operates a 1,400MW thermoelectric plant in Peru.\u00a0 \u00a0 As a result of the hydro PPA tender, and the start of operations of several new hydroelectric projects, including Chaglla, there is an oversupply of power in the Peruvian energy market which has forced the spot price down in recent years. \u00a0 \u201cThe actual crisis of low prices in the market is due to the existence of these [hydro] plants, which means the energy bought by Electroper\u00fa ends up being almost given away on the spot market,\u201d Vergara says. \u00a0 The government\u2019s decision to tender power supplies exclusively for new hydroelectric projects \u2014 in theory, due to the fact that the maximum capacity of the Camisea natural gas pipeline in Peru, which transports gas from the country\u2019s Amazonian region to the coast, had been reached \u2014 effectively \u201ckidnapped\u201d some of the demand, and artificially pushed up the prices of the PPAs, says Vergara. \u00a0 After the Chaglla contract expires in 2031, the Chinese consortium will need to develop a new commercial offtake strategy. The spot market price is unlikely to fall below USD 40/MW given the projected increase in demand, mainly from new mining projects, say people spoken to for this article.\u00a0 \u00a0 Chaglla\u2019s location \u2014 in northern Peru\u2019s Andean region \u2014 makes it an important power supplier for Peru's mining industry, which is expected to see strong investment growth in the coming years. Peru\u2019s Economy Minister Carlos Oliva recently said that Peru\u2019s portfolio of mining projects under construction, mainly copper mines, now totals some USD 9bn. \u00a0 This includes Chinese-owned projects. \u00a0 In middle of last year, Beijing-headquartered Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco), which has been operating in Peru for over a decade, started work on the USD 1.3bn expansion of its Toromocho copper mine in central Peru\u2019s Jun\u00edn region \u2014 some 200km from Chaglla \u2014 with plans to double its annual copper output to 300,000 metric tons. \u00a0 Other mining projects in Peru have been postponed due to social opposition from local communities. \u00a0 In the energy sector, Peru lags behind other countries\u00a0in Latin America such as Chile in terms of renewable energy investment, and recent political turmoil \u2014 in part caused by the Odebrecht scandal \u2014 has not helped to define new policy for the sector. \u00a0 \u201cFrom 2022 there will be an energy crisis in Peru due to lack of installed capacity and demand growth\u2026 we will go from an oversupply situation to an energy deficit abruptly,\u201d says Vergara. \u00a0 Given Chaglla\u2019s PPA with Electroper\u00fa, its new owners will hope to remain unaffected. Increasing energy prices and demand for power from mining projects could even attract further Chinese investment in Peru\u2019s energy sector. \u00a0 Read more All content \u00a9 Mergermarket Limited  2021 (03879547 UK)."

Trying to persuade her country to do the same proved tricky. Three hundred years ago, in 1721, England was in the grips of a smallpox epidemic. \"There were people dying all over the place,\" says Isobel Grundy, a professor emeritus of English at the University of Alberta in Canada. \"Social life came to a standstill \u2014 and all the things we've suddenly become familiar with again.\" But as Londoners cowered inside their homes, there was a woman who knew how to end the outbreak. Her name was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and she had learned a technique from women in the distant Ottoman Empire that could stop the pox in its tracks. What happened next is a tale of politics and public health that bears some \"depressingly similar\" parallels to the current pandemic, Grundy says. But it also shows how science and determination turned the tide against one of the worst diseases humanity has ever endured. Smallpox was far deadlier than the coronavirus the world is currently battling. Fatality rates were as high as 30%, and many of the dead were children. Those who survived were often left scarred by the disease, which covered the body in blisters. But in the 1700s in the Ottoman Empire, centered around modern day Turkey, some women knew how to stop it. These women were part of a vast informal network of female medical professionals. \"There were a lot of women practitioners in the Ottoman Empire,\" says Akif Yerlioglu, a historian of Ottoman medicine at the University of Oslo in Norway. They were not allowed into the madrassas, Ottoman universities, but they shared knowledge among themselves, working as faith healers, midwives, surgeons and, even in one case Yerlioglu says, an eye doctor. What these women knew was this: Take a bit of pus from a smallpox patient and use a needle to scratch a tiny amount just beneath the skin so it gets into the blood of a healthy person. That person would get a mild form of smallpox and become immune to the more serious version. Yerlioglu says the practice is strikingly absent from Ottoman medical texts written by men, but accounts that do survive make clear that it was a well-known practice. \"Women were sharing this knowledge, this know-how, among themselves,\" he says. The technique was known as engrafting, variolation or, simply, inoculation. It is thought to have originated in China centuries earlier, and it was also practiced in India and Africa. \"We don't know exactly why or how it works, we just know that it does work,\" says Michael Kinch, an associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis who has written a book on vaccination. Kinch and others suspect this form of inoculation may have worked because it introduced the smallpox virus through the skin, rather than the lungs. \"By putting it in the place that is less deadly, i.e., the skin, then you would have a greater likelihood of surviving,\" he says. Another theory is that the inoculators were using a less dangerous strain of the virus. \n                For centuries, smallpox killed and disfigured its victims.\n                \n                \n\n                    The National Library of Medicine\n                    \n\nhide caption\n For centuries, smallpox killed and disfigured its victims. This kind of inoculation did have risks. A relatively small number of people could become very sick and even die, and patients could give others smallpox. But it was far less dangerous than catching it through normal routes. European doctors were aware of what the Ottomans and others were doing but they refused to believe it worked. At the time, \"Europe was pretty isolated and it was fairly xenophobic,\" Kinch says. Grundy says reluctance to adopt the practice was about prejudice, not science. \"It comes from an Islamic country that we regard as backwards \u2014 'How could they have the answer to smallpox?' \u2014 and also it was something done by women, which is bad.\" This was where things stood when Lady Mary arrived in the Ottoman Empire's capital of Constantinople in 1717. Lady Mary was a wealthy noblewoman, married to the English ambassador to the empire. She was enthralled by the thriving metropolis. \"The art was completely different, the customs of life were completely different, the music, everything really,\" says Grundy, who has devoted much of her career to studying Lady Mary's writings. \"So it was all very exciting to her, and among the new discoveries she took in was this practice of inoculating against smallpox.\" Lady Mary described what she saw in a letter home to a friend. She told how old women kept pus from a smallpox victim in a nutshell and used a needle to create a tiny scratch in their patient's vein. She was instantly convinced of its potential. \"I am well satisfied of the safety of this experiment, since I intend to try it on my dear little son,\" she wrote. Lady Mary was ready to inoculate her son because smallpox had killed her brother a few years earlier, and shortly before traveling East, she had contracted it herself. \"She did survive but she was very, very badly marked. Her eyelashes never grew back after the smallpox and her skin was very much scarred,\" Grundy says. She had her son inoculated in Constantinople. The family traveled back to England. And then, in 1721, came the major smallpox outbreak in London. Lady Mary quickly arranged to have her daughter (also named Mary) inoculated. And as a member of the aristocracy, Lady Mary's decision got noticed. It was written about in the papers. \"By the time spots came up on little Mary, there was kind of a queue at the door to come and see her,\" Grundy says. \"Both social acquaintances of Lady Mary and of high-placed doctors.\" Lady Mary embraced the attention. In her letter of 1717, she had written of her desire to spread the practice of inoculation: \"I am patriot enough to take the pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in England.\" But in the next breath, she expressed contempt for British doctors, who she believed were too preoccupied with making money: \"I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly about it, if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their revenue, for the good of mankind.\" \n                Within a few decades of Lady Mary's introduction of inoculation against smallpox using live virus, Edward Jenner developed a far safer technique known as vaccination.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Within a few decades of Lady Mary's introduction of inoculation against smallpox using live virus, Edward Jenner developed a far safer technique known as vaccination. Rather than turn to the male medical establishment, Lady Mary sought to persuade the future queen of England, Caroline, the Princess of Wales, to inoculate her children. The princess, an ally of Lady Mary's, was willing to give it a try. After consulting with physicians and the king, the decision was made to conduct a series of tests \"taking criminals condemned to death and asking them to volunteer to be inoculated experimentally,\" Grundy says. Six condemned criminals were offered pardons in exchange for participating in the experiment. It was \"by today's standards, wildly unethical,\" says Kinch. There were additional tests on orphans. These kinds of experiments were commonplace for medical professionals of the time \u2014 it was medicine as practiced in a society with a rigid class structure, where slavery was still legal. \"I think there was a different view of people's lives, and of the value of life and all lives being equal,\" he says. In the end, the Princess of Wales did inoculate her daughters (her sons, possible heirs to the throne, were considered too important to risk), and Lady Mary became a public figure, which came with consequences. The princess's decision made inoculation \"a political matter,\" says Grundy. \"Those who opposed the royal family would say, 'Oh, well this is something the Princess of Wales is doing, I wouldn't trust that.' \" There were others who mistrusted its Islamic origins and some who just resisted the idea of putting a foreign contaminant in their body. For Grundy, the cultural divisions Lady Mary encountered feel very familiar. She sees parallels in today's political fights over whether to wear masks, or the racially charged conspiracy theories claiming the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab. \"The repetition of the way in which battle lines get drawn, that's really extraordinary,\" Grundy says. Kinch says Lady Mary's actions also offer lessons. \"One takeaway for everyone, whether it be scientists or nonscientists, is that we're not nearly as smart as we think we are,\" he says. \"We have much we can learn from others.\" Lady Mary wanted to stop smallpox, and to do it she was open to all ideas, he says. \"Her brilliance and her open-mindedness helped her to embrace something that helped her to save hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives.\" That's because the technique she'd borrowed from Ottoman women did take hold in England. Many thousands were inoculated, including a young boy named Edward Jenner. He went on to develop the first vaccine, also against smallpox. Vaccines proved to be safer and more effective than the old ways of inoculation. Smallpox was declared completely eradicated in 1980. And vaccination is still being used today to fight new deadly viruses, including the coronavirus. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor"

            "text": " ronstik - stock.adobe.com Care homes in Cumbria and Nottinghamshire are piloting a diagnostic telemedicine system that allows doctors to undertake virtual care home rounds. The Teki-Hub system was developed by GPs and is being trialled by the Pathfinders specialist and complex care centre for physical health needs in Nottinghamshire and Kirksanton care home in Cumbria. The telemedicine equipment includes a no-touch infrared thermometer, digital stethoscope, otoscope and tongue depressor attachments. The system uses Wi-Fi, mobile or satellite networks to connect to GP surgeries, community services or hospitals, so clinicians can use video to direct care home staff to administer tests. The video consultation platform, part of the system, allows clinicians to communicate with patients. Trudy Harrison, MP for Copeland, Cumbria, said: \u201cI am delighted that some care home residents in my constituency will be among the first to benefit from remote diagnostics consultations with their GPs. \u201cTools such as Teki-Hub have the potential not only to reduce infection risk during the pandemic, but also to help deliver care to more patients more quickly and it is great to see more organisations trialling these innovations.\u201d The system was originally developed by two GPs to provide GP care in remote communities, but is now also being used to avoid risks of exposure during the Covid-19 pandemic. The system is already in use in 18 care homes across England and Scotland and is being trialled in care homes in Staffordshire, Coventry, Wolverhampton and London. GP Graham Crippin from Colne Valley Practice in Kirklees has been using the Teki-Hub system for virtual ward rounds and ad-hoc acute assessment since October 2020. \u201cExamination remains a vital part of the clinical assessment of a patient and, in the current pandemic, Tekihealth Solutions provides the tools to make a remote consultation as similar to a face-to-face consultation as is possible,\u201d he said.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Alexandra Valencia 3 Min Read QUITO (Reuters) - Chinese mining consortium Ecuagoldmining has initiated a dispute with Ecuador\u2019s government over a gold mining project that has been halted by objections from community activists, a move that could lead to a $480 million arbitration fight, an Ecuadorean official said in an interview on Tuesday. Ecuagoldmining\u2019s Rio Blanco mine in southern Ecuador had barely kicked off production in 2018 when the activists, mostly comprising local farmers, demanded they be consulted on whether the mine should be allowed, and won a court order halting operations. Deputy Mining Minister Enrique Gallegos-Anda said it was the first such dispute since Ecuador began a broad push to expand its mining sector, which has drawn investor interest but also faces concerns about the power of local groups to halt projects. \u201cThe international dispute was presented in January,\u201d Gallegos-Anda told Reuters. \u201cThe ministry needs to officially receive the invitation for talks. We are going to have a dialogue and will seek a solution.\u201d The six-month process is the first step in a potential arbitration as laid out in an investment treaty between Ecuador and China, Gallegos-Anda said. He added that Ecuador\u2019s government hopes that a constitutional court ruling would allow the project to resume operations, avoiding an arbitration proceeding. \u201cThe logical thing to do is wait for the magistrates of the court to conclude that the judges incorrectly interpreted the norms,\u201d said Gallegos-Anda. \u201cShortly thereafter, the company could resume activities.\u201d If it does go to arbitration, the Ecuagoldmining will seek the full value of the gold that it expected to produce during the 11-year concession, he said, adding that he did not know which arbitration panel would hear the dispute. Ecuagoldmining, a consortium made up of Chinese firms Junefield Mineral Resources Limited and Hunan Gold Group, declined to comment. Community opposition to oil and mining projects has become a growing issue in Latin America, with local organizations in Peru and Colombia frequently demanding greater environmental protection and more jobs for those who live in the region. Ecuador\u2019s constitutional court last year ruled against requests for popular referendums on mining projects involving Australia\u2019s SolGold PLC and Canada\u2019s INV Metals Inc.

Equatorial Guinea saw the loss of at least 20 lives and over 600 wounded following a series of explosions at a military base in the city of Bata.   No one is more resilient than the citizens of Bata and the people of Equatorial Guinea and, I am confident they will beat this The explosion which occurred around 4 pm on Sunday caused severe damage to numerous houses and buildings in Bata. In an official statement, President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo said the detonation was \u201ccaused by the negligence of the unit in charge of storing explosives, dynamite and ammunition at the Nkoa Ntoma military camp.\u201d Furthermore, he explained that, \u201cThese caught fire due to stubble-burning by farmers in their fields which ultimately made these depots explode in succession.\u201d  The head of state appealed to the international community for aid and acknowledged the vastness of the impact the explosions will have on the country\u2019s economy - which has already suffered a major hit with the pandemic and drop in oil prices as an oil-reliant country.  \u201cWe are shocked by this tragedy and pain. We should not dwell on the past or get stuck in grief,\" stated NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber. \u201cNo one is more resilient than the citizens of Bata and the people of Equatorial Guinea and, I am confident they will beat this. As a business community, we need to focus on supporting the government in its building efforts. It has to be rebuilt not as it had been, but this is an opportunity to build Bata as it should be,\u201d concluded Ayuk.  In the aftermath of this tragic event, we urge the oil and gas community to mobilize their expertise, capabilities, and community resources to assist with the relief and recovery efforts in coordination with the government. \nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.\n Energy Sector stands with Equatorial Guinea as explosions decimate in residential areas Get freeAfrica-related contentOn your website, on your mobile, to your e-mail inbox...

I was a bit shocked.\"Suicidal thoughtsMarkle said she had suicidal thoughts, which were \"very scary.\"\"I just didn't want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought,\" she said, adding she asked for help within the institution but was denied.\"I remember this conversation like it was yesterday, because they said, my heart goes out to you because I see how bad it is, but there's nothing we can do to protect you because you're not a paid employee of the institution,\" she said.\"This wasn't a choice. This was emails and begging for help, saying very specifically I am concerned for my mental welfare,\" she added.The couple also revealed the gender of their second baby in the interview.They have a daughter in the \"summertime,\" said Prince Harry.The latest member of the Royal Family will be the fifth grandchild of Charles, the Prince of Wales, and either the 10th or 11th great-grandchild of the Queen and her husband Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh.Should Harry and Meghan's baby be born in California, the current residence of the two royals, she will be the first member of the House of Windsor to be born in the US.In Jan. 2020, the royal couple officially stepped back from their senior positions in the royal family and no longer use their official titles of His/Her Royal Highness (HRH), which are usually given to senior members of the House of Windsor.The decision was a result of intense media scrutiny of the couple by British tabloids who were accused of bullying and intruding in the personal lives of the royals. It is understood that Buckingham Palace was disappointed with the decision and was not even consulted beforehand.In September 2019, Meghan sued Associated Newspapers after their affiliates, the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online, published a private letter she had written to her estranged father and sought damages for alleged misuse of private information, copyright and infringement, as well as a breach of the Data Protection Act. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bEarlier this year, she won a high court privacy case against the Mail on Sunday after a two-year legal battle. -\n                                                         "

            "text": " Ana\u00efs Marin spoke about the preparation of her new annual report on the events in Belarus. Ana\u00efs Marin, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Belarus, announced the start of preparing a report on this topic, which will reflect the events in Belarus in 2021. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Marin explained how the work on the document will proceed, and how one can now influence the attitude of the Belarusian authorities to the observance of human rights in the country. - How does your work on the report on human rights in Belarus look like? - I am preparing the annual report for the UN Human Rights Council in accordance with the resolution adopted by the council. To do this, we collect and study the data we have received from various sources and double-check it. Such sources may include the government of Belarus, diplomatic missions in Minsk, which clearly know what is happening in the country, international organizations, as well as Belarusian civil society structures and human rights defenders. We constantly receive reports and information from various human rights organizations. We announced publicly this year that we welcome input from all stakeholders for our new report. And now, I receive some statements, evidence of human rights violations in Belarus and testimonies from the victims of repression themselves almost every day. Among other things, there is also video evidence. - You say \u201cwe\u201d. How many people are preparing the report with you? - Unfortunately, very few. We do not have enough resources, and there is a lot of work. I am constantly engaged in making the report - on a voluntary basis, as an expert, without receiving a salary for this. According to the UN HRC resolution, another person was supposed to work in Geneva, but he is very busy participating in the preparation of the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which will soon be presented. There is another intern and volunteers who help me double-check the information and write this report. They also don't get paid. - How will this report differ from the two previous ones authored by you? - The report to the HRC will focus specifically on human rights violations in 2021. In this case, I must say, there is no room for any innovations. A report to the UN General Assembly is different. This is a thematic report, and here I am more free to choose aspects, which I would like to emphasize. The report for the council is a kind of panorama, but this year I decided to pay special attention to the situation in the field of education in Belarus. I believe it\u2019s important to highlight the problems that exist now and have been there before - cases of reprisals against students for political reasons, against school principals who lost their jobs after they were honestly counting the votes in the elections. All these things are interconnected. And they demonstrate how much the right to freedom of expression is being violated in the country. - The authorities in Minsk do not recognize your mandate, do not want to cooperate with you, and you are not allowed into the country. When was the last time you were in Belarus, and does such ignorance on the part of the authorities hinder the preparation of the report? - The last time I was in Minsk was in the autumn of 2018. The authorities keep on pretending that my mandate does not exist. I love Belarus very much. I have friends there. And, of course, to work on the report, it would be very useful to come to the country, visit, for example, prisons, meet different people, including government officials. Because in fact, the first addressee of my recommendations is the Belarusian authorities. It is a pity that they do not want to cooperate with me, because otherwise they could have provided me with official information about what they are really doing to protect human rights in the country. Until now, they have not taken advantage of this opportunity. - Why make reports if the official Minsk does not notice either such documents or their authors? - I think they do notice. I believe that with my work I interfere with the authorities quite strongly. In the UN Security Council and in the Human Rights Council, not only I spoke, but also the assistant to the High Commissioner. In addition, many international experts on this topic took part in various meetings. And in response, we have repeatedly seen discontent not only from Belarus, but also from other countries, which also believe that human rights are only their internal affair. I am an independent expert, not a diplomat or a UN representative. Such reports are just one of the tools. We send letters to the authorities so that they clarify the situation in this or that case, give guarantees that, for example, a person who is now behind bars has access to a lawyer, and so on. Human rights defenders thank us, saying that after sending our letters, supported by thematic special rapporteurs (on torture, freedom of assembly, media, and so on), after our intervention, the situation of such persons improved. In addition, it seems to me that there is also a pedagogical dimension in these letters - we constantly remind them of international human rights standards. We remind the authorities that there are international conventions that Belarus has signed and ratified, and their requirements must be complied with. - Your report for the past year, as well as in the statements of many human rights defenders, speak of an unprecedented level of violence in Belarus after the presidential elections. You said that your report is only one of the tools. What other tools can be used to influence the Belarusian authorities in order to improve the situation with human rights in the country? - You probably know that 17 OSCE member states have launched the so-called Moscow Mechanism to study the situation in Belarus. Authoritative OSCE expert, Austrian professor Wolfgang Benedek was chosen as the speaker (he was a speaker in the framework of the Moscow Mechanism on Human Rights Violations in Chechnya in 2018 - edit.). In November 2020, his report was published, which recorded all violations that occurred before, during and after the presidential elections in Belarus, and recommendations were made not only for the government of the country, but also for all OSCE member states. Now only their political will can help improve the situation. I also hope that prosecutors in other countries, within the framework of universal jurisdiction, will open criminal cases against those Belarusian security officials who, after the elections, committed such serious crimes as torture. We have evidence, a lot of evidence about this. And the victims have the right to fair justice, which, unfortunately, is now impossible in Belarus itself. My mandate as a special rapporteur has certain limitations; I cannot in any way participate in the consideration of such cases. But when victims of repression turn to me, I have to tell them something. My last hope is that these people have the right to have their cases investigated precisely abroad. Of course, those who violated the law, used torture, remain in Belarus so far. However, the proceedings within the framework of universal jurisdiction will at least show that the attention of the international community to the situation in Belarus has not gone anywhere. \u00a9 1998\u20132021 \u0425\u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b\u044f\u201997 www.charter97.org\n\nRemember, please, you are expected to refer to the Charter'97 Press Center when using the site materials.The publisher: Charter97.org in Warsaw: charter97@gmail.com\n ISSN 2543-4969\n"

The General Administration of Customs of China stated that these farms \u201chave excellent fruit fly monitoring procedures, use raw materials registered with ICA, strictly comply with the chemical withdrawal period, and the products can be traced from planting to export\u201d. Colombian Minister of Agriculture, Rodolfo Zea Navarro said: \u201cWe are very pleased to pass this news to Hass avocado producers and exporters. This is the result of the government\u2019s promotion of 'health diplomacy' and their support for agricultural development. The authorization of new production and processing entities will continue to promote the growth of avocado exports because the Chinese market has huge consumption potential.\" ICA general manager Deyanira Barrero Le\u00f3n emphasized the work of Colombia\u2019s animal and plant quarantine system. Thanks to strict compliance with international market requirements, Hass avocados from this country won the trust of the Chinese market and gained market access last year. \u201cThe Chinese market with its expansive market outlook is our focus. Therefore, we work in teams to provide them - from small farms to large processing plants - with more opportunities,\u201d he said.

He said the project was moving forward to direct negotiations and reiterated this was the first time Chinese direct equity investment was being made available outside of China with China Harbour Engineering having 30 per cent equity in the facility. He was responding to a question in the Senate on Tuesday from Independent Senator Amrita Deonarine who asked about projects for fence line communities to cushion the impact of the termination of 5,000 jobs at state oil company Petrotrin. Khan said a number of projects benefiting fence line communities are already in train and others were about to be embarked on. He said the projects for the West, South and Southwestern peninsula communities include: San Fernando/Point Fortin Highway which is already in train and construction is being accelerated in 2019; La Brea dry docking facility and the National Infrastructure Development Company and China Harbour Engineering Company have executed a cooperation agreement for the development over a three year period at a cost of US $500 million and construction activity will include deep water channel excavation, offshore reclamation and terminal land construction; Construction of the jacket by Trinidad Offshore Fabricators Company Limited of bpTT Cassia field development platform \u201cand we are pleased to announce we have brought back fabrication to La Brea. He said other projects were Phoenix Park Industrial Estate, San Fernando Waterfront Redevelopment and Regeneration project, development of an administrative complex at Chancery Lane, San Fernando. new fishing port in Moruga and rehabilitation of the Moruga Road. He said if required counselling services will be provided to members of fence line communities. \u201cHowever more appropriately there will be community engagement to ensure that members avail themselves to the opportunities.\u201d\n"

            "text": " Mexico City/Washington, D.C., April 20, 2016 \u2013 IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and the China-Mexico Fund (CMF), a $1.2 billion private equity fund managed by the IFC Asset Management Company (AMC), will invest $200 million in Citla Energy, SAPI de CV (\u201cCitla\u201d or \u201cCitla Energy\u201d), a Mexican independent oil exploration and production (\u201cE&P\u201d) company sponsored and controlled by affiliates of ACON Investments, L.L.C. (\u201cACON\u201d).\u00a0IFC will commit an equity investment of $60 million and CMF will commit $140 million. The $200 million investment is IFC\u2019s and the CMF\u2019s first investment in Citla Energy as part of a greater equity financing package provided by ACON, which includes capital from Mexican pension funds through a CKD managed locally by ACON. Founded by ACON in 2015, Citla is actively building a portfolio of selected E&P assets in Mexico, both independently and in partnership with other industry participants.\u00a0Mexico is one of the leading oil and gas producers in the world, yet faces a consistent decline in output due primarily to underinvestment. A groundbreaking constitutional reform passed in 2013 aims to promote private sector involvement in the Mexican oil industry through an unprecedented market liberalization coupled with the mobilization of resources by Pemex, among other measures. This investment is a result of the attractive economic conditions fostered by the reform.\u00a0Citla is uniquely positioned to develop a balanced portfolio of oil and gas assets, thereby opening up new hydrocarbon discoveries in the region, spurring broader participation of local companies and triggering economic stimulus and growth for the country. Citla\u2019s portfolio expansion and growth will be achieved through bidding awards, acquisitions, farm-ins and partnerships with other operators.\u00a0Alberto Galvis, Citla\u2019s CEO, said: \u201c\u201cThis investment reinforces Citla\u2019s position as an independent and institutional platform with resources to access carefully selected opportunities of the Mexican Energy Reform.\u201d\u00a0Jorge Dickens, Managing Partner at ACON, said: \u201cIFC and AMC\u2019s experience and footprint will be a great complement to ACON. This partnership will help make Citla a regional industry leader that will operate under the highest international standards.\u201d\u00a0Ary Na\u00efm, Country Manager of IFC M\u00e9xico, said: \u201cAs Mexico opens its oil and gas sector to private competition, IFC\u2019s goal is to support new players that combine strong sector expertise, local and global know-how, and adequate capitalization, and Citla Energy reflects all them. With this investment, IFC, AMC, Citla Energy and ACON send a strong signal of confidence in the Mexican Energy Reform agenda.\u201d\u00a0Cesar Urrea, Head of the IFC Asset Management Company CMF, noted: \u201cWith this first investment in Citla, we are fulfilling the CMF\u2019s objective to bring substantial risk capital to support attractive investment projects that are partly a result of the Mexican Government\u2019s current reforms. We look forward to continuing to invest in new equity or mezzanine projects that help maximize the impact of the reforms and their impact on the country\u2019s social and economic growth.\u201d\u00a0IFC\u2019s strategy in Mexico focuses on supporting private sector investment to accelerate growth, improve competitiveness, foster social inclusion, and reduce poverty. As of Fiscal Year 2015, IFC\u2019s portfolio in Mexico totaled $1.4 billion representing investments in 57 companies. Mexico ranks seventh for IFC in terms of investment volume in a single country.\u00a0About IFC\u00a0IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. Working with more than 2,000 businesses worldwide, we use our capital, expertise, and influence, to create opportunity where it\u2019s needed most. In FY15, our long-term investments in developing countries rose to nearly $18 billion, helping the private sector play an essential role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.

The ballot is part of the country\u2019s tradition of direct democracy, which lets citizens weigh in on topics ranging from taxes to immigration. Results are due in the afternoon. Voters are getting a say on a trade agreement with Indonesia after a campaign by activists because of environmental concerns over palm oil. Support for the pact was 52%, according to a poll last month for broadcaster SRG. Indonesia is the world\u2019s biggest producer of the oil -- used in everything from chocolate to shampoo. The pact would reduce tariffs on imports of certified sustainable production. The Swiss government argues the agreement would foster sustainable business, while environmentalist are concerned sustainability labels for palm oil aren\u2019t credible and damaging practices will continue. Switzerland will also vote on a proposed ban on face coverings, which is effectively a crackdown on Islamic full-face veils.

            "text": " Curated power industry news from thousands of top sources. News By: Mao Pengfei in Mexico City for China Daily A Chinese-Mexican partnership is set to invest some $200 million to build two wind farms, the first on a windswept stretch of the Gulf of Mexico. Mexican energy developer Vive Energia and Chinese turbine manufacturer Envision Energy have joined forces to work on the green energy projects in Mexico's booming southeast Yucatan Peninsula, through their joint venture firm Renewable Energy of the Peninsula (Energia Renovable de la Peninsula). The first wind farm is to be built, with an investment of $120 million, in Progreso, a Yucatan port on the Gulf of Mexico. Its 36 120-meter-high wind turbines will churn out 90 megawatts (MW) of energy, with most of it (85 MW) to be sold to the state-run Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and the remainder to the private sector. \"This project represents the largest investment ever by any Chinese company in Mexico's wind energy sector,\" said Rafael Valdez, Envision Energy's director for Latin America. The project is one of 16 wind farms and solar plants that 11 firms from five different countries will be building in different parts of Mexico after winning the rights at a federal government auction held in late March, Mexico's daily Milenio reported at the time. In this way, Mexico's CFE aims to boost electricity to the national grid through renewable energy sources. \"We are very pleased, because out of the many investments we have seen in Latin America by the Asian country ... most have been in the extractive sector, in natural resources projects,\" Valdez said. In contrast, this project represents \"capital, technology and infrastructure that comes to Mexico to stay\", Valdez said. In addition, he said, the project will generate clean energy that will promote productivity on the peninsula, create jobs and boost revenue. Construction is expected to get underway in the second half of 2016 and be completed sometime next year, before the March 2018 deadline set by the government for starting operations. Valdez said the joint venture firm is in talks with multinational development banks and financial institutions in the two countries to drum up financing for the project, the only one in the auction that proposed a hybrid scheme to supply energy to both the CFE and the private sector. Envision Energy, China's third-largest producer of wind turbines and among the top 10 in the world, plans to bring the 36 turbines, each measuring 110 meters in diameter and capable of generating 2.5 MW of energy, over from China, while the steel towers they are mounted on will be made in Mexico. Along with the wind farm in Progreso, the joint venture is set to begin building a second wind farm in 2016 in Dzilam de Bravo, a coastal town located just more than 80 kilometers east of Progreso. This $80 million wind farm will have 70 MW in installed capacity via 28 2.5 MW wind turbines and supply energy to various companies on the peninsula, which is home to the states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo and Campeche. The head of Viva Energia, Jose Antonio Aguilar, said the decision to build the plants in the Yucatan Peninsula was based on the growing demand for electricity in the region's cities and tourist resorts, among them Cancun and the Riviera Maya, on the Caribbean coast.

Pupils have returned to lessons at \u201cabsolutely the right time\u201d, according to one headteacher. Greg Williams, of Birmingham\u2019s Jewellery Quarter Academy, said: \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been (put off) any longer\u201d. At the secondary school, which is run by CORE education trust, 325 students in Year 11, 10 and 9 were back at face-to-face lessons on Monday \u2013 many for the first time in months. On Tuesday, 270 more pupils \u2013 the rest of the school\u2019s cohort in Years 8 and 7 \u2013 are returning.AdChoicesADVERTISING Mask-wearing is mandatory at the school, but take-up has been almost universal, said the head. Mr Williams said there was currently only a single pupil who did not have to wear a mask, and that was for a medical exemption. Many have school-branded masks, which were being handed out to those who needed a face covering at the front gates, together with a squirt of hand sanitiser. Pupils have also had to get to grips with rapid-result lateral-flow tests (LFT). But take-up has again been high and by Monday morning the school had parental consent for tests for more than 530 of its 597 pupils on-roll.AdChoicesADVERTISING Mr Williams said to avoid too much disruption, it had invited pupils in at the end of last week to its own on-site test centre \u2013 named the Seacole Centre for 19th century nurse Mary Seacole, who tended to wounded soldiers in the Crimean War. More than 350 pupils took up the chance to have one of the Government-mandated three LFTs they need this week, aimed at controlling virus among the school populations. From the following week, pupils will take home school-supplied tests and use the swabs on themselves, twice-weekly. Despite the introduction of new health measures, pupils have been \u201creally keen\u201d to get back to class, with the school recording a 94% attendance on Monday, above the national average. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf teachers weren't teaching, we'd drive out and do food parcel drops\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Mr Williams said, before reopening, the school had focused on supporting pupils through remote learning, giving out 148 laptops and up to 20 dongles to allow internet access, together with BT-donated data bundles. The school\u2019s community has also been distributing food vouchers and handing out food parcels, put together and delivered by staff and volunteers over the past few months. He said: \u201cIf teachers weren\u2019t teaching, we\u2019d drive out and do food parcel drops.\u201d In recent weeks, following the Government announcement of a full return to classes, staff have also been doing door-step visits to many pupils, so youngsters and parents could be briefed on what to expect. The testing regime, in an on-site testing facility run by school staff and three volunteers, takes about an hour. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I saw how hard the school had worked to keep children safe, I thought I would volunteer to help them continue to do that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Josie Wall, a volunteer tester, said: \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the school previously, through the Jewellery Quarter Cemetery Project. \u201cWhen I saw how hard the school had worked to keep children safe, I thought I would volunteer to help them continue to do that.\u201d Pupils were taking the testing regime in their stride on Monday, before heading to their first lesson. Asked about the return for all pupils, Mr Williams said: \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been (put off) any longer. \u201cThe support we\u2019ve had from Government is clear direction, and we\u2019re really appreciative of the run-in time; the advanced notice. \u201cWe would have been ready to open the day after the announcement.\u201d He added the additional financial support from the Government had also helped, providing items such as screens for teachers\u2019 desks and in meeting rooms. That support has also allowed the purchase of 18 graphics tablets, allowing teachers in subjects such as art, science and maths to interact more closely with pupils in those subjects. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the right time for the students to come back. \u201cSchool is the best place for our students. \u201cPreparations have been extensive, we have set up a brand new testing centre. \u201cWe have also encouraged the students to come in and think about any help and support that they need, so there\u2019s an hour\u2019s time with their form tutor, just to go through that.\u201d He added: \u201cIt must be quite daunting for young people sometimes, to think about having to have regular tests and it\u2019s not something they\u2019re used to.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve put in a lot of support \u2013 our remote learning provision has been exceptional. \u201cBut they want to come back today. \u201cVery early this morning, the students were arriving \u2013 much earlier than we thought.\u201d Among the students is Year 11 Dante Ross, who has his eyes set on a career in engineering. The 16-year-old, from nearby Hockley, said: \u201cI\u2019m excited to come back to school, see my friends and just get learning with teachers in a friendly environment.\u201d Asked what he had missed the most, he replied: \u201cThe social interaction with people my own age. He said the most difficult challenge had been getting used to wearing a mask, which he found \u201cclaustrophobic\u201d. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI don't think there's any substitute for face-to-face teaching\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Dante has the \u201cstressful\u201d prospect of teacher-assessed grades for his GCSEs this year, with results in August. He said: \u201cI think it will be much harder to compete against somebody in the job market, that has sat their GCSEs.\u201d Asked about the state of pupils\u2019 mental health, Mr Williams said: \u201cBy and large, our children are very resilient, and I think that is helped greatly by the frequent contact we have with them. \u201cBut it will be lovely to see them back today. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any substitute for face-to-face teaching.\u201d Mr Williams said the potential for an expanded school year would be \u201cwelcomed\u201d if it \u201ccontributes to the well-being and learning progress of students\u201d.

Protected by Google ReCAPTCHA.  \n  Friday, October 15, 2021\n \n \n      By  Press release submission  |\n    Mar 8, 2021\n  Illinois Attorney General issued the following announcement on Mar. 4.  Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Federal Trade Commission, along with regulators from 38 states and the District of Columbia, announced a settlement with 13 defendants over a national charitable fundraising operation that bombarded 67 million individuals across the country with approximately 1.3 billion deceptive fundraising calls, most of which were illegal robocalls. Raoul and the coalition allege the defendants collected more than $110 million that did not go toward the charitable programs and services donors believed they were supporting. Raoul\u2019s office was part of the negotiating committee that reached the settlement with Michigan-based professional fundraiser Associated Community Services (ACS) and its sister companies, Central Processing Services and Community Services Appeal; the companies\u2019 owners, Dick Cole, Bill Burland, Barbara Cole and Amy Burland; and ACS\u2019 senior managers Nikole Gilstorf, Tony Lia, John Lucidi and Scot Stepek (ACS defendants). The settlement also includes two other related fundraising companies, Directele and The Dale Corporation, allegedly operated by Gilstorf and Lia as ACS spin-off companies (Directele defendants). \u201cThe defendants did more than bombard Illinois residents with tens of millions of fundraising calls \u2013 they did so using illegal robocalls and harassment. On top of that, they kept much of the money people donated to support important charitable causes,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cI am proud to have partnered with the FTC and bipartisan coalition to hold the defendants accountable and end their fraudulent practices.\u201d \u201cDeceptive charitable fundraising can be big business for scammers, especially when they use illegal robocalls,\u201d said Daniel Kaufman, acting director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cThe FTC and our state partners are prepared to hold fraudsters accountable when they target generous consumers with lies.\u201d Raoul and the coalition filed the settlement with the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that since at least 2008, the defendants made deceptive high-pressure fundraising pitches on behalf of numerous organizations, including those claiming to support homeless veterans, victims of house fires, breast cancer patients and children with autism. The defendants allegedly were aware that the organizations for which they raised funds spent little or no money on the charitable causes they claimed to support \u2013 in some cases as little as one-tenth of 1%. Instead, the defendants allegedly kept as much as 90 cents of every dollar they solicited. Additionally, Raoul and the coalition allege ACS made harassing calls, calling more than 1.3 million phone numbers more than 10 times in a single week and 7.8 million numbers more than twice in an hour. More than 500 phone numbers were even called 5,000 times or more. The complaint also alleges that in many instances ACS, and later Directele, knowingly violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) by making telemarketing calls using soundboard technology, which allows an operator to play pre-recorded messages instead of speaking to call recipients. The TSR prohibits the use of such technology in all calls to first-time donors and in calls to prior donors unless call recipients are given the ability to opt out of all future calls. Raoul and the coalition allege the defendants did not make that disclosure. Most of Directele\u2019s soundboard calls originated from call centers in the Philippines and India. The complaint alleges the defendants made approximately 53 million fundraising calls to Illinois residents and violated Illinois\u2019 laws governing charities, the FTC Act, the TSR, and numerous other laws in other states. The settlement permanently prohibits the ACS defendants from conducting or consulting on any fundraising activities and from conducting telemarketing of any kind. In addition, the ACS defendants will be prohibited from using any existing donor lists and from further violations of state charitable giving laws, as well as from making misrepresentations about a product or service. The ACS defendants will also each be subject to a $110,063,843 monetary judgment. \n            Sign-up and get latest news about the courts, judges and latest complaints - right to your\n            inbox.\n           Additionally, the settlement requires Directele and The Dale Corporation to cease operations and dissolve. The remaining Directele defendants are each permanently prohibited from fundraising or consulting on behalf of any charitable or nonprofit organizations similar to those described in the complaint. They also are permanently prohibited from using robocalls to conduct any form of telemarketing, using abusive calling practices, or making misrepresentations about a product or service. In addition, all of the Directele defendants are subject to a monetary judgment of $1.6 million, and Directele\u2019s operators, defendants Gilstorf and Lia, are also subject to a monetary judgment of $110,063,843.  The funds being surrendered by the defendants will be paid to an escrow fund held by the state of Florida and, following a motion by the participating states and approval by the court, be contributed to one or more legitimate charities that support causes similar to those for which the defendants solicited.

A first in the Caribbean region for China Aid, the project exceeded target to repair 250 damaged roofs to strengthened national building code standards, with a total of 302 homes and essential facilities served with roofing materials, during the six-month relief and recovery project completed on 30 June. \u201cThanks to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the People\u2019s Republic of China, the project exceeded all targets and expectations - this is a model that can be replicated in other countries - providing significant help, and stronger resilience against future hurricanes,\u201d said Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne at the Closing Ceremony in Codrington, Barbuda on 12 July 2018. The Chinese Government made a significant commitment to restore 250 damaged roofs under a Build Back Better Principle and, with government, \u201cUNDP designed the project to procure and transport reroofing materials to Barbuda and provide technical assistance to the National Office of Disaster Services (NODS) and building contractors,\u201d said UNDP Resident Representative Barbados & OECS, Mr Stephen O\u2019Malley. \u201cAs we drove today, we can see so many more children on the island now\u201d he commented on the number of families returning to Barbuda and their newly repaired homes, after nine months of living away following evacuation of all 1800 residents when Irma destroyed the tropical island. Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to Antigua and Barbuda HE Wang Xianmin was impressed by the speed of the rebuilding which began on his first visit to the Irma-stricken Barbuda in January 2018 \u2013 and success of the new trilateral model under South-South Cooperation - with the People\u2019s Republic of China providing the funds for reroofing materials, the government hiring contractors and coordinating repairs, and UNDP implementing the project. Authorities during the ceremony highlighted that the initiative provided significant help, and stronger resilience against future hurricanes, to the disaster impacted island. A thousand people have now returned to Barbuda, as estimated by Red Cross \u2013 over half the population of this small Caribbean island -\u00a0 but an estimated $222 million is still needed to repair the damage, according to national assessments. \u201cIt will take time \u2013 but Barbuda has made more progress than other islands in the region, we need to be appreciative of the assistance already received from our donor friends,\" said Prime Minister Browne.\u00a0\n\n\u201cToday, the landscape has changed for the better \u2013 a different story to what I saw a few hours after the hurricane\u201d. Joint project: A Hurricane Irma rebuilding initiative, this is a joint project implemented by UNDP with the Government of Antigua & Barbuda (National Office of Disaster Services \u2013 NODS) supported by the China Aid program under South-South Cooperation. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n          \n          \u00a9\n          2021\n          \u00a0\n          United Nations Development Programme"

Although minor works are still ongoing the new Newtown Primary School was officially handed over to the Ministry of Education last week.   The Ambassador to China for Dominica and the Minister of Education and Human Resource Development signed the handing over certificates of the school on January 20 at the Ministry of Education Conference Room.   \"The Newtown School is another example of strong friendships between the two countries and this is the eleventh year of diplomatic relations we have managed to come a long way many achievements have been made in the past,\" said the Ambassador of China to Dominica Li Jiangning.   Meanwhile, the Minister of Education and Human Resource Development Petter Saint Jean said that the students have moved in to the school for the commencement of the new school term since the construction is completed.    He noted that the school was not significantly affected by the passage of Tropical Storm Erika therefore the contractor was able to put the finishing touches in the last couple of months of 2015.   Saint Jean said that prior to the opening of the school it was assessed by officials of the Ministry of Education.\n\"Two weeks ago officials of the Ministry of Education along with the project supervisor visited the site of the new school to assess its readiness for the open,\" he said.   Saint Jean said the new Newtown Primary School is a state of the art facility equipped with new and improved amenities.     He noted that the school is equipped with large student friendly classrooms, rooms designated for art and craft and information technology, a library, kitchen, office space and staff quarters for school administration and teachers, a sick bay and an elevator that caters to the needs of physically challenged students.   In addition, Saint Jean said work is ongoing towards fencing the school scheduled to go on till February.    \"Work is ongoing on the school grounds, while significant progress has been made to level and prepare the yard for sporting activities and to clear the grounds of all debris associated with building the construction of the perimeter fence will continue well into the month of February,\" he said.   Saint Jean said his ministry is extremely pleased with the new school.   He noted that this gift was much needed and was a long overdue educational institution for the people of Newtown.     \n Saint Jean said that construction of the new Newtown Primary School serves as a permanent reminder of the genuine relationship between the Commonwealth of the Dominica and the People's Republic of China.   Lastly, he noted that \"As Minister I want to encourage the people of Newtown to take ownership of the building that is serves successive generations.\" "

The country is up in flames. So far more than 50 have been killed. Well over 1700 have been arrested, and a violent showdown between the protesters and heavily armed security forces has become more a routine than an exception. Reports of confrontation between the military and the agitators seeking return of democracy and release of Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon, Mandalay and other places are trickling on a regular basis. The scene looks perilous. The villain behind crushing the democratic future of Myanmar and causing a Coup d\u2019etat is 64-year-old General Min Aung Hlaing who has been functioning as the army chief of Myanmar since 2011. Known for his ruthless response against any civilian uprising, Gen Hlaing, a law graduate himself, came to adverse light in 2009 when as a \u201cbattle-hardened warrior\u201d of the Myanmar military, he ruthlessly launched a military offensive in Kokang region crushing the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance.\u00a0  Also Read | Opinion- Myanmar: Exploiting lessons learnt in the Middle East This infamous General is also singularly responsible for the brutal crackdown on the Rohingyas in 2017 resulting in the influx of nearly 7 million of them into Bangladesh in the last over three years, the number has exceeded 10 million. This shows his heartlessness and resolve to sabotage any chances of democracy trying to find a space in the political landscape of Myanmar.  Meanwhile, the ongoing political turbulence and incessant crackdown on the defiant protesters have drawn acerbic criticism from the UN. UN Human Rights Chief, Michelle Rachelet, in a recent statement, called upon the military to stop forthwith the vicious repression and killings of the innocents.\u00a0 ASEAN calls for an end to perpetration of excesses have also fallen on deaf ears like the appeals from the UN. There have been more than visible protest demonstrations in front of the Indonesian and Thai Embassies in Myanmar that have not resulted in any impact except stirring an increasing public opinion against the military.\u00a0 Public is surely in a defiant mood.\u00a0 Slogans and placards are carrying banner headlines that say \u201cStone Age is over\u201d. \u00a0They are also ranting that the protesters are no longer afraid of any threat from the military. The cities in Myanmar are dotted with barricades and fortifications, never seen before of this scale. The country, since its independence, has seen five military takeovers dating from 1948 but the resistance put up this time seems unprecedented. Several \u201cpeople\u2019s governing bodies\u201d have been formed which pose a direct challenge to the military leadership.\u00a0 Their resorting to lobbing of stun grenades and firing of live ammunition have also been proving ineffective. Foreign Minister of Singapore, Vivian Balakrishnan on March 5 has described in the Parliament, the happenings in Myanmar as national shame including the armed forces' use of weapons against its own people. Amid these happenings, credible reports suggest that the military leadership in Myanmar has tried to withdraw one billion US dollars from Federal Reserve after seizing power on Feb 1. The US has put a freeze on the transaction. \u00a0It\u2019s further known now that the Central Bank of Myanmar had tried to siphon off the money from the US. The US is trying to ascertain the names of those involved in this attempt to withdraw money as the US, the UK, EU and Canada have imposed fresh sanctions on Myanmar. At the same time, however, there seems to be a concerted disinformation campaign unleashed by the military as seen from disclosure by an ex-Israeli military intelligence officer who is also a Canadian citizen. Ari Ben Menashe, who claims to have intervened in military regimes of Sudan and other conflict zones, said that he has been hired by the Myanmar military to do some damage control lest its image is tarnished in the eyes of the US and other western countries. Menashe\u2019s firm is known as Dickens & Madsons.\u00a0 Canada hinted that Myanmar military leadership is trying to distance itself from China so that it\u2019s not seen as a Chinese puppet. This looks surprising and couldn\u2019t be independently verified at this juncture. Menashe further claimed that Myanmar is trying to take back Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh and its using diplomatic channels in Saudi Arabia and the UAE for their early return. This again appears intriguing yet it needs close monitoring. Meanwhile, inputs as of March 7 reveal that there were sporadic incidents of violence during clashes between the security forces in different parts of Myanmar with protesters intensifying their tirade against the military regime. There have been raids in the houses of hundreds of protesters and one activist of the National League for Democracy (NLD), Khin Maung Latt died in military custody allegedly after he was tortured. A northern Shan State city Lashio saw a barrage of police firing, stun grenades and tear-gassing that injured many.\u00a0 There is an uneasy calm prevailing in many parts of Myanmar. As regards to India, its borders with Myanmar need to be extra vigilant to prevent unauthorised entry of the victims of the military. A section of the Myanmar military is believed to have told the Indian authorities to return many Myanmar policemen who are thought to have crossed over to the Indian side in the state of Mizoram to escape the military onslaught. As things unfold dramatically in Myanmar with the rising military oppression and the anti-coup protestors stepping up their aggressive opposition, a longish stand-off between the military-led government and the pro-democracy forces looks certain in the near foreseeable future. India, diplomatically, has so far played its card with dexterity and patience at the same time eyeing the situation closely to act and react as the ground situation demands.

            "text": " DUBAI (Reuters) \u2013     The United States on Monday expressed alarm at \u201cgenuine security threats\u201d to Saudi Arabia from Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthis and elsewhere in the region after attacks on the heart of the Saudi oil industry, and it would look at improving support for Saudi defences. Earlier in the day, the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh said Washington was committed to defending Saudi following Sunday\u2019s volley of drones and missiles, including one aimed at a Saudi facility vital to oil exports.  \u201cWe continue to be alarmed by the frequency of Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia. Escalating attacks like these are not the actions of a group that is serious about peace,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. \u201cWe understand that they face genuine security threats from Yemen and others in the region\u2026We will look for ways to improve support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to defend its territory against threats,\u201d Psaki told a Washington news briefing. Saudi-led coalition authorities said most of Sunday\u2019s drones and missiles were intercepted en route to their targets and there were no casualties or property losses from the attacks. They targeted an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, site of a refinery and the world\u2019s biggest offshore oil-loading facility, and a residential compound in Dhahran used by state-controlled oil giant Saudi Aramco. [L1N2L502H]  The attacks, which drove Brent crude prices above $70 a barrel to their highest since January 2020, come at a time of friction in the decades-old alliance between Saudi Arabia and the United States as President Joe Biden puts pressure on Riyadh over its human rights record and the ruinous Yemen war. \u201cThe United States stands by Saudi Arabia and its people. Our commitment to defend the kingdom and its security is firm,\u201d the U.S. Embassy said in an Arabic-language Twitter post. The Houthis have been battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for six years in a conflict largely regarded as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. In new incidents on Monday, the coalition said it had intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile and an explosive drone fired towards parts of the kingdom\u2019s southern region.  The Houthi military claimed to have hit a military target at Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abha airport, near the Yemen border, with a new type of ballistic missile.  ACCUSATIONS Saudi Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki, who also speaks for the coalition, said on Al Arabiya TV that Iran was smuggling missiles and drones to the Houthis. The Houthis and Tehran have in the past rejected such charges. [D5N2JU016] Riyadh has repeatedly said that Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme and support for regional proxies including in Yemen should be part of any talks aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran that Biden\u2019s predecessor Donald Trump quit. The Houthi movement said its operation on Sunday using 14 drones and eight ballistic missiles also attacked military targets in the Saudi cities of Dammam, Asir and Jazan. The coalition said it destroyed 12 Houthi drones, without specifying locations in the kingdom, and two ballistic missiles launched towards Jazan. The Saudi Defence Ministry later said it had intercepted an armed drone coming from the sea before it could hit its target at Ras Tanura. Shrapnel from a ballistic missile fell near the residential compound used by Aramco. The two sites in Eastern Province are located on the Gulf coast across from Iran and near Iraq and Bahrain, which is the regional base of the U.S. Navy. Yemen lies nearly 1,000 km (600 miles) southwest on the Gulf of Aden. Eastern Province has most of Aramco\u2019s production and export facilities. In 2019, Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, was shaken by a big attack on oil installations just a few km (miles) from the facilities targeted on Sunday, which Riyadh blamed on Iran, an accusation Tehran denies. The 2019 attack, which was claimed by the Houthis but which Riyadh said did not originate from Yemen, forced Saudi Arabia to temporarily shut more than half of its crude output.  The United States later sent American troops and military equipment to bolster the kingdom\u2019s air and missile defences. The Houthis have stepped up attacks as the United States and United Nations have been pushing for a ceasefire to revive stalled Yemen peace talks. Biden has declared a halt to U.S. support for coalition offensive operations in Yemen but said Washington would continue to help Saudi Arabia defend itself.  On Sunday, the Saudi-led coalition said the Houthis were emboldened after the Biden administration revoked terrorist designations on the group imposed by Trump. \n \n (This story corrects Jen Psaki\u2019s job title to White House press secretary instead of U.S. State Department spokeswoman, paragraph 3) \n  (Reporting by Gulf team, Ellen Francis and Maher Chmaytelli in Dubai and Patricia Zengerle in Washington; Writing by Ghaida Ghantous and Lisa Barrington; Editing by Mark Heinrich) Subscribe Sign up for our daily news explosion."

            "text": " Call: +44 (0) 20 7779 7227 \n08 March 2021 | Melanie Mingas\n \n        The Philippines' third telco has launched commercial services today local time, starting a new era for the country's telecoms sector. \n     Dito Telecommunity is now providing mobile connectivity in 15 areas across Metro Cebu and Metro Davao. Dito will expand into other areas in the next few months, with a target of nationwide mobile coverage by mid-2021 and a subsequent broadband services launch in 2022, according to chief administrative officer Adel Tamano. Dito, formerly known as Mindanao Islamic Telephone (Mislatel), received its operating permit in July 2019 following a $5.4 billion agreement between Udenna and China Telecom. As Capacity reported in February 2020, Dito is also planning an extensive subsea network and a 10,000-15,000km fibre network. As a partner, China Telecom will provide international connectivity, Dito\u2019s CTO Rodolfo Santiago told local media last year. Quality communications are a pressing issue in the Philippines, which has become a hub for outsourced work from western nations, particularly Australia. This drives demand for stable and high-speed connections, but local providers have been on the backfoot at times for both mobile and fixed. Internet speeds in the Philippines have increased 477% since Q3 2016, but they still lag the speeds recorded in other countries, according to research. Insight from Ookla ranked the country 111th for its mobile speeds and 107th for fixed broadband, in October 2020. Several times in 2020, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte called out the quality of communications services, and at one point issued a deadline for improvement. He even called services \"lousy\", an insult he has used to describe everything from corruption probes against him, to the United States. Although highly anticipated, Dito's launch has not been without controversy. The official who led the move to select a third mobile operator for the Philippines resigned from government last year. Eliseo Rio, the under-secretary at the country\u2019s Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) suggested that disagreements with the minister were behind his February 2020 resignation. \u00a0 \n\n                            8h | Melanie Mingas\n                            \n                         \n\n                            10h | Melanie Mingas\n                            \n                         \n\n                            10h | Alan Burkitt-Gray\n                            \n                         \n\n                            10h | Saf Malik \n                            \n                         +44 (0) 20 7779 7227 info@capacitymedia.com \u00a9 2021 Capacity Media is part of the Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC group "

The Government of Grenada and the People\u2019s Republic of China signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 initiative on Wednesday at the Ministry of Tourism conference room. The Belt and Road initiative is seen as another important one that will bring tremendous benefits to the people of both countries to promote international cooperation to a larger scale. Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to Grenada Dr. Zhao Yongchen said over 100 countries have signed the MOU with China for the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 initiative that was supported by many important persons of the UN General Assembly. He highlighted that at the beginning of the year the second ministry meeting of China and the Community of Latin America and Caribbean Countries was held in Chile where participating countries adopted a statement of the Belt and Road initiative.\u00a0 Over the past six months five Caribbean countries including Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Guyana and Suriname have signed MOU\u2019S signaling cooperation with China on the Belt and Road initiative. According to ambassador, with the signing of the MOU Grenada will become a new member of the initiative of the Belt and Road family. China and Grenada have now come a new state of working more closely together to promote cooperation in many areas. Dr Zhao said among the continuing areas of cooperation between the two countries they need to enhance infrastructure connectivity to improve people\u2019s living standards. The 2nd phase of low-income housing must be attended to, he said. He also mentioned the need to increase connectivity in colleges from both sides and to carry out pupil-to-pupil cooperation in science, education, and culture amongst others.\u00a0 Medical coverage between China and Grenada will be another asset and the Chinese Peace Ark (Hospital Ship) will make its second visit soon to provide medical services to the Grenadian people.\u00a0 Grenada\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter David said the initiative is a strategy of the Chinese Government that focuses on connectivity and cooperation with different regions of the world. He said objectives would be met with a US$40 billion fund investment in infrastructure. The Belt and Road initiative he said facilitates the movement of goods and capital between developing areas of the world.\u00a0 China has been the center of global economics and politics and today they are the second largest economy in the world and have been a leading development partner to countries in Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean.\u00a0 He noted that despite China\u2019s enormous and rapid development, they are a developing country; despite the fact China has its own development challenges and a lot to be done, they have found it in them to assist in the development and also to have a good relationship with countries such as Grenada.\u00a0 He went on to say that China\u2019s invitation to Grenada to participate in the initiative presents an important opportunity to sustain the economic gains in Grenada. The Belt and Road\u2019 initiative he said is another milestone and is expected to give Grenada access to inexpensive capital since China is known for its strategic planning.\u00a0 The minister thanked the People\u2019s Republic of China for their great initiative extended to Grenada and wishes to continue the excellent relationship they have established.\u00a0 2013 \u00a9 Dwayne Francique Moving Target Group of Companies.

            "text": " (JTA) \u2014 A founder of a Jewish patrol group in Brooklyn is facing federal sexual misconduct charges stemming from a 2017 case in which he was charged with the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl. Jacob Daskal, 62, was arrested and charged Thursday with inciting a minor to engage in illicit sexual activity and transporting a minor for the purposes of engaging in sexual activity. The charges brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office were related to the same victim, according to the New York Daily News, but also included activities that occurred in Chicago as well as upstate New York. They fall outside the jurisdiction of the Brooklyn District Attorney, which charged Daskal with rape and sexual abuse among other crimes in 2018. In light of the federal charges, the ones brought by the Brooklyn District Attorney are expected to be dropped, according to a law enforcement source. Daskal, who is among the founders of the Borough Park Shomrim, allegedly groomed the teen for sex in 2017 between August and November. According to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, the relationship began in Brooklyn and continued at Daskal\u2019s home in upstate South Fallsburg. When the girl moved to Chicago in October 2017, Daskal texted and Skyped with her and requested that she pose nude in photos and on video chats. The following month, Daskal is alleged to have traveled to Chicago to bring the girl to a hotel room, where he engaged in sexual activity with her. Daskal was still at the helm of the Shomrim, one of a number of Orthodox patrol groups with close ties to local police, during the period when he was alleged to have been abusing the victim. The Shomrim patrols have come under greater scrutiny in recent years following instances in which members have admitted to assaulting a Black man in a Hasidic neighborhood, attempting to bribe the police and waiting to call law enforcement after a Hasidic boy was abducted in 2011. Critics have also noted their close ties to law enforcement and consistent funding from local officials, leading to claims that the Shomrim as a private group is not subject to public scrutiny like the police and has amassed too much power. A Shomrim leader claimed to the Forward in 2016 that the group could get members of the Hasidic community released from minor charges without having to go through the police central booking system.

            "text": " Chapter two By RAQUEL CARVALHO MAY 25, 2019 \n             Investments from Beijing have brought infrastructure and jobs \u2013 but they have also seen communities forced off their land as well as the murder of a strident critic. To some Ecuadoreans, the social and environmental impact is too high a cost\n         On the way from the town of Gualaquiza to Tundayme village, in the southeast of Ecuador, the only thing as heavy as the trees and vegetation on either side of the road are the showers that often drench them.\n     Interspersed among the waves of green are small settlements of single-storey houses, known as Shuar centres after their inhabitants, Ecuador\u2019s second-biggest indigenous group. Also making their home here are pumas, parrots, monkeys and toucans. It\u2019s an unassuming part of the country, with few cars on the roads. Tourist leaflets describe this region as the \u201cPearl of the Amazon\u201d, ready to be discovered by intrepid travellers \u2013 but that is not what it has become most known for.\n The biodiversity that makes it stand out, some fear, may soon be gone thanks to the country\u2019s largest mine. Humans are making their presence felt in the middle of the jungle, where tall electricity transmission towers have sprouted among the trees. The lively green fields and woodlands are now dotted with signs warning that the area is private property. By the road, construction signs can be found in both Spanish and Chinese.\n     This development is the result of the Mirador project, a US$1.4 billion open-pit mega mine set up to extract primarily copper but also silver and gold. The mine, located in the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor mountain range \u2013 in the eastern branch of the Andes and the lowlands of the Ecuadorean Amazon \u2013 is being built and operated by EcuaCorriente S.A., a subsidiary of state-owned Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan Investment Co.\n Although concessions have been awarded since the 1990s for the development of an exploration programme in the area, the country\u2019s first ever large-scale mining contract was only signed in March 2012. \u201cComrades, today marks the beginning of a new era in Ecuador,\u201d former president Rafael Correa said at the time. Ecuador is not traditionally a mining country, but the industry was given a more prominent role during the Correa administration. His government, which was marked by strained relations with the United States, looked into diversifying the economy from its dependency on oil exports by attracting external investment to tap into the country\u2019s rich mineral reserves. \n Although Mirador is considered the country\u2019s most significant mining project, several concessions for major projects have been granted in recent years, many of them to Chinese companies.  At some 16 million people, Ecuador\u2019s entire population is smaller than that of Beijing \u2013 but despite its size, the country isn\u2019t just attractive to investors from the Middle Kingdom, it has rung up a huge debt with China. Out of 15 countries in Latin America that have received Chinese funding, Ecuador is among the top three borrowers, with a total of 15 loans estimated at US$18.4 billion. As of last year, only Brazil (US$28.9 billion) and Venezuela (US$67.2 billion) \u2013 both major players in the region \u2013 received more money from China than Ecuador, according to the China-Latin America Finance Database.\n While deeply in debt, Ecuador is also struggling to cope with corruption, environmental problems and an increasing number of critics who have cast doubt on its deals with Chinese companies.  The Mirador mining project sprawls across 10,000 hectares. Photo: Raquel Carvalho THE LAST MAN\nTundayme, in the province of Zamora Chinchipe, has become the most visible face of the country\u2019s new political and economic direction. But while some welcome the Mirador project and believe it will boost Ecuador\u2019s economy, others argue it has so far brought more damage than development. In February, Vice-minister of Mines Fernando Benalc\u00e1zar said 75 per cent of the project had been completed, and that production was expected to begin in December.\n The mine covers some 10,000 hectares, and the Ministry of Mining calculates it will produce 3.18 million tonnes of copper, 843.21 tonnes of silver and 105.44 tonnes of gold. Residents of Tundayme claim the Mirador\u2019s impact is already visible, even though the project is in the early stages of operation. The region\u2019s mountains are being carved up, there is ongoing deforestation and rivers are being discoloured by run-off from the mine. Mariano Mashendo, a stiff man who rarely smiles, has seen it all. He used to live fairly close to the community of San Marcos, which was evicted to make way for the project.\n To get to his house \u2013 the only dwelling for several kilometres \u2013 it is necessary to descend a hill, brave thick vegetation and jump over a small river.  Mashendo fears he will be forced out of his house, as the Mirador mine is expected to start production later in 2019. Photo: Raquel Carvalho Mashendo, 65, is a Shuar \u2013 one of the biggest ethnic groups in the Amazon region, with between 35,000 and 40,000 people living mainly in the southeastern provinces of Ecuador. They have been one of the most strident indigenous groups fighting against intrusive projects in their territory. Visible from where Mashendo lives is a mountain known for its resemblance to an indigenous person\u2019s face. Further below are some new signs of human encroachment. \u201cThose were built by the mining company,\u201d he says, pointing to small white constructions on the slope of the mountain.\n     Ducklings and chickens walk around Mashendo while he sits on a wooden bench, their quacking and chirping almost as loud as his voice.\n             \u201cAs you can see, I am here alone after they destroyed the community,\u201d he says, referring to San Marcos, whose residents had their land seized by the government. \u201cI rarely have visitors. I spend eight or 15 days without seeing people. Living alone is bad.\u201d Mashendo, who mostly lives off bananas he grows and his poultry, says he has also been told to leave. Mashendo\u2019s house is the only dwelling for several kilometres. The Shuar are one of the biggest ethnic groups in the Amazon region. Photos: Raquel Carvalho \u201cThey are starting the works now \u2026 Things will get worse,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel sad, because if they force me to leave, I do not have anywhere to go. I would be like a dog and die in a place that I don\u2019t know. \n \u201cThey should go away from here. I am Ecuadorean \u2026 I belong to this land.\u201d\n LAND GRABS\nSome of the most dramatic episodes in Tundayme happened between 2014 and 2016, when more than 100 people were forced out of their homes.\n The negotiation and purchase of rural properties in the region began several years earlier. Some land owners received financial compensation for their properties and voluntarily moved out, but others did not agree to sell their land. EcuaCorriente then filed for right of way through the area, and subsequently asked the government to evict the remaining property owners \u2013 mechanisms allowed under the Ecuadorean mining law. About 26 families were evicted from San Marcos and the surrounding areas, according to experts, involving 116 people \u2013 52 children and teenagers among them.They all lost their homes as well as their cultivation areas, which were for many their only means of subsistence. William Uyuguari, 37, was among those who were forced to leave in September 2015.  William Uyuguari, from a small community in Tundayme, wants justice after his house was bulldozed to make way for the Mirador mine. Photo: Raquel Carvalho  \u201cThere was never a consultation. And we were evicted overnight without being able to do anything about it,\u201d he says, using his work-worn hands for emphasis.\n \u201cThey took us from our houses as if we were criminals. And they gave us five minutes to leave \u2013 with children and elderly seeing the machines coming and demolishing our houses.\u201d\n The Ecuadorean government and authorities have insisted no violence was used, and that they strictly followed legal procedures. Authorities also say people will be allowed to return to their land after the project is complete \u2013 which is expected to take more than 20 years.\n \u201cIt may take decades. And in what condition is our land going to be? It will be destroyed,\u201d says Uyuguari, who has become the leader of Cascomi \u2013 Comunidad Amaz\u00f3nica Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor Mirador \u2013 an organisation of subsistence farmers and indigenous people who are opposed to the project.\n Uyuguari and other members of the community argue that their rights were violated. \u201cWe are campesinos, people who are used to working the land, that\u2019s how we survive. What we asked was to be relocated to similar areas. But instead [EcuaCorriente] went there, offered some money [to the people in the area as compensation for their land] and that was it,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of us don\u2019t care about money,\u201d Uyuguari insists. \u201cWhat we care about is to have a dignified house and land to work on. They don\u2019t understand this and, unfortunately, the judiciary here in Ecuador is all in favour of the big companies. The policies don\u2019t take into consideration campesinos like myself.\u201d  In a protest against the Mirador mine, demonstrators walked 580km from Tundayme to Quito over 11 days in August 2015. Photo: Camara Shuar Since he left his home, Uyuguari says he has lived in seven different rented houses in Gualaquiza \u2013 a town about half an hour away by car \u2013 and that he is struggling to make ends meet. In San Marcos, he did not have to pay rent. He had a house, land to farm and fresh food. He even used to shower in the river. Now, he has to pay for all of it. \u201cI take any job that comes up, because if there is a day I don\u2019t have work, I can\u2019t eat. I am being forced to have a very different lifestyle and getting used to this is very tough,\u201d Uyuguari says. \u201cThis has all been very painful,\u201d he says quietly, as his voice breaks and his dark eyes fill with tears. \u201cBut I still hope for justice.\u201d HOPE AND DISILLUSION\nWhile some of those who were evicted are struggling to find their feet, many Tundayme residents drift between disappointment and a lack of better options.  Authorities say displaced residents will be allowed to return to their land once the Mirador project is completedis \u2013 in more than 20 years. Photo: Raquel Carvalho The contract between the Ecuadorean government and Chinese firm EcuaCorriente was signed in 2012, and the construction of the mine began three years later. Many remember the optimism that followed. There were promises of new roads, schools and hospitals.\n \u201cAbout two years ago, we believed that there would be a big development here. Many people even moved to Tundayme, built houses here, set up businesses,\u201d says a 35-year-old business owner.\n \u201cBut now many of these houses are empty,\u201d she says, asking not to be identified for fear of reprisals from the mining company. \u201cMy business has not improved, not even a bit. The Chinese never bought anything from me. They don\u2019t support the local businesses.\u201d\n A 27-year-old woman, who moved to Tundayme expecting it to be developed, also says her business has seen better days.\n She used to sell bread to the mining company, but has since stopped. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the quality, they just want a very low price,\u201d she says, also requesting anonymity. \u201cThe business here is really slow now. It was better about a year ago, before the camps were built.\u201d\n A road to the workers\u2019 living quarters at the Mirador mine. A worker sporting a Chinese flag on his shirt. Photos: Raquel Carvalho She\u2019s referring to camps built within the mining compound, where most workers eat and sleep.  Tundayme residents also say there is a stark cultural gap between locals and Chinese workers that is hard to overcome, and interactions between the two are limited due to the language barrier.\n There were exploration works in the area for many years before the Chinese took over in 2010. \u201cWhen the Canadians were here it wasn\u2019t good, but there was some equality,\u201d said a 30-year-old former worker at the mine. \u201cThey spoke more Spanish and they ate our local food.\u201d\n EcuaCorriente is the main source of jobs in the region, so most people fear openly criticising the firm because their businesses or livelihoods rely on it. Even if they don\u2019t work for the mine, chances are that one of their relatives does. In January, the company\u2019s vice-president Mauricio N\u00fa\u00f1ez said the Mirador project had directly generated 2,400 direct jobs, and that thousands of other jobs linked to the project had been created. It is unclear how many of those employment opportunities have been taken by Ecuadoreans, particularly those from the surrounding region. Residents and some workers estimate the percentage of Chinese workers to be around 40 per cent.  Tundayme residents claim the Mirador\u2019s impact is already visible, even though it is only in the early stages of operation. Photo: Raquel Carvalho Some current and former workers have complained about low salaries, wrongful dismissals, long working hours and violation of safety regulations. Last year alone, at least three drivers died in accidents at the mine. A 31-year-old man, who provides transport services for EcuaCorriente, claims he has been poorly paid. \u201cI make about US$300 a month \u2026 And if I complain, I know I won\u2019t have any work,\u201d he says, adding that he has to spend a third of his pay on bills every month. \u201cI am not against the mine,\u201d the worker says, noting its importance for the region. \u201cBut many things have not been done properly. We Ecuadoreans are barely benefiting from this project.\u201d A full-time driver for the company, Victor Quinatoa, 33, says he enjoys his work and has few complaints.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a sociable working environment,\u201d he says, briefly, about the relationship with his Chinese colleagues. Quinatoa moved from Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, to Tundayme for work about three years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s true that there are people who are against the project. There will always be opposition, but we are trying a new form of subsistence, a new type of work that is profitable,\u201d he says.  Although he acknowledges the mine may not be the best solution for the region, Quinatoa says \u201cgiven our local economy, it\u2019s the best at the moment\u201d. FROM PROMISES TO REALITY\nThe village of Tundayme is mostly quiet, with few businesses open and not many people in the streets. But by the main road, the presence of the Mirador project becomes obvious, as there is a steady stream of trucks and cars related to the mine.  Chinese mining company Ecuacorriente is building a park in Tundayme. Photo: Raquel Carvalho\n\n  A billboard by the main road reads \u201cLa Nueva Era del Cobre\u201d \u2013 the new era of copper \u2013 announcing a US$307,144 park being built and sponsored by the firm.    \n Multiple promises of development have floated around. Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua published a piece in August claiming that EcuaCorriente \u201chas raised funds to build hospitals, schools, parks and other infrastructure. It has also established a university scholarship programme for local youths and encouraged Chinese to teach at local schools.\u201d Hu Jiandong, president of EcuaCorriente, told the agency the company had strictly followed regulations and respected protected areas. \u201cOver the years we have striven to strengthen environmental protection, support for the community, and communication with the authorities,\u201d he says. \u201cIn addition, we strictly abide by labour regulations and tax payments, and we are committed to fulfilling our social responsibilities.\u201d EcuaCorriente\u2019s social media pages are filed with job advertisements and photos of its various contributions to the community. In April, for instance, the firm posted on Twitter that it had supported a team of public doctors who had provided medical care to over 100 Shuar people in Tundayme. Other online posts show the distribution of resources worth thousands of dollars to local communities, including computers, food for animals, work-safety training and school uniforms as well as subsidies for educational programmes. However, many residents in Tundayme say they have yet to feel such a commitment. \u201cIt\u2019s true that they built roads, but it\u2019s for the convenience of the company,\u201d says a 35-year-old who was born in the region. \u201cThey also made many promises for the school. But look at it \u2026 We don\u2019t even have a library,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, there was a professor teaching Mandarin for a few months but he left and he was never replaced.\u201d Three students at the courtyard of the local school had a more supportive view of the Mirador project. They are all children of workers at the mine. \u201cThere is more work for the people from here now. But it\u2019s true that it is contaminating the rivers, the jungle \u2026 there is more rubbish,\u201d says 15-year-old Michele Ambuludi. The children also say there is a lack of better options for their parents. \u201cIf there were no jobs, they would have to migrate and go elsewhere,\u201d says Joseline Tomin, also 15. The entrance of a school in Tundayme. A look inside the school. Photos: Raquel Carvalho The three agree that since the company came to their village, their school has improved. \u201cNow we have two more areas for classes. There are still no labs \u2026 but it\u2019s much better,\u201d says Elvis Lopez, a 16-year-old who wants to become a soldier.\n\n But the president of Tundayme parish, \u00c1ngel Ar\u00e9valo, 64, seems not very impressed. Instead, he talks about the deforestation and pollution the Mirador project has brought to the region. Last year, the Ministry of Environment suspended 40 per cent of the project\u2019s construction works due to the violation of 31 environmental regulations, including a lack of reforestation. As of February, 15 per cent of the project remained suspended, according to local newspaper El Comercio. The environmental group Amazon Watch estimates that total deforestation in the region affected by the mine from 2010 to the end of 2017 was 1,307 hectares.  Residents claim that rivers have been polluted since construction of the mine began. Photo: Raquel Carvalho Along with environmental damage, \u201cthis project has sparked many social problems and tensions. It really changed our community,\u201d Ar\u00e9valo says. Many families and even villages have been split because some support the mine and others don\u2019t, he adds. \u201cThe only one that is really benefiting from it is the state. They are the ones getting the money, but the population here is not benefiting from it,\u201d Ar\u00e9valo says. \u201cIn a few years\u2019 time, we will have a country that is poorer, left destroyed \u2026 that\u2019s the only future. And we can\u2019t do anything about it. We feel powerless.\u201d LEGAL FIGHTS\nA number of protests and legal measures have been taken against the Mirador project in recent years, mostly by community-based organisations with the support of non-governmental groups and pro bono lawyers.\n However, many of those actions have failed. In the latest court decision related to the San Marcos evictions and lack of consultation, a Quito judge in January concluded that the people living in Tundayme should not be considered indigenous. Such groups in Ecuador receive greater constitutional protection, and the government has to conduct a prior consultation before extraction projects go ahead on their land. But in some cases this has not happened, and advocates now fear this requirement may be further avoided by the current administration as a new mining policy is being introduced.  About 1,300 hectares in the region affected by the mine have suffered deforestation, rights groups say. Photo: Raquel Carvalho Despite the court\u2019s decision, the former residents of San Marcos insist on their ancestral roots, many defining themselves as descendants of the Kichwa, the country\u2019s biggest indigenous group, which has lived alongside the Shuar in the region.\n Francis Andrade, the lawyer who represented the community, says she is disappointed with the latest decision.\n \u201cThis is the largest mine in the country, it\u2019s a strategic project and the government is going to hold on to it. But human rights protected by our constitution have been violated along the way,\u201d she says.  \u201cThere was no prior and informed consultation and the right to a dignified house has been infringed.\u201d Meanwhile, in March, an environmentalist and a lawyer filed a request with the Ecuadorean court to suspend the construction of the Mirador\u2019s tailing dams \u2013 the only barrier protecting nature from the toxic waste generated by mining operations.  The local community has tried to stop the mining project through legal action. Photo: Raquel Carvalho David Dene and Julio Prieto, experts who are part of the United Nations network Harmony with Nature, argue that the current design of tailings dams is not adequate for the area\u2019s natural conditions, and that there is a high chance of failure. \u201cThe construction method of the dams that [EcuaCorriente] is building at the Mirador mine is so risky that its construction is illegal in Chile and, a few weeks ago, was declared illegal in Brazil,\u201d Prieto says. The case is now being dealt with by Ecuador\u2019s Constitutional Court. This Week in Asia sent 15 questions to EcuaCorriente and exchanged multiple emails with the company\u2019s staff over the course of a month, but did not receive any answers. \n The Ecuadorean embassy in Beijing also did not respond to requests for comment.\n DEATHS AND THREATS\nWhile several court cases are still ongoing, some members of the community say they have been threatened, harassed, offered money and told to be silent.\n Community leader Uyuguari says he has grown more careful about his movements. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen to me \u2026 But I won\u2019t give up,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been fighting for something that my parents built with a lot of effort.\u201d  Jos\u00e9 Tendetza, a Shuar leader who opposed the Mirador project, left his home on November 28 and was found dead a few days later. On the right is the rope used to tie his hands. Photos: Camara Shuar\n The fight against the Mirador project took a dramatic turn at the end of 2014, when Shuar leader Jos\u00e9 Tendetza was found dead in a river near his house.\n             According to Francisco Hurtado, a human rights lawyer who followed Tendetza\u2019s case, a first autopsy concluded he had drowned, but a second autopsy requested by his family showed that he died of strangulation and that his body was thrown in the river with his hands tied behind his back. Ecuador\u2019s interior minister at the time, Jos\u00e9 Serrano, called for the investigation into Tendetza\u2019s death to be independently overseen by the indigenous Shuar federation, and a reward of US$100,000 was offered to anyone who could provide reliable information about the crime.\n Two EcuaCorriente workers were charged, but after a lengthy process no one was convicted. Till today, many believe Tendetza\u2019s killing was connected to the fact that he was an outspoken voice against the mine.  The Shuar settlement where Jos\u00e9 Tendetza used to live. Photo: Raquel Carvalho Hurtado says the investigation into his death was riddled with flaws. \u201cI am convinced there has been a deliberate action from the government for the case to remain unpunished,\u201d he says. Members of Ecuador\u2019s government have starkly denied that the state was complicit in this crime or attempted to hide evidence. Tendetza\u2019s case has been submitted to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, but no decision has been made yet.\n The grave of award-winning environmental activist Berta Caceres\u2019 in La Esperanza, Honduras. Seven men have been convicted for her murder. Photo: AFP His death is, however, far from being an isolated event. Dozens of environmental and human rights activists opposed to multinational projects have been threatened and killed across Latin America, as investigations are often dropped for lack of evidence.\n             Mario Melo, a leading human rights lawyer and professor at Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador, says authorities have used force disproportionately, and that members of the communities who have opposed projects across the country have been intimidated and threatened. Some were even accused of terrorism.\n\n             \u201cThe judicial apparatus has been used to persecute social networks,\u201d says Melo, who is also the co-author of a book about Chinese investment in the Ecuadorean Amazon. \u201cThere has been great repression.\u201d Hurtado, meanwhile, fears that Tendetza\u2019s efforts will soon be forgotten. \u201cThe fact that Jos\u00e9 Tendetza was killed, that this case remains unpunished and that his family was silenced and isolated is profoundly racist, classist and violent.\u201d\n Brazil nut: will \u2018Tropical Trump\u2019 Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-China front crack?

Ning Hui    July 5, 2019September 7, 2020 This article is followed by\u00a0another\u00a0also written by Ning Hui, an Initium Media journalist, with support from the Pulitzer Center\u2019s Rainforest Journalism Fund and Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano of Di\u00e1logo Chino.\u00a0 In the mountains of southern Ecuador the future of a Chinese-owned gold mine hangs in the balance. Via the courts local groups have managed to stop extraction at the Rio Blanco mine. But President Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s government has appealed the ruling. The story of Rio Blanco reveals the complex problems facing mining in Ecuador: inadequate public consultations; fraught questions of indigenous identities and rights; local versus state power; the protection of scarce natural resources.  Shortly after driving through the beautiful mountains, lakes and grasslands of Ecuador\u2019s Cajas National Park, Elizabeth Durazno and I reached the first road to the Rio Blanco gold mine. Elizabeth, who hails from the village closest to the mine, frowned at the piece of wood propped up in our path. She lowered her voice to complain: \u201cWe built that road ourselves.\u00a0Now the mining company is blocking it. We don\u2019t even have the right to use our own road\u2026\u201d She and I stopped by the roadblock and a man emerged from a nearby hut. I\u2019m not sure if he was a mining company employee, but perhaps he recognised her. Without speaking he removed the pole and allowed our car to enter. She spoke proudly as we travelled up the steep mountain road: \u201cWe made our own checkpoint before they did.\u201d The first one was built in May 2018, by the villagers of San Pedro de Yumate on the other road to the gold mine. \u201cMining company vehicles are not allowed to pass,\u201d the village head had declared. As you travel higher in the Andes, the climate changes. Rio Blanco, up in the mountains, enjoys cloudless days. San Pedro de Yumate, lower down, has the humidity and precipitation of a rainforest. It rained constantly that day in San Pedro de Yumate, with the water gathering in muddy puddles. The original roadblock was still in place, with a guard hut not yet finished beside it. A slogan on a nearby wall could easily have been missed: \u201cAgainst the terrorist state accomplices of the mining transnationals!\u201d Another slogan at the entrance to the mountains was more visible, and decorated with a skull: \u201cMining pollutes water and infringes sovereignty \u2013 China out!\u201d (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) A history of broken promises As Ecuador is unindustrialised it relies heavily on oil exports and has suffered as prices have fallen in recent years. The country has a 750 kilometre stretch of mostly undeveloped deposits of copper, silver, gold and zinc.\u00a0Its government hopes mining will improve economic growth. In 2015 mining accounted for 0.42% of its GDP. The government wants that to be 4% by 2021. Chinese investment has taken a lead role in fulfilling that goal. Three of Ecuador\u2019s five most important mines are funded and operated by Chinese firms.\u00a0Both the Mirador and San Carlos-Panantza copper mines, in the Amazonian south-east corner of Ecuador, are owned by a joint venture between Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group and the China Railway Construction Corporation. The third is the Rio Blanco gold mine, owned by Hong Kong\u2019s Junefield Mineral Resources and the Hunan Gold Corporation. Way back in 1993 the British company Rio Tinto-Zinc started prospecting here, before the Canadian firm International Minerals took over. In 2013 Junefield Ecuagoldmining S.A. \u2013 the Ecuadorian arm of Junefield Mineral Resources \u2013 bought the site and in 2015 it received a license to mine. According to Junefield\u2019s\u00a0website, the Rio Blanco project includes four mining concessions covering\u00a05,708 hectares and with an expected lifetime output of 15.7 tonnes of gold and 100 tonnes of silver. Nothing impressive when compared with a major gold mining nation such as Peru, but big enough to be of strategic importance for Ecuador. In April 2018, 25 years after Rio Blanco local people heard the mountain they lived on contained gold, news broke that Junefield had officially started mining the metal. Andres Durazno, Elizabeth Durazno\u2019s uncle, is in his fifties and farms trout in a mountain lake. He looked grave as he spoke: \u201cAt first, that [British] company told us that life would be easy once there was a mine. But the reality? It\u2019s been over 20 years, has anyone\u2019s life got easier? If you ask me, we\u2019re poorer.\u201d The road in the village of Rio Blanco is empty. Elizabeth explained that 200 people once lived here, but many had moved to the historic city of Cuenca, 30 kilometres away, where there is work and a high school. Some sold their land to the mining firm before leaving. Elizabeth and her four children now live in Cuenca. About 20 local people emerge when word gets round a reporter has arrived. Most of them have worked at the mine, as cleaners, cooks, drivers or labourers. There is little other work here apart from raising fish or farming, and so any opportunity is valuable. Big mining firms need good community relations to ensure their own operations can run smoothly. The local people say that when the British and Canadian firms were prospecting they sent \u201csociologists\u201d to speak with them. They received various promises: gifts of sewing machines and cooking equipment, new clinics and roads, investment in agriculture. But \u201csoon after they\u2019d change our contact person and negotiations had to start from scratch.\u201d The talks stopped altogether when the Chinese arrived, and the number of jobs available fell. Junefield reduced the number of workers and cut hours; currently employees work an average of five days a month, meaning incomes have fallen sharply. Although drilling for oil started in Ecuador in the 1920s, mining projects run by transnational firms are much more recent. So when teams of foreigners started turning up in Rio Blanco promising to make everyone rich by digging up gold, the villagers weren\u2019t sure what to think. As Andres said: \u201cWe\u2019d never even seen a mine. We thought it would be a good thing.\u201d They soon realised the foreigners and their machines would bring huge changes but no real benefits. Both the company and the community have control over barriers that control access to one of the two roads to R\u00edo Blanco. (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) Andres lists the \u201ccrimes\u201d of Junefield: the quiet filling in of a mountain lake; the appropriation of a mountain road in use for generations, with a roadblock preventing local people using it; the storing of mining explosives near a water source. \u201cWe\u2019ve woken up now,\u201d Andres said. A young villager added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t wanted anything to do with the mine since 2017.\u201d San Pedro de Yumate is a little further away and not directly affected by the mine but opposition has been rising there too.\u00a0And its location has allowed it to cut off access to the mine. Village head Chillpi said: \u201cAt first we were like lambs obediently following the [Canadian] mining company.\u201d Local people were encouraged to attend a pro-mine demonstration in the capital city of Quito, with travel and accommodation paid for. Everyone was happy to do so but then when they wanted something the company was nowhere to be found. The villagers also blocked the road, with burning tyres, during the Canadian firm\u2019s tenure. The company\u2019s president arrived from the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, and promised to build an irrigation system, a community centre and to provide more jobs. But since Junefield took over, the two villages haven\u2019t had the chance to start negotiations. They\u2019ve never even seen a Chinese person: \u201cThey don\u2019t care about what we have to say.\u201d The two faces of President Rafael Correa In November 2017, Andres joined a demonstration against the mine in Quito where he met Yaku Sacha P\u00e9rez, a Cuenca-based lawyer specialising in water and indigenous peoples. He asked Andres if the government or company had carried out prior consultation with local communities before developing the mine. \u201cWhat\u2019s prior consultation? We\u2019d never heard of it before,\u201d Elizabeth recalled.  \u201cAgainst the terrorist state accomplices of the mining transnationals! \u2026\u00a0Against the megamining\u201d\u00a0(Image: Ning Hui) Prior consultation is a civil right, more fully expressed as the right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), included in the 2006 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The vast majority of the world\u2019s 400 million indigenous people live in poverty, accounting for 5% of the global population but 15% of the poor. Because of where they live\u00a0they are often affected by global demand for energy and resources. This led to the idea of FPIC as a prerequisite for any activity that affects their ancestral lands, territories and natural resources. But often there is little drive to protect the interests of vulnerable groups, and implementation of FPIC has been difficult in the majority of countries with indigenous populations. This was not the case in Ecuador, thanks to Rafael Correa, president of the country between 2007 and 2017. While campaigning and in office, Correa advocated for indigenous people\u2019s rights and sustainable development, and the end of \u201cexploitative capitalism\u201d by mainly American and European investors. Correa declared the country\u2019s US$3.2 billion of foreign debt illegal and refused to pay it back. When US and European firms moved out, Chinese investors moved in. The China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China lent Ecuador US$18.4 billion between 2005 and 2018. In 2008 Correa called a constitutional convention, at which FPIC and the rights of nature \u2013 the belief that all forms of life have the right to exist \u2013 were added to the country\u2019s constitution. However, the definition of FPIC in the convention was changed: the requirement for indigenous people to be informed of plans in good time was retained, but their consent was no longer needed. Ecuador still doesn\u2019t have the policies to ensure indigenous people enjoy the\u00a0right to FPIC. And while Correa benefited politically from promises to protect Amazonian ecosystems and indigenous rights, he also indicated a wish to exploit natural resources by saying things that run contrary to the spirit of the constitution such as\u00a0\u201cWe cannot be a beggar sitting atop a sack of gold\u201d. But FPIC has proved powerful in court, especially international courts. In July 2012 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (set up by the Organisation of American States to rule on whether states have violated an individual\u2019s human rights) found that foreign oil firms had taken over territories belonging to the indigenous communities in the Sarayaku region of Ecuador without prior consultation. This was a landmark decision, which gave local people in places like Rio Blanco a precedent to refer to. A key part of that precedent was protecting the FPIC rights of indigenous people. But in Rio Blanco, the local people had never heard of FPIC rights, and did not actually think of themselves as indigenous. Resistance through protest and legal action Today Rio Blanco is recognised as an indigenous community by the Federation of Indigenous and Peasant Organisations (FOA) in Azuay province, an organisation for indigenous people and farmers and part of Ecuador\u2019s Confederation of Peoples of Kichwa Nationality (ECUARUNARI). There are almost 2.6 million Kichwa in Ecuador, the country\u2019s largest indigenous ethnic group, spread across the Andes and the Amazon rainforest. ECUARUNARI works with similar bodies representing indigenous peoples based in the Amazon and on the coast, via the Confederation of Indigenous People of Ecuador (CONAIE). These bodies bring together Ecuador\u2019s four million indigenous people \u2013 25% of the country\u2019s population. Lauro Sigcha is chair of the FOA. In early 2018, after Rio Blanco local people learned they had the right to be consulted by the mining company, they contacted his organisation. (Image: Ning Hui) \u201cThe mine\u2019s actually been there for years. The villagers originally had high hopes for it.\u201d Sigcha comes from another village which has protested against mining and is familiar with these struggles. \u201cThese villages are forgotten by the government. They get no teachers, no hospitals, no roads. So when foreign mining firms turn up, the villagers hope they will meet these basic needs and provide jobs.\u201d When jobs didn\u2019t materialise, the villagers started to protest. Sigcha explained: \u201cThe villagers found that combining protests with broader social and environmental issues was more effective. So they looked for people with protest experience, and found ourselves and the lawyer, Yaku Sacha.\u201d Then the villagers\u2019 identity as indigenous people became a factor in the protests. \u201cMy father\u2019s generation would get punished by their parents if they picked up any Kichwa [language]. In Ecuador, being indigenous is nothing to be proud of,\u201d\u00a0explained Sigcha. The majority of Kichwa people simply describe themselves as farmers. Indigenous people\u2019s groups have three criteria for designating a community as indigenous: self-identification as indigenous, the indigenous heritage of the locality and communal management of local land. Several of the common surnames in Rio Blanco are Kichwa, allowing the villagers to self-identify as indigenous. And records in a nearby church proved that Kichwa people had lived here in the past. This allowed the villagers to found their own indigenous group, to make use of FPIC rights and take Junefield to court. On July 23, 2018, Rio Blanco joined the FOA. That year opposition to the mine by local communities also gained support from anti-mining and environmental activists from other cities. The Rio Blanco mine lies close to the environmentally vulnerable Cajas National Park and important water sources for Cuenca and other nearby cities. Environmental groups have always objected to the mine\u2019s plans to use almost 1,000 litres of water per hour. The conflict came to a head in May 2018. Protestors invaded the mine, damaging roads and burning camps. The government dispatched hundreds of police and soldiers in response. Meanwhile, Yaku Sacha lodged a case in the provincial court bought by the villagers of Rio Blanco and other nearby villages against the mining and environmental authorities. On June 5, judge Paul Serrano found that there had been no prior consultation with local communities, as required under the constitution and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and ordered a temporary halt on all mine activity. On August 3, the court rejected a company appeal attempting to restart operations. This was the first time a court in Ecuador had found in favour of indigenous communities because of foreign mining firms failing to carry out prior consultation, and the precedent encouraged others. A similar lawsuit against the Chinese-funded Mirador copper mine is underway, with the plaintiffs referring to the Rio Blanco decision in their case. An unlikely candidate Yaku Sacha used to be known as Carlos Ranulfo. He changed his name in 2017. His new moniker\u00a0is Kichwa for \u201cthe water which flows from the mountain\u201d. In March 2019 posters and stickers of him appeared all over Cuenca. Elizabeth Durazno had one on the window of her car, and there was one by the roadblock in San Pedro de Yumate. Local elections were to be held on March 24 and as candidate for the local indigenous party, Pachakutik, he sought to become governor of Azuay, the province in which Cuenca is situated, under the title\u00a0\u201cThe protector of water.\u201d It is rare for indigenous people to stand for election in Ecuador, and even rarer for them to win. When we met Yaku Sacha there were still two weeks to the elections. He had tied his long hair back and was wearing a traditional Kichwa necklace, standing by a busy road handing out flyers to passing drivers. Many recognised him and were happy to take a flyer, while others waved him off. At dusk he headed back to his campaign headquarters \u2013 his law office. He showed no signs of fatigue\u00a0when we asked about the Rio Blanco case.\u00a0\u201cLegal action, social action and political action are complementary,\u201d he said. Yaku Sacha on the campaign trail (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) Having just turned 50, Yaku Sacha sees his role as \u201copposing capitalists and politicians\u201d. Rio Blanco\u00a0is just one of the lawsuits in which he has represented indigenous communities. He is sure Junefield and the other companies carried out no prior consultation: \u201cIt\u2019s their normal way of operating. They confuse prior consultation with normal social interaction.\u201d \u201cIdeally, those companies would hold talks with nearby communities before development starts, whether those communities are indigenous or not,\u201d he says. \u201cBut because there\u2019s an international treaty specifically for indigenous people in place, those lawsuits are more effective.\u201d He and the villagers also add environmental concerns to their opposition, describing themselves as protecting water resources, rather than opposing the mine. As far as the government is concerned, they\u2019re all just troublemakers. In September 2018, Fernando Benalcazar became vice-minister for mining at the Ministry of Energy and Non-renewable Resources. He was blunt in his dismissal of the villagers\u2019 \u201copposition\u201d, calling them\u00a0\u201ca small group with ulterior motives stirring up the situation.\u201d \u201cTen or so people want to decide for everyone in Ecuador, it makes no sense.\u201d Benalcazar has been a senior mining official for decades and is clearly unhappy with the government\u2019s defeat in court. He thinks community leaders in Rio Blanco are backed by illegal miners, or their own political ambitions. He thinks the rights of indigenous people are being misused by opportunists who want to bring lawsuits and says \u201cthe leaders aren\u2019t the indigenous people \u2026 the site belongs to the nation. There\u2019s simply no need for prior consultation.\u201d He also told us that the checkpoint which Elizabeth Durazno was angry about had been permitted by the national police. The checkpoint at San Pedro de Yumate (Image: Andr\u00e9s Berm\u00fadez Li\u00e9vano) The other checkpoint, built by the villagers of San Pedro de Yumate, has also been a flashpoint. The villagers have used it stop both Junefield vehicles and people from Cochapamba \u2013 most of whom support the mine. Manuel Mueveclea is from Cochapamba, and described the methods of San Pedro de Yumate\u00a0villagers as \u201cviolent and extreme, infringing on our basic rights.\u201d He says people passing the checkpoint are asked if they oppose the mine. If they answer no, they are told not to use that road. He complains his mother was once held there\u00a0from 6pm until 2am. Villagers of Rio Blanco and San Pedro de Yumate react fiercely when you mention Cochapamba. Yaku Sacha has received numerous death threats, and he and three others have been kidnapped and beaten near the mine. He recalls being told during the eight hours he was held to \u201creturn our job opportunities, return our company money.\u201d And while there\u2019s no proof, local people are sure mine-supporting villagers from Cochapamba are responsible. Families torn apart It has now been over a year since the historic court victory. In the opinion of Andres Durazno, the Rio Blanco fish farmer: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what the decision really means.\u201d Winning in court hasn\u2019t solved the daily problems of the villagers and the community is continuing to fragment. When we visited the village we spoke to about 20 villagers, the majority of whom opposed the mine. Yet many of their relations may support it. Families have been torn apart by arguments over the mine. Elizabeth Durazno enjoys her new indigenous identity and often asks Yaku Sacha to teach her a few lines of Kichwa. She liked sitting down in court as equals with the mining company even more, and laughs as she remembers the scene: \u201cThe company thought they\u2019d get rid of us easily.\u201d The victory has turned Rio Blanco into a model for other communities, with visitors often coming to ask for advice, or villagers travelling to \u201ctell our story.\u201d The villagers\u2019 case focused on water resources, turning the essential liquid\u00a0into the most important topic in local politics. Yaku Sacha was victorious in\u00a0the March local elections and was elected as provincial governor. As Azuay is a major mining province, the arrival of a governor elected on his support for indigenous rights and the environment is bound to mean tensions continue.

Updated: October 15, 2021 @ 5:16 pm Tracking Covid-19 in and around Delaware  The latest on Restore the Corridor  Businesses in Delaware are hiring!  United States Senator Chris Coons On Friday, U.S. Sen. Tom Carper led an\u00a0Environment and Publi\u2026 Charges of official misconduct against an Amtrak police offi\u2026  Sports Director United States Senator Chris Coons Friday evening was a tenuous time in Washington as Democrats were locked in an internal struggle with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin over details of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan. Despite that, one of the lead negotiators, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, paused for a scheduled town hall on one of his favorite issues. \"We have been at an impasse now for three hours and I just got off the phone with the White House, and with the relevant impassing senator, and everybody is mad at everybody, and nobody has a path forward, so I thought I'd take a break and talk with you about global health.\" Coons, the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations [SFOPS] took part in the town hall organized by the Fund for Global Health. Delaware's junior senator spent a semester while at Amherst College studying at Kenya's University of Nairobi. He later returned to Africa in 1987 to work with the South African Council of Churches in the anti-apartheid movement. He told the group those experiences created \"a passion of mine.\" \"I got to see the impact of treatable and preventable diseases like malaria, tuberculous, diarrhea, and nutritional challenges on children and people of all ages in the developing world. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tragic impact. Here in the United States where we've lost 500,000 Americans in a pandemic that was far worse than it ever needed to be,\u00a0 but also particularly in the developing world. We were making study progress on the UN's developmental goals and we've seen nearly a decade of progress in improving public health and combatting poverty undone by COVID-19. One of the things that President Biden committed to as a candidate that excited me was to rejoin the World Health Organization, to join COVAX, to commit billions of dollars to make sure the world is vaccinated, because this pandemic is only going to end when it ends globally.\" Coons said the United States' commitment to helping health care around the world can pay off beyond just a healthier global community. \"Public health is one of the most important aspects of our engagement in the world. I've been to 30 countries in Africa during my decade as a senator. In every single one of them, it is our public health work combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic that makes for the biggest impact. Both in terms of human well-being and in terms of how other nations view the United States. We are viewed not as the colonial power, not as China, but as a genuine partner in meeting the real human needs of people in the developing world, and in particular the continent I know best.\" Coons said COVID isn't the only pandemic that is spreading in Africa, and creates the urgent need to help less-wealthy countries get back healthy. \"That there is a renewed Ebola outbreak in west Africa is tragic. It shows that we have to continue to invest in public health, in public health infrastructure, in training nurses, community health workers, and in funding the testing laboratories and the systems necessary for robust public health around the world.\" Coons said that while Ebola has not become a major problem in the United States, COVID-19 certainly has, and even if things stabilize in America, that doesn't mean the world, and therefore the U.S., is safely out of the woods. \"This is truly a pure example of a global challenge. Like climate change, where the United States cannot wall itself off from the rest of the world. Variants that develop in the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa, or in New York may end up being able to work around the vaccines we've already developed. We're in a race against time, and we have to vaccine as many Americans, and as many global citizens as we possibly can.\" Coons said his interest in Africa and global health can be difficult to explain, especially to those who believe the United States should strictly care about domestic issues. \"It is, at times, challenging to explain to the average Delawarean why I put a priority on time and investment in engagement around the world. This pandemic, tragically, creates that opportunity for us to reflect on the fact that we're not all safe and healthy until we are all safe and healthy. We are truly part of a global community. While there are some Americans who don't like that, don't recognize that, or don't embrace that, a pandemic doesn't care what you think of it, it's just going to keep hurting people until we get the whole world healthier and safer.\" SFOPS has a budget of over $55 billion to fund U.S. diplomacy, national security, global health, and life-saving humanitarian campaigns globally. Coons has also served as Chairman of the African Affairs and Global Health Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2011 to 2015.

            "text": " Months after the 2020 election, lawmakers are considering a slew of election-related proposals. Marvin Eng places his\u00a0ballot inside a ballot drop-off box outside of New Holly Gathering Hall in the Rainier Valley neighborhood of Seattle, Nov. 6, 2018. (Matt M. McKnight/Crosscut) The 2020 election ended months ago, but politicians in Olympia haven\u2019t lost interest in one of their favorite topics: election reform. Proposals on the legislative agenda this year range across the spectrum, from ranked-choice voting to a proposal to go back to in-person voting. Whether any of these proposals will make it to the governor\u2019s desk is unknown, but the sheer breadth and depth of this year\u2019s election reform bills are\u00a0impressive. Rep. Kirsten Harris-Talley, D-Seattle, has put ranked-choice voting on the horizon for local elections\u00a0with House Bill 1156. Ranked choice\u00a0is a method that allows voters to do just that: rank their choices in order of preference. HB 1156 would allow localities to decide for which, if any, local elections they will implement ranked-choice voting. Then they would either skip the primary or hold one to narrow a race\u00a0to five candidates. After the election, all first choice votes are counted. If a candidate has over 50% of the vote, that candidate wins.\u00a0If no candidate meets that threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters whose first choice is eliminated will have their votes count toward their second choice candidate. The process continues until a candidate has\u00a0over 50% of the vote. According to Michael Fertakis, a principal at Upper Left Strategies, ranked-choice voting helps mitigate what is known as the \u201cspoiler effect,\u201d when two candidates appeal to the same base, thus splitting the vote and allowing a third, potentially less popular candidate, to win. Because of this, Fertakis says, the system could help unconventional candidates. Fertakis points to the 2017 Seattle mayoral election. In the primary, current Mayor Jenny Durkan claimed the top spot and activist Cary Moon barely edged out the third-place candidate, Nikkita Oliver. That meant Durkan and Moon won\u00a0the top-two primary. Because Moon and Oliver shared the progressive vote, Fertakis believes ranked-choice voting could have changed the results of that election. One person testifying on the bill at a Feb. 8 public hearing before the House State Government & Tribal Relations Committee called for the election reform proposal to go even further. Andrew Hong of South Seattle worked on Sarah Smith\u2019s congressional bid in 2018, Tammy Morales\u2019\u00a0run for Seattle City Council in 2019\u00a0and as a student organizer for Bernie Sanders\u2019\u00a02020 presidential campaign \u2014 all before he was of voting age. \u201cI was giving so much and I couldn\u2019t even vote,\u201d Hong said of his experience in campaigns before his recent 18th birthday. \u201cAdults can just vote, but [to effect change] youth have to phone bank, canvas, do much more than check a box.\u201d Hong, who most recently campaigned for Harris-Talley, told the committee what he and Harris-Talley\u2019s campaign\u2019s youth team believe is the next step: youth voting rights. \u201cWe are really pushing for the conversation to center 16- and 17-year olds in our local elections\u00a0... ,\u201d he said in his testimony. \u201cYouth in many ways are already treated as adults \u2014\u00a0we pay taxes, we have jobs, we go to jail.\u201d According to Hong, his seemingly tangential testimony paid off: Harris-Talley will be working with the youth team to draft policy related to youth voting rights in the interim. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a booster of other election reforms, including youth registration and vote by mail, doesn\u2019t support ranked-choice voting, according to Jay Jennings, her legislative director. He said\u00a0Wyman would prefer to focus on shoring up the existing voting system rather than going in a new direction that could further polarize voters. \u201cAs we collectively reflect on the toxic, misinformed and dangerous reactions following the 2020 election, civility, broad knowledge and excess of voter confidence do not come quickly to mind,\u201d Jennings told the committee on behalf of Wyman. With an electorate Jennings describes as \u201cskeptical\u201d and \u201cpolarized,\u201d Wyman is more keen to regain voter trust without the addition of a new system that could possibly stoke existing flames. Another election law proposal before the Legislature this year takes the debate in an entirely different direction, one that could be equally polarizing: a rollback of Washington\u2019s vote-by-mail system. State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, asserted that his proposal in Senate Bill 5143 is needed\u00a0because of widespread fraud in the 2020 election \u2014 a claim not \u00a0supported by any evidence and which his fellow Republican,\u00a0Wyman, flatly denies. Ericksen says the Free and Fair Elections Act would \u201crestore integrity\u201d in the state\u2019s elections by eliminating mail-in ballots for a return to in-person polling with valid voter ID. The bill would allow for absentee ballots upon request, early voting\u00a0and would make Election Day a state holiday. In the House, Rep. Brad Klippert, R-Kennewick, is sponsoring a whole slew of bills\u00a0related to election security. After pouring over the state\u2019s election laws for days, Klippert\u00a0 \u2014 who has never put a ballot directly into a mailbox \u2014 filed House Bills 1003, 1360, and 1361 to reform the existing mail-in ballot system and HB\u00a01377 to abolish it altogether. \u201cI gave the majority two options: Do away with mail-in ballots or make it more secure,\u201d Klippert said. \u201cAnd unfortunately they didn\u2019t select either one.\u201d Klippert does not support ranked-choice voting as he believes it \u201cmuddies the water.\u201d Ericksen said that system would be \u201ccompletely and absolutely\u201d incompatible with his proposal. \u201c[Ranked choice] is just another mechanism by the left to try to further dilute votes, further complicate the system, and move us further away from transparency,\u201d Ericksen said. Not all Republicans think\u00a0this way. Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, is the lone Republican co-sponsor of the ranked-choice voting bill along with 26 House Democrats. Walsh saw no reason that a Republican should not support ranked-choice voting. As someone who shares some concerns over election security, Walsh does not see ranked choice to be any less secure than the current system. To him, the impulses to expand democracy and keep elections secure are not mutually exclusive. He calls the proposed reform \u201cquirky,\u201d yet \u201cpolitically neutral.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s all these theories about what it will do: It\u2019ll reward centrist candidates or it\u2019ll reward radical candidates,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will do any of that. Hypothetically, the person it benefits the most is the slightly nontraditional, slightly underfunded candidate with a compelling message.\u201d Walsh joked\u00a0that Republicans will have trouble getting elected under any system in Washington \u2014 \u201cno [greater trouble] under ranked-choice voting.\u201d\u00a0 Although Walsh has not polled his caucus yet, he anticipates House Republicans will give ranked-choice voting slightly more nays than yeas. \u201cI think some folks are scared of change just because they're scared of change,\u201d Harris-Talley\u00a0said. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve always seen is that through change we have found ways to make our systems better, more efficient, more accessible. That\u2019s what a healthy democracy does.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled state Rep. Kirsten Harris-Talley's name. This story has been corrected. Seattle mayoral candidates debate business and economic issues tonight; they will focus on health and public safety on Oct. 28.

Su aporte al sistema nacional interconectado de energ\u00eda ser\u00e1 de 270 megavatios. En el evento, el ministro de Energ\u00eda y Recursos Naturales No Renovables, Carlos P\u00e9rez Garc\u00eda, ratific\u00f3 que el Estado concesionar\u00e1 a una empresa privada la administraci\u00f3n de varios proyectos el\u00e9ctricos o de hidrocarburos, pero ratific\u00f3 que no se los vender\u00e1 o privatizar\u00e1.

Previo a la inauguraci\u00f3n de la obra el Ministro de Electricidad recorri\u00f3, junto a las autoridades del proyecto, la casa de m\u00e1quinas, la central de monitoreo, las turbinas y otros componentes. Publicidad Durante una parada realizada por la maqueta el Ministro se enter\u00f3 que este proyecto inici\u00f3 en 2012 y deb\u00eda terminar en el 2016 lo que gener\u00f3 un costo adicional del ocho por ciento del costo original que era de $ 480 millones. Esto significa cerca de siete millones de d\u00f3lares. Tanto las obras f\u00edsicas como mec\u00e1nicas est\u00e1n listas en las diferentes zonas del proyecto como el embalse, t\u00faneles, casa de m\u00e1quinas, etc. Energ\u00eda limpia Seg\u00fan el ministro Carlos P\u00e9rez esta obra constituye una fuente de energ\u00eda limpia y tras superar una etapa de operaci\u00f3n experimental que inici\u00f3 en noviembre pasado est\u00e1 lista para su operaci\u00f3n Durante su discurso asever\u00f3 que esta obra beneficia a 222.000 habitantes de la zona de influencia con proyectos sociales, productivos y mejorando la calidad de vida con la implementaci\u00f3n de servicios b\u00e1sicos como energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica o agua potable.

            "text": " Discover Thomson Reuters More By Marco Aquino 2 Min Read LIMA (Reuters) - A consortium led by China Three Gorges Corp [CYTGP.UL] has agreed to buy a hydroelectric plant in Peru from scandal-plagued Brazilian builder Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] for $1.39 billion, a person with knowledge of the deal said on Thursday. Odebrecht earlier in the day said it had signed a deal to sell its 456 megawatt Chaglla plant in northern Peru to the consortium. It declined to comment on price. The deal marks China Three Gorges\u2019 first venture into Peru as the presence of Chinese companies grows in Latin America. The consortium also includes China's Hubei Energy Group Co Ltd 000883.SZ, which on Thursday said it would buy 40 percent of the Odebrecht subsidiary that owns Chaglla for $277 million. Hubei and China Three Gorges, one of the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric power producers, could not be reached for comment. Odebrecht is at the center of Latin America\u2019s biggest graft scandal having admitted to paying bribes from Peru to Panama. It is trying to shrink its debt as it faces over $2.6 billion in fines and bans on bidding for government contracts in Peru and Argentina. It said Peru\u2019s justice ministry and Chinese regulators must approve the latest deal before it can be finalized. The pending sale of another Odebrecht asset in Peru, its Olmos irrigation business, was blocked by the court following a petition from a special attorney who has since been dismissed. Odebrecht told Reuters this month that it did not expect the sale of other Peru assets to be blocked as earnings generated would help it pay Peru reparations for bribery.

The $450 million project, jointly owned by Pacific Hydro and Astaldi, was conceived to provide 300,000 homes with clean energy. In addition to offering sustainable solutions in an ecologically diverse area, Chacayes effectively reduces the dependence on fossil fuels and eliminates 340,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution each year. Chacayes channels the natural flow of the Cachapoal River, utilizing low-height intake tunnels that minimize environmental impacts and eliminate the need for large reservoirs. The scope of Chacayes required our team to enlist several environmental and social initiatives that promote community partnerships, support environmental preservation, and align with the Kyoto Protocol. \u00a0 Inaugurated in 2011, Chacayes is the first in a series of five run-of-river hydroelectric projects being developed to add more than 600 MW of renewable energy capacity to Chile\u2019s national grid. Our team was more than honored to win the Environmental Initiative of the Year Award in 2011. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPella, Iowa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome, Georgia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMission, British Columbia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConcordia, Entre Rios, Argentina\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKentucky and West Virginia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVictoria Nile River, Uganda\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlto Cachapoal Valley, Chile\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCampbellford, Onrtario\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCumberland River, Kentucky\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndus River, Pakistan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGualaca District, Panama\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenale-Dawa River Basin, Ethiopia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrand Coulee, Washington\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrand Coulee, Washington\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoulder, Colorado\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAzad Jammu and Kashmir, Kotli District, Pakistan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKarahnjukar, Iceland\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPakistan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLake Chelan, Washington\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLos Caracoles, Argentina\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeballos Lake, British Columbia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVitu Levu, Fiji\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMuzaffarabad, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAJK, Pakistan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPella, Iowa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome, Georgia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMission, British Columbia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConcordia, Entre Rios, Argentina\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKentucky and West Virginia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVictoria Nile River, Uganda\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlto Cachapoal Valley, Chile\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCampbellford, Onrtario\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Partner with us today to change how tomorrow looks.

File \u00a0   A 47-year-old Army officer arrested in connection with a recruitment exam paper leak in Pune was on Monday remanded to police custody till March 15. The Pune police told the court of Additional Sessions Judge S.R. Navandar that Major T. Murugan, who was arrested from Tamil Nadu, had forwarded the question paper to other accused. Public Prosecutor Premkumar Agrawal told court that Murugan had forwarded the leaked question paper to other accused through Whatsapp, and the police needed to know from where he got this exam paper. Mr. Agrawal said the accused had deleted mobile phone chats, which had to be retrieved, and a probe was needed to unearth financial transactions and further links. Also read: Army cancels recruitment exam after question paper leak Defence counsel A.D. Lonandkar opposed the plea and told court that the accused\u2019s phone had already been seized and, therefore, there was no need for police custody. Remanding Murugan to police custody till March 15, Judge Navandar said the accused is the key person in the paper leak conspiracy. \u201cDue to unlawful activities, the entire process of recruitment was stopped and the exam postponed. Considering the seriousness of the crime, there is a need for thorough investigation and for that sufficient police custody is required,\u201d the judge observed.

            "text": " The 2020 presidential election is over and done with, but Kanye West's presidential campaign is still facing scrutiny and possible legal action from the Federal Elections Commission for alleged improprieties. On March 5, The Daily Beast published an investigative report into West's Birthday Party Campaign, which has been reportedly eyed by the FEC for an abnormal number of complaints. \u201cIn five-plus years of doing this I\u2019ve never come across something like this,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for government watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, about \u2019Ye's campaign. Jennifer Bloom, mother of 16-year-old donor Ian Bloom, called West's campaign \"a scam.\" Her son purchased $3,280 worth of Kanye 2020 merch with hopes of making a sizeable flip on the secondary market. He reportedly has not received a single item he purchased. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening there,\u201d Ian Bloom said. \u201cI ordered like 20 hoodies off his campaign website, along with a lot of other people that I know. They said it would be three weeks, and after that I emailed the support team, and the email just wasn\u2019t a thing.\u201d He is still trying to dispute the charges with his credit card company. There is also the issue of accepting campaign donations from minors, which is illegal. Students reportedly account for upwards of 1,200 of the West campaign\u2019s 3,161 donations, with the contributing total being $349,160. \u201cI can say with confidence that at least half of us in the group have to be still in high school,\u201d Bloom added. Two other minors came forward, including 15-year-old Andres Zapata, who claimed he donated $1,300 in January but has yet to receive his items. Merch is no longer available on Kanye's campaign site. XXL has reached out to Kanye West's publicists and presidential campaign for comment. Kanye confirmed last July that he was running for president in 2020, getting a late start on his already unfathomable run to become the POTUS. Things were shaky from the start with Kanye reportedly hiring and firing a 180-person campaign staff within a week of announcing his run. After reigniting his campaign in September of last year, he reportedly asked the unwed people on his staff to abstain from having sex. The rapper-aspiring politician struggled to get on ballots in several states and was even removed from the ballot in Illinois after it was discovered that 1,900 of the signatures his campaign allegedly obtained were invalid, prompting some to believe the FEC would launch an investigation into voter fraud. Kanye raised $2 million from contributions from individuals and spent $12.4 million of his own money on his campaign, according to FEC data. He was strangely confident about his chances of winning. However, he only secured 60,000 total votes.

            "text": " Arecent poll revealed that a surprisingly large chunk of Barcelona's club members believe that Lionel Messi is dispensable. It was revealed in a recent survey by Spanish network TV3 that a whopping 30% of club members believe that they can move forward without the first team captain once his contract expires in June. Despite this revelation, Joan Laporta still won the election for club president on Sunday, after he had used his intention to convince Messi to stay as his main battle cry. Marca reports that the TV3 poll asked members about who they voted for and their opinion on the Messi contract extension. Only 65.7 percent of respondents believed that it was absolutely essential to convince Messi to stay at the Camp Nou. Meanwhile, 30.7 percent are ready to move on to a new era at Barcelona. Lionel Messi himself felt strongly about making changes at the club, so much so that he was spotted casting a vote himself. He arrived at the Camp Nou with his son Thiago shortly before noon, and was greeted by cheering club members who were there to cast votes themselves. ? The captain of the first team, Leo Messi, exercises his right to vote at the Camp Nou ? pic.twitter.com/oiPVRcQHtl Fellow first team players Sergio Busquets, Riqui Puig, Sergi Roberto and Jordi Alba were also spotted exercising their right to vote. It is expected that the wheels will soon start turning on Messi's contract renewal. Joan Laporta should be making an offer, and it remains to be seen if recent changes and the new offer will convince the Argentine superstar to stay. More than half of the club members also think that the renovations at the stadium should be fast-tracked by having the team play at an alternate venue. This strategy has been proven effective by rivals Real Madrid, who have been playing at the Alfredo di Stefano stadium in Valdebebas for the past year. This has helped them speed up the work at the Santiago Bernabeu.  \u201cClosing the gap between the promise of AI and its implementation"

Recently the Downtown Cadillac Association sent out a press release detailing their plans to host the promotional tour of the Back to the Bricks-Flint organization on June 7. CADILLAC \u2014 The Downtown Cadillac Association is taking steps to bring the Back to the Bricks classic car show back to Cadillac, at least for one year. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-time deal,\u2018 said Tereesa Arn, owner of Horizon Books and member of the DCA board. Recently the DCA sent out a press release detailing their plans to host the promotional tour of the Back to the Bricks-Flint organization on June 7. \u201cMitchell Street will be closed from 4-8 p.m. as we\u2019re anticipating well over 200 cars,\u2018 the press release states. \u201cThe car show will be from 5-8 p.m. and be on Mitchell, Mason and Harris streets. We\u2019ve made an application to the city to do this.\u2018 For a number of years, Cadillac hosted Back to the Bricks in the downtown area, which was closed for traffic for the duration of the event; hundreds of people from around the area turned out to check out the collection of classic cars and other attractions. A couple of years ago, the DCA ended their licensing agreement with Back to the Bricks and began hosting the Cadillac Lakes Car Show and Cruise, instead. Arn said the decision to no longer host Back to the Bricks was in part to give the DCA and city more freedom to do other things with the car show besides those strictly stipulated by the national Back to the Bricks organization. Despite no longer having a long-term agreement in place, Arn said Back to the Bricks contacted the DCA and asked if they could swing by Cadillac during their annual promotional tour through Northern Michigan. Arn said the board thought it was a good idea, since the Back to the Bricks tour could be the perfect precursor for the Cadillac Lakes Car Show and Cruise. With the departure of longtime DCA executive director Joy VanDrie, however, Arn said they decided not to host the Cadillac Lakes Car Show and Cruise this year, since they were unsure how much planning and preparation is involved in putting it on. She said they hope to bring that event back next year. While the Back to the Bricks promotional tour will be held in Cadillac on a Monday, which isn\u2019t ideal for shutting down main street, Arn said it\u2019s good in other ways, such as bringing visitors to the city on a day when they wouldn\u2019t normally be here. \u201cThis will be huge for restaurants and other downtown businesses,\u2018 Arn said. \u201cThe hope is that downtown businesses see this as an opportunity for an uptick in business during this event and they will stay open until 7 or 8 p.m., as the car show participants will be a captive audience,\u2018 reads the DCA press release. During the event, there will be food vendors in the park and a DJ at Harris and Mitchell streets. There will be two local food vendors, Chico\u2019s Taco House and Primo\u2019s BBQ. \u201cWe plan on lining the cars up starting at Cass and working northward,\u2018 The DCA press release states. \u201cWe\u2019ll be permitted from Cass to Bremer streets. The car show participants will be staying the night on Monday.\u2018 If local car people want to get in on the show, they will need to register through the Back to the Bricks website, backtothebricks.org. The DCA press release states that the Flint group will be providing window posters and counter stands early in May as promotional material; these materials will be distributed to merchants. Arn said while they are taking the steps now to facilitate the promotional tour\u2019s stop in Cadillac, the ultimate decision on whether or not the tour will be held this year will be made on May 1 by Back to the Bricks. She said this decision will be made based on COVID-19 conditions and gathering restrictions. Cadillac News Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

            "text": " Voice of America08 Mar 2021, 19:05 GMT+10 Pope Francis departed Iraq on Monday after a four-day visit to the country that included meetings with Christians and Muslim leaders as he preached a message of coexistence. Iraqi President Barham Salih was among those at the airport in Baghdad for a farewell ceremony Monday. On Sunday, the pope visited Mosul, once a stronghold of the Islamic State militant group, where he prayed for Iraq's war victims in a city square. Francis also traveled to Qaraqosh, an ancient Christian town that had been overrun by Islamic State forces. The pope met with members of the local community at the Church of the Immaculate Conception. He also celebrated an open-air Mass on Sunday at the Franso Hariri stadium in Irbil. Because of COVID-19 restrictions, attendance was limited to 10,000 people. On Saturday, the 84-year-old pope met with the reclusive Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani at the 90-year-old Muslim leader's modest home in Najaf. Sistani is one of the most important figures in Shiite Islam and wields considerable influence in Iraq and beyond. The Christian presence in Iraq dates to the first centuries of the religion, but only a few hundred thousand Christians remain today. The visit to Iraq was the pope's 33rd trip outside Italy and his first in the last 15 months, due mostly to the coronavirus pandemic. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet a daily dose of Iraq Sun news\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tup to date with world and business news as well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPublish news of your business, community or sports group,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpersonnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnews release to Iraq Sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  BOSTON, Massachusetts: Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker has announced that he is deploying up to 200 National Guard members to assist ...

            "text": " The first phase of the advanced Dominica-China friendship hospital was inaugurated today. The construction of the hospital was started in the year 2015 and today the first phase is ready to use. The ribbon cutting ceremony of the event had the presence of the President of the Commonwealth of Dominica Charles Savarin, Prime Minister Dr. Roosevelt Skerrit, Melissa Skerrit and Chinese ambassadors as well as senior engineers. Not only that, the leader of opposition Lennox Linton also made his presence for the event. Even though it was an extremely hot day, people of Dominica also made their presence in the historic day for Dominica. The hospital is equipped with advanced technology and facilities capable to treat the major diseases. Besides this, the Dominica-China hospital will facilitate people older than 60 years and children below the age of 18 with free medical facilities. During his speech, Prime Minister Dr. Roosevelt Skerrit acknowledged the presence of all the officials as well as the leader of the opposition.  Prime Minister said that it is the matter of proud for the Commonwealth of Dominica that the country now has advanced health care facilities here in our homeland, now nobody has to take a ferry or liat (Airline) to visit other islands to get an MRI done because the modern hospital is equipped with the finest machines. PM also thanked the dignitaries and the People\u2019s Republic of China, he said \u201cThanks to the longstanding and faithful friendship between the governments of People\u2019s Republic of China and Dominica that citizens of Dominica have a new state of the art health facility to be proud of here in our country.\u201d Prime Minister discussed the features of the hospitals; he said that this quality of healthcare is first in Dominica. The new accident and emergency building have one operation theatre, 14 observation beds, 4 doctors\u2019 clinic, and two isolations rooms among many modern facilities.\u00a0 The hospital is also said to have the largest dialysis unit in the country along with an advanced blood bank and lab. Prime Minister said, \u201cWe will soon complete hotels and houses complexes which will provide the best hotels and public health in the entire English speaking Caribbean.\u201d Skerrit said that the second phase of the hospital will be completed soon and it will also have a helipad just in case any patient needs to fly to other countries for some health care then the helicopter will come here instead of going to the Douglas Charles Airport. \u201cWhen our grandchildren will read about a Dominica in the year 2020 they will read about a Dominica which had the best roads networks, best health care services, and modern infrastructure in the whole English speaking the Caribbean which is a thing of proud,\u201d said Skerrit. H.E. Lu Kun Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China during his speech said \u201cIt gives me enormous pleasure and honour to attend today\u2019s handover and opening ceremony of new Dominica-China hospital. On behalf of the Chinese government, I would like to extend my warm congratulations and sincere regards at this moment to the government of Dominica as today is a special day for the Dominican medical history.\u201d Mr. Lu Kun said that more than 500 Chinese aid projects are currently going on in 120 countries across the world. The Chinese ambassador expressed that this hospital project was most challenging for them as they had to construct a new building, while a number of patients were being treated at the same time. \u201cThe quality and structure of this hospital is very very strong as it is hurricane-proof. The Chinese government is actively supportive to the call of Dr Roosevelt Skerrit to build a climate-resilient nation, so we changed the design and replaced all the old roofs with concrete roofs, this is for the safety of every doctor, nurse and patient at the hospital. In future serious patients will not have to travel to other islands for treatment, yet in fact patients will travel to Dominica to get better treatment,\u201d he added. Divulging the details of the Hospital, Dr. Kenneth Darroux Minister for Health and Social Services said that two aesthetically pleasing buildings are built to provide accident and emergency services and a radiology department, complete with modern state of the art imaging equipment.

La obra ha tenido tres procesos fallidos desde 2018. La \u00faltima este 2020, cuando el proyecto se adjudic\u00f3, por USD 16,4 millones, al Consorcio Pedernales Manab\u00ed, cuyos principales representantes est\u00e1n detenidos como parte de una trama de corrupci\u00f3n que implica a dos exasamble\u00edstas (Daniel Mendoza y Eliseo Azuero).  Los alcaldes de Manab\u00ed han amenazado con una movilizaci\u00f3n la primera semana de octubre de 2020, para exigir la obra. El monto del cr\u00e9dito gestionado con el China Development Bank (el Banco de Desarrollo de la Rep\u00fablica Popular de China) es por el costo del hospital b\u00e1sico de 30 camas, es decir, USD 16,4 millones.  Esa fue la gesti\u00f3n del MTOP, cuyo titular, el ministro Gabriel Mart\u00ednez Castro, se ha visto en apuros y este 1 de octubre de 2020 llegar\u00e1 a Pedernales para anunciar la decisi\u00f3n del cr\u00e9dito con China.  De los 8,2 millones (50% de anticipo) que el Servicio de Contrataci\u00f3n de Obras (Secob) entreg\u00f3 al Consorcio Pedernales Manab\u00ed en marzo de 2020, el Estado no ha logrado recuperar ni un centavo: la constructora no devolvi\u00f3 nada y tampoco se pudo ejecutar la garant\u00eda de buen uso del anticipo porque Seguros Confianza S.A. gan\u00f3 una acci\u00f3n de protecci\u00f3n.  De hecho, la Sala Especializada de lo Civil de la Corte Provincial de Justicia del Guayas ratific\u00f3 el 30 de septiembre de 2020 la medida a favor de la aseguradora. Este es un fallo de \u00faltima instancia.  Por eso el apuro del Gobierno: el caso Pedernales devel\u00f3 una estructura criminal para delinquir que salpica a funcionarios, pol\u00edticos, empresas p\u00fablicas y privadas, entre ellas el Servicio de Contrataci\u00f3n de Obras  y hasta la Agencia Nacional de Tr\u00e1nsito (ANT).   Por ello, hasta ahora hay dos causas penales. Uno en Manab\u00ed por lavado de activos (13 procesados). Y el m\u00e1s importante en Quito, por delincuencia organizada (20 implicados).  El Consorcio Pedernales comenz\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n del hospital en mayo de 2020, en plena pandemia. No avanz\u00f3 ni el 2%: el 14 de mayo la Fiscal\u00eda inici\u00f3 los operativos para desmantelar la estructura criminal. Hasta el momento hay 20 personas detenidas.  \nEl 18 de agosto de 2020, habitantes de la zona norte de Manab\u00ed reclamaron por la construcci\u00f3n de los hospitales de Pedernales y Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez.\u00a0El Diario  Pedir el cr\u00e9dito al China Development Bank era el plan B. Esto, seg\u00fan el MTOP, por una exigencia del Gobierno de ese pa\u00eds: que la constructora que se contrate para la obra sea china. Ese fue el mecanismo usado, por ejemplo, para el hospital de Chone y otras obras en Ecuador.  Al ser as\u00ed, queda fuera de juego el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ej\u00e9rcito, al que el MTOP hab\u00eda adjudicado en julio de 2020 la obra de forma directa.  El Ministro Mart\u00ednez asegura que la primera opci\u00f3n siempre fue ejecutar la p\u00f3liza del buen uso del anticipo. Pero en todas las instancias la justicia fall\u00f3 a favor de la aseguradora Confianza.  En el camino surgi\u00f3 otra opci\u00f3n: pedir a la jueza de Portoviejo Mariana Palomeque que disponga descongelar los fondos que est\u00e1n en dos cuentas a nombre del Consorcio Pedernales (ver gr\u00e1fico).  Esta jueza est\u00e1 a cargo del proceso de lavado de activos que se sigue contra 13 personas de la trama de corrupci\u00f3n a las que se les encontr\u00f3 dinero en efectivo, entre ellas a Jean Carlos Benavides, asesor del exasamble\u00edsta Mendoza.  Seg\u00fan el MTOP, \u201cesos valores, en lugar de permanecer retenidos, deben ser transferidos o entregados a la Cuenta \u00danica del Tesoro Nacional por cuanto son fondos de propiedad del Estado, para que el proyecto de construcci\u00f3n del hospital de Pedernales pueda continuar\u201d.  Sin embargo, el 30 de septiembre de 2020, a las 15:00, hubo otro rev\u00e9s para el Gobierno: la jueza de Portoviejo neg\u00f3 el pedido. Resolvi\u00f3 que ese dinero pase a una cuenta de Inmobiliar como custodia hasta que se resuelva el proceso. Es decir, esos USD 5,8 millones del saldo del anticipo, que est\u00e1n retenidos en el Banco Internacional y BanEcuador, no se podr\u00e1n usar todav\u00eda para el hospital de Pedernales. Es dinero en el aire.  \nEl viceministro de Salud, Ernesto Carrasco, recorri\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n del Hospital de Pedernales junto a representantes del Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ej\u00e9rcito el 16 de junio de 2020.\u00a0MSP  El hospital b\u00e1sico de Pedernales se levantar\u00e1 en un terreno de 31.658 metros cuadrados y tendr\u00e1 las siguientes \u00e1reas, como establece el proyecto aprobado por el Servicio de Contrataci\u00f3n de Obras (Sebob).  En planta baja:   En planta alta:  El de Pedernales sigue siendo, entonces, un hospital en papeles.  Pol\u00edtica Lasso: \u201cLa muerte cruzada es una salida dr\u00e1stica, que probablemente sea inevitable\u201d El presidente, Guillermo Lasso, anunci\u00f3 que el Gobierno enviar\u00e1 dos reformas econ\u00f3micas con el car\u00e1cter de urgente en materia econ\u00f3mica.

MEGHAN Markle and Kate Middleton had a disagreement over flower girl dresses ahead of the Duchess of Sussex's big day in May 2018. But what was Kate and Meghan's row all about?  \ud83d\udc51 Read our Meghan and Harry live blog for the latest news... It was reported at the time that royal newbie Meghan had left Kate in tears over her demands for Princess Charlotte's bridesmaid dress.  Rumours of a rift between the duchesses swirled after royal sources revealed emotional Kate ended up weeping following a \u201cstressful\u201d dress fitting \u2014 just weeks before\u00a0Meghan married\u00a0Prince Harry in May 2018.  Charlotte had been trying on her outfit before the big day and Meghan is understood to have insisted on \u201cthe very best\u201d.  But the fitting reportedly did not go according to her demands. In 2020 it was claimed the rift was over whether bridesmaids should follow royal protocol by wearing tights,\u00a0which Meghan disagreed with. Speaking to\u00a0Tatler magazine, a pal said: \"It was a hot day and apparently there was a row over whether the bridesmaids should wear tights or not. \"Kate, following protocol, felt that they should. Meghan didn't want them to.\" But on March 8, a source claimed to the\u00a0The Telegraph\u00a0that the Duchesses fell out after\u00a0Charlotte's bridesmaid dress didn't fit - which meant they had to schedule more fittings ahead of the big day. Royal sources said the pressure of the \u201cstressful\u201d fitting became too much and that Kate was left shaken and in tears. An insider told The Telegraph: \u201cKate had only just given birth to her third child, Prince Louis, and was feeling quite \u00ademotional.\u201d But, in an explosive tell-all chat with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan revealed it was Kate that made HER cry just days before her wedding.  The\u00a0Duchess of Sussex\u00a0said there had been a confrontation between herself and the\u00a0Duchess of Cambridge\u00a0over bridesmaid dresses which left her in tears. When Oprah asked Meghan if it was true that she'd made Kate cry, the Duchess replied: \"No, no, the reverse happened. \"I don\u2019t say that to be disparaging to anyone. She was upset about something, she owned it, she brought me flowers and brought a note apologising. \"She did what I would do if I hurt someone.\" The Duchess said the confrontation had \"really hurt my feelings\" and was a \"turning point\" in their relationship, adding: \"I don't think it's fair to her to get into the details of that because she apologised and I've forgiven her. \"What was hard to get over was being blamed for something not only I did not do, but that happened to me.\" As well as Princess Charlotte, Meghan's goddaughters\u00a0Rylan and Remi Litt were chosen to be among her bridesmaids.   They are the daughters of one of Meghan's closed friends, Benita Litt.  There was also Prince Harry's goddaughter, Florence van Cutsem, who is the daughter of Major Nicholas and Alice van Cutsem. Ivy Mulroney, daughter of the bride's best friend Jessica Mulroney, was also a flower girl. And Zalie Warren, Harry's goddaughter and daughter of Zoe and Jake Warren, was the youngest of the bridesmaids.

            "text": " China splurges on cricket to snip Taiwan's Caribbean courtship \n More than 8,000 miles (12,800 km) from Beijing, Chinese workers are putting the finishing touches on stadiums for a sport they\u2019ve never played. \n\n\tLiving in temporary plastic huts and taking a single day off each month, about 1,000 employees of state-owned Chinese companies have sweated away the past year on the Caribbean islands of Jamaica, Antigua and Grenada as the West Indies prepare to host the cricket World Cup, the game\u2019s premier international event. \n\n\tTheir presence has more to do with China\u2019s drive to isolate Taiwan, the democracy it considers a breakaway province, than with what the Chinese call shen shi yun dong, or \u201cthe noble game.\" China is using its economic might to break alliances Taiwan forged in the Caribbean to counter its status as a diplomatic outcast. \n\n\t\u201cThis is a diplomatic move,\" says John Tkacik, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based research group. \u201cThere\u2019s no other reason for China to go horsing around in the Caribbean. The more countries that abandon recognition of Taiwan, the less international status it has.\" \n\n\tThe 2007 World Cup, a seven-week, 16-team tournament, opens on 13 March in Kingston, Jamaica. Organizers expect it to lure 1 lakh tourists and a television audience of 220 crore. China has contributed about $132 million (Rs585.4 crore) for facilities, tournament officials say. Hosting the event required cooperation among nine independent states. \n\n\t\u201cThey knew we didn\u2019t have the money,\" says Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the Chinese workers we wouldn\u2019t have been able to complete the stadium.\" \n\n\tChina, the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, is spreading its global influence by stepping up donations to developing countries. Aid is disbursed through China\u2019s commerce ministry, which says it doesn\u2019t disclose assistance figures. China hands out about $2.7 billion a year in Africa alone, up from $100 million a decade ago, according to an estimate from the US military\u2019s Washington-based National Defense University. \n\n\t\u201cChina is projecting her power internationally to win friends,\" says Clem Seecharan, professor of Caribbean history at London Metropolitan University. \u201cIt\u2019s a China that is feeding on a kind of magnanimity of helping the poor. That is the kind of image that China is projecting to counter the American image of a communist dictatorship.\" \n\n\tThe Caribbean has become a focal point for China because it contains four of the 24 states that still recognize Taiwan. Stepped-up Chinese investment has already persuaded two nations in the region to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Three years ago, Dominica ended its recognition of Taiwan and will receive $117 million of aid over six years. Grenada was won over after Hurricane Ivan in 2004, which damaged more than 90% of the homes on the island. China\u2019s offer of a $100 million building programme, including $40 million to replace a cricket stadium destroyed by the storm, helped prompt a change of allegiance the following year. \n\n\tTaiwan successfully sued Grenada in US district court in New York for the return of $20 million that a Taiwanese bank had loaned the government, partly to fund the stadium. \u201cThe big thorn in Taiwan\u2019s side is that they are suffering not just insult but injury,\" Tkacik says. \n\n\tControversy also surrounded the official handover of Grenada National Stadium in February. As the Chinese ambassador and scores of blue-uniformed labourers entered the arena, the Royal Grenadan Police Band greeted them with the Taiwanese national anthem, prompting an apology from Prime Minister Keith Mitchell. The opening of the $60 million Sir Vivian Richards cricket ground in Antigua on 10 February went smoothly.  \n\n\tChinese Ambassador Ren Xiaoping presented an oversized red key to Prime Minister Spencer at a ceremony honoring the 400 Chinese workers who toiled on the project. \u201cTheir sweat has soaked this land,\" said Ren, as fireworks exploded in the night sky. \u201cDuring the past year, five of these workers have lost their parents and seven became fathers for the first time. But none of them went home. Why? Because they knew their responsibilities.\" \n\n\tTaiwan split from China in 1949, when communists led by Mao Zedong took control of the mainland. The US initially sided with Taiwan, providing money and military supplies. In 1971, China replaced Taiwan as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Eight years later, the US recognized China and severed its ties with Taiwan. \n\n\tAntigua and Barbuda was the first Caribbean country to officially recognize China in 1983. \u201cWe moved from a situation where we were flirting with Taiwan to declaring our full support for the \u2018One China\u2019 policy,\" Spencer says. \n\n\tSince Grenada\u2019s defection, Taiwan has used the cricket tournament to help hang onto its Caribbean friends. Taiwan funded the $12 million Warner Park in St Kitts and Nevis, and a Taiwan construction company helped build facilities in St Vincent and the Grenadines. \n\n\tThe World Cup has accomplished what the UN couldn\u2019t: over the past few years the two diplomatic rivals have attended planning meetings as equals, says Chris Dehring, chief executive officer of the event. He says the tournament benefited from competition between the foes. Never miss a story!

Construction of the project began in May 2011 and operations commenced in 2016. The plant has an operational life of 30 years. It required a $1.2bn investment and produces approximately 2.8GW/h a year while offsetting approximately 467,000t of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere. In August 2017, Odebrecht Latinvest entered an agreement with a consortium led by the China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) to dispose of the Chaglla hydroelectric plant. The Chaglla hydroelectric project is located on the Huallaga River in the Chaglla district of Huanuco, Peru. It includes a concrete-face rock-filled dam, which impounds a 4.66km\u00b2 reservoir upstream of the dam, diversion tunnel and hydroelectric generation facilities, comprising a powerhouse, substation and transmission line. The\u00a0rock-filled dam has a maximum height of 202m and a crest length of approximately 273m, while the crest of the dam is located at an elevation of 1,202m above sea level and 11.2m-wide. The reservoir has an elevation of 1,196m and a water surface area of 4.5km\u00b2. It has a storage capacity of approximately 375 million cubic metres, and three tunnels with a total length of 2,850m were built on the left margin for spillway discharge. In addition, the plant features two turbine generators with a nominal output of 253MVA and frequency of 60Hz. These turbines have a nominal voltage of 13.8kV and operate at a synchronous speed of 900rpm. Water from the dam is diverted through a 14.7km intake tunnel to the main powerhouse, which is equipped with two Alstom power transformers with a nominal output of 225MW. The project also features a small powerhouse, including a power transformer with an output of 6MW. The substation is situated above the main powerhouse at an elevation between 900m to 925m. The power generated by the plant is transferred to the Peruvian national grid (Sistema Electrico Interconectado Nacional-SEIN) at the Paragsha substation, via a 137km-long, 220kV transmission line. Four sites were created for the construction phase. Major works include the construction of the concrete-face dam with a 466ha reservoir, a surface powerhouse and a 1,053m-long diversion, spillway and headrace tunnel. For the foundation and dam construction, an upstream and downstream cofferdam was constructed at 1,068m and 1,009m respectively. Construction\u00a0works also included the river bypass through trunk tunnelling, which has a diameter of 12.5m and length of 1,125m. The upstream cofferdam measures 66m, while the downstream is 14m-high. Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) provided a $150m loan facility to Odebrecht Energia for the hydroelectric power plant. The project was also co-financed by Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ\u00f4mico e Social (BNDES), COFIDE (Development Finance Corporation), and other international commercial banks, while BNP Paribas acted as the financial advisor. Alstom was awarded a contract to supply all the hydro and electromechanical equipment, spare parts and services. The scope of supply included two generation units with a total power of 450MW, power transformers and switchyard equipment, as well as the complete mini hydropower plant. Mott MacDonald was engaged by The Bank of New York Mellon as the independent engineer to monitor the power plant construction. The contractual scope included providing support for the lenders in the construction, operations and monitoring phases of the project.
