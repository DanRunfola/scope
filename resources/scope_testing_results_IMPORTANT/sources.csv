6,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-oil-auction-first/china-stakes-claim-in-mexico-oil-opening-at-deep-water-auction-idUSKBN13U2I2,"By Adriana Barrera , David Alire Garcia 4 Min Read MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Monday auctioned eight out of ten deep water oil and gas blocks up for grabs in the Gulf of Mexico, and scored a joint venture for a major crude field in the most hotly-anticipated round of the country’s energy opening so far. China’s Offshore Oil Corporation took two of the eight blocks, while Australia’s BHP Billiton outbid Britain’s BP in a bid to partner with Mexican state oil firm Pemex in the promising Trion light oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. France’s Total also made three winning bids, teaming up with U.S. major ExxonMobil in the Perdido Fold Belt close to the U.S.-Mexico maritime border for one and with Norway’s Statoil and BP for two blocks in the Salina Basin further south. U.S. oil major Chevron, Pemex and Japan’s Inpex combined to win a block while Malaysia’s Petronas Carigali and private equity backed start-up Sierra Offshore Exploration also featured in two winning consortia, one fronted by U.S. independent Murphy and Britain’s Ophir. “This underlines Mexico is very competitive in the oil and gas sector,” said Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell. Before the current administration ends in two years, Mexico will likely hold three more oil auctions for shallow and deep waters, as well as onshore areas, probably including tenders for so-called non-conventional fields like shale, the minister said. Over the next decade, the fields auctioned on Monday could add some 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Mexican output, said Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the national oil regulator. All told, fields containing an estimated 8.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) were awarded.

Joaquin Coldwell extended a “warm welcome” to the Chinese oil firm, which easily won the two blocks they sought. China Offshore’s entry into Mexico looks set to mark the biggest investment by a Chinese company in the country. TRUMP TROUBLE The Mexican unit of BHP Billiton secured the rights to tie-up with Pemex in Trion, less than 50 miles (80 km) from the U.S.-Mexico maritime border. BHP outbid BP by some $18 million with a $624 million offer to complement its 4 percent additional royalty bid. Pemex estimates Trion will require an $11 billion investment to successfully develop. The competition marks the first time the ailing Mexican oil giant will join forces with a private company to drill since losing its monopoly in 2013. Pemex chief executive Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya said the Trion field would produce 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2025, though the company has often missed output targets in the past. The government had said it would be content if four of the 10 blocks went, so the auction was welcome news for Latin America’s No. 2 economy, which has been roiled by fears of economic turmoil by Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president. The peso currency has slumped amid fears Trump will make good on threats to tear up a joint trade deal with Mexico or impose hefty tariffs on Mexican-made goods. It strengthened slightly during the auctions on Monday. Trion is nearly 500 square miles (1,285 sq km) in size and is sandwiched between other blocks in border-straddling Perdido. New investments in the project are expected to begin next year, almost entirely from BHP’s commitment to spend $1.12 billion, while commercial production is not seen coming online until 2022 at the earliest.

Govt to probe $239m spent by 20151017 Rhon­da Krys­tal Ram­bal­ly Fi­nance Min­is­ter Colm Im­bert is set to probe why $239 mil­lion was al­lo­cat­ed by the pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ment to­wards the Cou­va Chil­dren's Hos­pi­tal when the project was be­ing ful­ly fund­ed by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. He raised the is­sue yes­ter­day dur­ing the Stand­ing Fi­nance Com­mit­tee meet­ing on the ex­pen­di­ture of the Min­istry of Hous­ing and Ur­ban De­vel­op­ment held at the Par­lia­ment. Im­bert said it was his un­der­stand­ing that the project was fi­nanced through a gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment loan fa­cil­i­ty with the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment and there­fore, nor­mal­ly, there was no oblig­a­tion for the T&T Gov­ern­ment to fi­nance the con­struc­tion of the hos­pi­tal. The lender is the Ex­port Im­port Bank of Chi­na on be­half of Chi­na. The loan ma­tures in 20 years. Im­bert was re­spond­ing to ques­tions raised by Op­po­si­tion Leader Kam­la Per­sad-Bisses­sar. But in try­ing to find out why no al­lo­ca­tion was made to­wards the hos­pi­tal in 2016, she found her­self be­ing cross-ques­tioned by Im­bert. On Au­gust 14, Per­sad-Bisses­sar ""opened"" the hos­pi­tal; how­ev­er, it has since re­mained closed to the pub­lic. Per­sad-Bisses­sar said an al­lo­ca­tion of $130 mil­lion was made in 2014, an es­ti­mate of $140 mil­lion in 2015 with a re­vised al­lo­ca­tion of $109 mil­lion, and then ""noth­ing"" in 2016 for the hos­pi­tal. She said, ""No al­lo­ca­tion is be­ing made in 2016 and I am ask­ing why. Is it that the hos­pi­tal con­struc­tion has been com­plete? Im­bert said, ""Well, you opened it."" Per­sad-Bisses­sar then said she was ask­ing a ques­tion and that he was now in charge. Af­ter much crosstalk, he said it was Per­sad-Bisses­sar who was the prime min­is­ter at the time who pro­mot­ed the project and se­cured fi­nanc­ing from the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. ""She cut the rib­bon and opened the hos­pi­tal with great fan­fare just be­fore the elec­tion. So, it's just wrong for the Ho­n­ourable Leader of the Op­po­si­tion to say or pre­tend that she does not know. This project, if you have been pay­ing at­ten­tion, has been trans­ferred to the Min­istry of Health and I think we now need to in­ves­ti­gate this since this was sup­posed to be ful­ly fund­ed by the Chi­nese. We need to know why the Gov­ern­ment of Trinidad and To­ba­go was spend­ing mon­ey on this project and I can as­sure you that there will be an in­ves­ti­ga­tion."" He said too that he was shocked that Per­sad-Bisses­sar would ask if con­struc­tion was com­plet­ed on the hos­pi­tal. ""I as­sure this Par­lia­ment that we will find out whether that build­ing was com­plete or not. We will ad­vise the na­tion­al pop­u­la­tion through the medi­um of this Par­lia­ment,"" Im­bert said. More in­fo Con­tact­ed af­ter Par­lia­ment, Im­bert said he al­so in­tend­ed to look at the 2013 ex­pen­di­ture to see if any mon­ey was al­lo­cat­ed to­wards the project. He said via text, ""This is a very ex­pen­sive project, at $1.5 bil­lion where the con­struc­tion cost was $1 bil­lion, and an­oth­er $500 mil­lion was for fees, etc. ""That is an un­usu­al­ly high amount for non-con­struc­tion costs, which are usu­al­ly a max­i­mum of 20 per cent of the con­struc­tion cost for a spe­cialised project."" Ac­cord­ing to a June 1, 2013, ar­ti­cle on news.gov.tt, the es­ti­mat­ed cost of con­struc­tion of the chil­dren's hos­pi­tal was $975 mil­lion. The ar­ti­cle said fund­ing for the in­sti­tu­tion was through a gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment arrange­ment with Chi­na. It said the hos­pi­tal will stand on a 60-acre site on lands from the for­mer Ca­roni (1975) Ltd. How­ev­er, by June 25, 2013, it was an­nounced by for­mer health min­is­ter Dr Fuad Khan that Cab­i­net had ap­proved $1.521 bil­lion for the project. T&T Guardian files showed: �2 pre-con­struc­tion work was es­ti­mat­ed at $53.1 mil­lion for ac­cess roads, bridge, works, place­ment of elec­tric­i­ty and wa­ter lines and nat­ur­al gas lines; �2 con­struc­tion and fit-out works were set at $1.3 bil­lion for de­sign, con­struc­tion and fit-out ex­ter­nal works, land­scap­ing and han­dover; and �2 works to com­ple­tion were put at $464.7 mil­lion for project de­vel­op­ment, con­sul­tan­cy, du­ties, tax­es, site de­vel­op­ment, project man­age­ment, fees and mis­cel­la­neous ex­pens­es, in­clu­sive of se­cu­ri­ty, in­sur­ances and util­i­ties. Khan had said then: ""The to­tal cost of the project is es­ti­mat­ed at $1.520,924, 891.98. In this con­nec­tion, Cab­i­net has ap­proved a bud­get of $1.521 bil­lion.""

Roberto Codallo Shang­hai Con­struc­tion has been award­ed a bil­lion-dol­lar con­tract to build the Port-of-Spain Gen­er­al Hos­pi­tal’s new cen­tral block and the two-year project is ex­pect­ed to be­gin in Sep­tem­ber. St James Med­ical Com­plex will al­so be­come the St James Gen­er­al Hos­pi­tal fol­low­ing a $5m up­grade. Act­ing Prime Min­is­ter Colm Im­bert and Health Min­is­ter Ter­rence Deyals­ingh an­nounced both de­vel­op­ments at Thurs­day’s post-Cab­i­net me­dia brief­ing. Plans had been in place to re­place the seis­mi­cal­ly-chal­lenged cen­tral block since ear­ly last year, but this was ex­pe­dit­ed fol­low­ing the 6.1 mag­ni­tude earth­quake last Au­gust. Im­bert said Cab­i­net had ap­proved the award of a con­tract for Shang­hai Con­struc­tion to build the new block. Of two bid­ders for the project, he said the Chi­nese firm’s bid at $1b was $600m less than the oth­er bid which came from Bouygues Ba­ti­ment, a French com­pa­ny. Shang­hai scored 234 out of 300 points, he added. Deyals­ingh said work to­wards the con­struc­tion of the cen­tral block is in two phas­es. The first part be­gan last Sep­tem­ber with de­mo­li­tion work of build­ings on the lo­ca­tion. This ends in Sep­tem­ber when con­struc­tion of the new block—which will hold 540 beds—be­gins. Com­ple­tion of the cen­tral block may take about 24 to 30 months, Deyals­ingh es­ti­mat­ed. The Gov­ern­ment will fi­nance the project by loan fi­nanc­ing. On Op­po­si­tion crit­i­cisms that the cost of projects done by Chi­nese firms tend­ed to es­ca­late over time, Im­bert said Shang­hai was the same com­pa­ny which built the Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal for the past Peo­ple’s Part­ner­ship ad­min­is­tra­tion and sev­er­al oth­er projects done by the firm did not sus­tain price es­ca­la­tions. Work will al­so be done on the St James Med­ical Com­plex, to ex­pand beds to 88 and add 24/7 hour labs and oth­er fa­cil­i­ties. The $53m up­grade will be done by Chi­na Rail­way. Deyals­ingh said jobs for med­ical per­son­nel will be open­ing up soon as a re­sult of new med­ical fa­cil­i­ties—Ari­ma, Point Fortin and oth­er hos­pi­tals—com­ing on stream. Deyals­ingh al­so praised the re­sponse by Mt Hope Med­ical Cen­tre’s ac­ci­dent and emer­gency unit con­cern­ing Tues­day’s hor­rif­ic ac­ci­dent on the Uri­ah But­ler High­way where a Blue Wa­ters truck crossed the me­di­an and slammed in­to a PTSC bus killing two and in­jur­ing 48 oth­ers.

Sinanan spoke to the me­dia yes­ter­day morn­ing at the launch of the set­ting up of the beams for the bridge of the Curepe In­ter­change. Ac­cord­ing to the web­site of the Min­istry of Works, the Curepe In­ter­change project was ini­ti­at­ed as a so­lu­tion to al­le­vi­at­ing traf­fic con­ges­tion along the Churchill Roo­sevelt High­way, with the elim­i­na­tion of traf­fic sig­nals along the cor­ri­dor and the up­grade of in­ter­sec­tions. He re­mind­ed the pub­lic that in Feb­ru­ary 2019 the Prime Min­is­ter turned the sod for the start of con­struc­tion of the in­ter­change. “We an­tic­i­pate that we should have full use of the bridge by the end of Feb­ru­ary which is about a year in­to the con­struc­tion This has been a ma­jor achieve­ment. So far we are on track with the project. We an­tic­i­pate hav­ing a full han­dover by the end of March. We are hap­py with the per­for­mance of the con­trac­tor,” he said. He added that they have set an am­bi­tious tar­get that would al­low users of the Churchill Roo­sevelt High­way to dri­ve from Port-of-Spain to San­gre Grande with no traf­fic lights in three to four years. “As we speak the ten­der is out for the pri­ma­ry de­sign of the two ad­di­tion­al in­ter­changes, one at Ma­coya and one at Pi­ar­co. The con­sul­tants are go­ing to ad­vise us on where the next in­ter­change should be. We are work­ing on that and we are about to go to Cab­i­net with the re­sults of that ten­der. Very soon we should have a con­tract award­ed for the de­signs for the next in­ter­change. The idea is to re­move all the traf­fic lights from Port-of-Spain all the way to San­gre Grande. We do have traf­fic lights at Tumpuna Road. The East-West Cor­ri­dor Plan is for the re­moval of all the traf­fic lights on the high­way. We can­not build all the in­ter­changes at the same time.” He al­so said that in­con­ve­nience for the pub­lic has been min­imised and the traf­fic flow has been rel­a­tive­ly smooth. He said there were some chal­lenges go­ing back to 2013 and the Min­istry of Works ter­mi­nat­ed that process and start­ed a new pro­cure­ment ex­er­cise which brought the over­all cost of the project down by 50 per cent.

The $1.2 bil­lion hos­pi­tal, equipped with 150 bed spaces, was built by Chi­na Rail­way Con­struc­tion Com­pa­ny. Of the 150 beds, ten will be placed in the In­ten­sive Care Unit (ICU) and High De­pen­den­cy Units. COVID-19 pa­tients who are deemed crit­i­cal at Cau­ra Hos­pi­tal and Cou­va Hos­pi­tal are ward­ed at ICU and HDU. Cou­va Hos­pi­tal re­cent­ly opened its doors to pro­vide health care sole­ly to COVID-19 cas­es. The Ari­ma Hos­pi­tal will adopt the same ap­proach. Noel Gar­cia, chair­man of the Ur­ban De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion of T&T (Ude­cott) who man­aged the bil­lion-dol­lar health­care project beamed with pride yes­ter­day dur­ing a tele­phone in­ter­view with Guardian Me­dia, stat­ing that the much-need­ed hos­pi­tal was “com­plete and ready.” Gar­cia gave de­tails about the new fa­cil­i­ty, stat­ing there are 15 ven­ti­la­tors which would be cru­cial in keep­ing se­vere­ly ill coro­n­avirus pa­tients alive. Con­struc­tion of the fa­cil­i­ty be­gan in Sep­tem­ber 2016 a year af­ter the sod-turn­ing cer­e­mo­ny. “We ran in­to prob­lems with fi­nanc­ing. The Ex­im Bank of Chi­na was sup­posed to fi­nance it but the Gov­ern­ment took a de­ci­sion to put to­geth­er a lo­cal con­sor­tium of banks and that lo­cal con­sor­tium fi­nanced the Ari­ma Hos­pi­tal and not the Chi­nese Ex­im Bank,” Gar­cia ex­plained. The fa­cil­i­ty com­pris­es gy­nae­col­o­gy, pae­di­atrics, psy­chi­a­try, phys­io­ther­a­py and in­ter­nal med­i­cine de­part­ments. There are al­so six op­er­at­ing the­atres and a dial­y­sis suite. Yes­ter­day, Ude­cott hand­ed over the hos­pi­tal to the North Cen­tral Re­gion­al Health Au­thor­i­ty (NCRHA) un­der whose purview the hos­pi­tal now falls. He said the NR­CHA and min­istry would de­ter­mine the num­ber of beds to be used by pa­tients who test pos­i­tive for COVID-19. At a press con­fer­ence last week, Deyals­ingh said the hos­pi­tal will be equipped with 90 beds, four ICU and six HDU specif­i­cal­ly for COVID-19 pa­tients. Guardian Me­dia was told that the min­istry is pro­ject­ed to ac­com­mo­date COVID-19 cas­es ear­ly next week. “Ude­cott has been able to ful­fil the dream of Arim­i­ans and the dream of this present Gov­ern­ment to pro­vide a world-class health care sys­tem.” Ques­tioned when the hos­pi­tal will be opened to the gen­er­al pop­u­la­tion, Gar­cia said when the pan­dem­ic is over. Gar­cia said he was in­struct­ed by Health Min­is­ter Ter­rence Deyals­ingh last month to pre­pare the hos­pi­tal “in the event that it is need­ed in this COVID-19 pan­dem­ic.” Gar­cia said the fa­cil­i­ty was re­con­fig­ured to ac­com­mo­date such pa­tients. “When this (virus) has passed we would have a for­mal open­ing and put it to use that is was de­signed for...that is a gen­er­al hos­pi­tal.” Gar­cia said if Ude­cott is called up­on by Deyals­ingh to build ad­di­tion­al but tem­po­rary bed spaces for COVID-19 pa­tients should we be faced with a cri­sis, they will de­liv­er. “We are sub­ject to the wish­es of the Min­istry of Health. What­ev­er the min­is­ter asks would be based on the ad­vice of their tech­ni­cal peo­ple. Ude­cott is an im­ple­ment­ing agency.” Gar­cia said soon to fol­low would be the de­liv­ery of the Point Fortin Hos­pi­tal.

People walk past a Huawei company logo at a bus stop in Mexico City, Mexico February 22, 2019. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril The contract came with a catch. Altan Redes, the company developing the network, announced that the most delicate work – involving the system’s “core” and sites near the U.S. border – would go to Nokia, and awarded Huawei southern and central Mexico. Political sensitivities around Huawei, which the United States has denounced since 2012 as an untrustworthy agent of the Chinese government, factored into the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. But limiting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s role was easier said than done. While sites along the U.S. border remain with Nokia, Huawei has since gained work in three cities in northern Mexican regions that Altan had said publicly would go to Nokia, according to four other people with knowledge of the matter and messages viewed by Reuters. Huawei began working in the cities late last year, one of the people said. The three cities - Tampico, Torreon and Culiacan – are located in northern Mexico but are not close the border. Altan’s plans for the network are fluid and could change, the sources noted. Altan said in a statement that its decision to divide the work between Nokia and Huawei in that way was made “exclusively on technical and economic optimization criteria,” adding that it was not informed of U.S. concerns about Huawei. The company said no cities awarded to vendors were reassigned, and Huawei and Nokia “equally delivered their plans.” A U.S. State Department official said the department remains concerned that Chinese equipment in 5G networks could give the Chinese government access to sensitive data. A Huawei spokesman described the U.S. campaign as an effort to “attack and contain Huawei, without presenting any concrete evidence.” Huawei’s northward expansion in Altan’s network, previously unreported, underscores the Chinese firm’s combination of speed, manpower and technological sophistication, Mexican telecom executives say. “It’s too late” to reverse Huawei’s strong presence in Mexico, said Marco Galvan, a senior director for trade group GSMA. Huawei’s potent appeal also shows how telecom operators globally are trying to balance the need for the Chinese company’s affordable and reliable equipment with the U.S. campaign to steer countries away from using its gear, Mexican telecom executives say. After acquiring two local wireless companies, AT&T removed Huawei equipment from sensitive parts of its Mexican network. But AT&T still uses the Chinese firm’s gear in the country, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That is due in part to Huawei’s deep bench and swift execution, the people said. “When we upgraded our Mexico network to 4G LTE, we replaced Huawei in our data core network because we wanted a data core network design like we have in the United States,” AT&T Mexico said in a statement. The approaches taken by Altan and AT&T, detailed in interviews with two dozen people familiar with Huawei’s operations, point to new ground rules for working with the Chinese company in Mexico: Limit use of Huawei gear in “the core” - the brains of the cellular network that processes data from towers - and tread carefully along the border. Slideshow ( 2 images ) But some telecom experts say it is harder to wall off the core in the coming fifth generation, or 5G, networks. In its statement, Altan said the nearest Huawei cell site equipment is 1,549 km from the border town of Tijuana and 499 km from Matamoros, which neighbors Texas. “The equipment disperses a signal with a radius of 15 kilometers, so there is not even remotely close contact with the northern border,” Altan said. Three people familiar with the decision said Altan gave the northern cities to Huawei following some problems with Nokia’s performance, including delays submitting documentation and slow response times. Dimitri Diliani, Nokia’s global head of end-to-end solutions, said in an interview that the company met all key objectives and its share of the Altan project has not changed. “You always have hiccups and delays,” he said. “At the end of the day, we passed all of the hurdles.” Specific cities were not assigned in the contract, Diliani said. It is not unusual for some cities to shift within large projects, a Nokia spokeswoman added. Cesar Funes, a Huawei vice president, said Mexican customers have asked the company for its response to the U.S. allegations, but business remains strong. He said he was not aware of whether Huawei had won work in the three cities but noted the company has managed to extend its reach in past projects. Vendors typically start with a certain share of a project, “but based on your performance, you could get more,” he said in an interview. “I have experienced that already in this country.” The U.S. government has intensified its fight against Huawei as countries prepare to deploy 5G networks, which will serve as the gateway to new technological frontiers such as self-driving cars and internet-connected appliances. Altan’s wholesale network, which offers capacity to retail telecom competitors in Mexico, is prepared to quickly transition to 5G, the company has said. TENSION AT THE BORDER As early as the 1990s, Huawei executives began pitching their services in Mexico. Competing aggressively on price and recruiting talent, Huawei eventually won big swaths of the market, supplying virtually all major players, including Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil. The wholesale network, part of a 2013-14 telecom reform aimed at promoting competition, was an enticing opportunity for Huawei to build a cutting-edge network from scratch, Funes said. Backed by a fund managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure and IFC Asset Management Company’s China-Mexico Fund, Altan won a tender to launch the network in 2016. The prospect of Chinese participation in a sophisticated national telecom network attracted U.S. scrutiny early on. The U.S. State Department met with Mexico’s ministry for communications and transportation twice in 2016 to voice concerns about Huawei’s potential involvement in the project, according to a former senior U.S. State Department official. The State Department did not ask Mexico to ban Huawei, but it did warn Mexican officials of security risks posed by the Chinese firm, the former official said. Some Mexican officials questioned why the United States was so concerned since AT&T was working with Huawei in the country, the former official recalled. Salma Jalife, Mexico’s undersecretary for communications and technological development, declined to comment. The State Department also met with Mexico’s Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), which regulates the industry, in late 2016 to discuss concerns regarding Huawei’s potential participation in the network, especially along the border, according to a Mexican official. A U.S. State Department official said the government works closely with Mexico and declined to comment on specific meetings. An IFT spokeswoman declined to comment. The Huawei spokesman stressed the company’s independence from the Chinese government. Altan ultimately struck its compromise, tapping both Huawei and Nokia. “The balance of the allocation of infrastructure between the technological providers is optimal, avoiding an exclusive dependence on either one,” Altan said in a statement. Most carriers in Mexico are still sold on Huawei, said Galvan of GSMA. “(Huawei) brought as many resources as necessary to Mexico from China,” he said. “They did what it takes.” Reporting by Julia Love; additional reporting by Tarmo Virki and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin ",2019-05-09 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-15 19:09:16.930640+00:00,EXTM

In an event held in Yaguaramas town in the central province of Cienfuegos, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Chen Xi handed the management of the two parks over to the Cuban Ministry of Energy and Mines. ""These two parks have a total capacity of 9 megawatts (MW) and the one in Yaguaramas is the largest in Cuba with 19,440 solar panels installed,"" Chen said. After 18 months of construction, the two parks, one in the western province of Pinar del Rio and the other in Yaguaramas, started operations in February. ""This is a sign of friendship and willingness by the Chinese government towards the Cuban people. The confidence, brotherhood and solidarity between our countries grow day by day,"" Chen said.

Odebrecht earlier in the day said it had signed a deal to sell its 456 megawatt Chaglla plant in northern Peru to the consortium. It declined to comment on price. The deal marks China Three Gorges’ first venture into Peru as the presence of Chinese companies grows in Latin America. The consortium also includes China's Hubei Energy Group Co Ltd 000883.SZ , which on Thursday said it would buy 40 percent of the Odebrecht subsidiary that owns Chaglla for $277 million. Hubei and China Three Gorges, one of the world’s largest hydroelectric power producers, could not be reached for comment. Odebrecht is at the center of Latin America’s biggest graft scandal having admitted to paying bribes from Peru to Panama. It is trying to shrink its debt as it faces over $2.6 billion in fines and bans on bidding for government contracts in Peru and Argentina. It said Peru’s justice ministry and Chinese regulators must approve the latest deal before it can be finalized. The pending sale of another Odebrecht asset in Peru, its Olmos irrigation business, was blocked by the court following a petition from a special attorney who has since been dismissed. Odebrecht told Reuters this month that it did not expect the sale of other Peru assets to be blocked as earnings generated would help it pay Peru reparations for bribery.

Slideshow ( 6 images ) China’s Xinjiang TBEA Group Co Ltd will hold a 49 percent stake in a planned joint venture with Bolivia’s state lithium company YLB, the Bolivian firm said. Together, the companies will seek to produce lithium and other materials from the Coipasa and Pastos Grandes salt flats. Bolivia estimates that development of the projects will cost at least $2.3 billion. The Chinese firm will provide initial investment and YLB will pay its share with future lithium production, YLB’s executive manager Juan Carlos Montenegro said by phone. Bolivia has some of the world’s largest reserves of lithium - a key component in batteries that power electric cars - but has yet to produce the metal at a commercial scale. The preliminary deal gives Beijing a fresh chance at locking in access to Bolivia’s lithium after German firm ACI Systems GmbH was chosen last year as partner on the country’s largest lithium deposit in the salt flats of Uyuni. Xinjiang TBEA beat six rivals that also sought to partner with Bolivia on Coipasa and Pastos Grandes, including ACI, Uranium One - a subsidiary of Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom - and the Irish company Clontarf Energy Plc. “Why China? There’s a guaranteed market in China for battery production,” Bolivian President Evo Morales said in broadcast comments at a signing ceremony in the highland city of Oruro. China, the biggest global consumer of lithium, will need 800,000 tonnes of the metal per year by 2025 to support its booming electric car industry, China’s Ambassador to Bolivia Liang Yu said at the same event, hailing the deal as “historic.” There are no estimates yet for how much lithium Coipasa and Pastos Grandes hold. Bolivia said last month that a new study found that Uyuni likely has at least 21 million tonnes of lithium, more than double a previous estimate. Despite its abundant reserves and growing global demand for the metal, Bolivia’s state-led plans to industrialize its lithium have faced repeated delays. The next steps on Coipasa and Pastos Grandes will be to conduct feasibility studies, YLB said. “This investment is not going to happen in a year. It’s a long process of several years,” Bolivia’s Deputy Minister of High Energy Technologies Luis Alberto Echazu said. YLB added that it might partner with Xinjiang TBEA on a lithium battery plant in China.

The three 300,000-barrel cargoes will make up WEPEC’s biggest monthly shipment to the Latin American country, said the source, who asked not to be named. The 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) Dalian-based refinery, one of China’s main export-focused refineries, first sent gasoline to Mexico in the second-half of 2018 as it looked for markets beyond Asian oil hub Singapore, its traditional export destination. The lower-grade export fuel, which has an octane number of 91, is produced by blending lower-grade gasoline with naphtha, said the source, without giving further details. Mexico has become increasingly dependent on fuel imports, mainly from the United States, due to a fall in domestic output because of longstanding refinery problems, forcing state-run Pemex to import nearly 600,000 bpd of fuel last year. The WEPEC refinery, operated by state oil and gas major PetroChina, is one of China’s largest gasoline exporters with monthly overseas shipments estimated at some 1.3 million barrels, said the source. PetroChina did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Could two entirely incompatible sets of values - authoritarianism and democracy - be held together, if not in harmony, then at least in some kind of mutual accommodation, in one city? This was exactly what the Sino-British deal of 1984 had in mind as it laid the groundwork for the territory's eventual handback to China in 1997. ""One Country, Two Systems"", as the formula is known, is meant to allow Hong Kong to continue until at least 2047 with its free speech, its independent courts and its vibrant - if limited - democracy, while the new sovereign power maintains its rigid, one-party rule. The spectacle of China's stage-managed National People's Congress imposing sweeping changes on Hong Kong's political system - by a true-to-form unanimous vote - is for many observers the moment that experiment goes up in smoke. image copyrightEPA image captionOf NPC delegates, 2,895 voted in favour of the changes, none against As China frequently points out, Hong Kong's former colonial masters were slow to offer its citizens a democratic voice. There may well have been good reasons for the foot-dragging, not least the warnings as far back as the 1950s from China that any attempt to introduce self-governance would lead to invasion. Nonetheless, the Hong Kong handed to China - while democratically deficient in terms of universal suffrage - had other deeply ingrained freedoms that were part and parcel of its status as a free-wheeling capitalist economy and a free-trading port. ""Although we've never had democracy,"" former Democratic Party spokesperson Emily Lau tells me, ""the irony is the level of freedoms, personal safety and the rule of law that we have enjoyed for decades is much higher than in some places that have periodic elections."" Those traditions are in stark contrast to the system of governance practised by its political masters in Beijing, and that tension has been at the heart of the tussle over what the ""two systems"" part of the bargain means ever since. The turning point China argues that it has tried to uphold the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that was meant to embody the spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. It has even attempted in good faith, it says, to enact Article 45 which calls for the introduction of universal suffrage for the election of the city's leader, the chief executive. The plan was scuppered by the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"" driven by anger over the mechanism for choosing the candidates in which Beijing would continue to wield a veto. image copyrightGetty Images image captionThe ""Umbrella Movement"" protests swept Hong Kong in 2014 The attempts to enact a National Security Law, again stipulated by the Basic Law, has also led to protests. In the end, the sticking point has been less a question of the technicalities of the proposed changes - and more a question of profound distrust. Most countries have national security legislation, all democratic systems are imperfect in some way, but few have these institutions overseen by a rising, authoritarian superpower. And the tragedy for Hong Kong's beleaguered pro-democracy movement is that each time it has tried to push back against Beijing, it has found itself worse off than before. After the crackdown, Hong Kongers fear the future The tipping point came with the massive, sometimes violent, protests in 2019 over plans to introduce an extradition bill, potentially allowing Hong Kong suspects to be sent for trial in China. The disorder gave Beijing the pretext it needed to finally push through the National Security Law, which had an overnight, chilling effect on the ability to protest. The law sets out vague, sweeping offences of ""secession"", ""subversion"", and ""collusion"" with foreign forces, and with the possibility of extradition a central feature. Serious cases can be transferred to the mainland for trial with far less oversight than would have been the case under the rejected extradition bill. image copyrightGetty Images image captionProtests erupted in 2019 against moves to send some Hong Kong suspects for trial in China A series of dawn raids in January saw 55 politicians and activists arrested, with 47 now charged. Simply holding up protest banners or the wearing of T-shirts are potentially enough to get someone detained. The effort by Hong Kong democrats ahead of last year's elections to hold unofficial primaries - as a tactical way to increase their chance of winning a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo) - looked like it might almost have succeeded. They had, after all, swept the board at the 2019 local elections - the city's only genuinely democratic poll - a result that confirmed the depth of the support for their cause and one that will have seriously spooked Beijing. But the LegCo primaries plan backfired too - the election was cancelled - ostensibly for reasons of pandemic control - and Beijing brought in the reforms now rubber stamped by the National People's Congress, and under which the chances of pro-democrats winning a majority have gone for good. Emily Lau is in no doubt about the significance of the new requirement that all candidates will be vetted, by a committee stuffed with Beijing loyalists, to make sure they're ""patriots"". ""If they are going to impose a system on Hong Kong whereby the voters would in effect be disenfranchised and whereby my party or other pro-democracy people will not be free to take part in elections independently and freely, then One Country, Two Systems is over,"" she says. Democracy gives way Even Hong Kong's pro-Beijing politicians appear to suggest that something fundamental has changed. Regina Ip is the founder of the New People's Party, with a seat in LegCo and a member of the governing Executive Council. While she insists that One Country, Two Systems isn't over, she seems less certain about whether it any longer aims to accommodate democracy. ""I think Beijing may be exploring a movement toward alternative systems, such as what some Western thinkers advocate - epistocracy - the rule by more knowledgeable, high information people,"" she tells me. I put it to her that such a system sounds very undemocratic. ""A democratic system has no intrinsic value unless it can deliver good outcomes,"" she replies. ""We have had 23 years of experiments with democracy, the outcomes are far from satisfactory. We are underperforming in many ways."" media captionThe HK pro-democracy protesters who face a tough decision over continuing their fight or fleeing to the UK Chinese state media also appears to be moving the goalposts , arguing that One Country, Two Systems has always referred not to political differences, but rather to the need to preserve two different economic systems. The British signatories to the handover agreement may once have hoped that the fundamental contradiction at the heart of it would be resolved as China modernised, enacted its own internal reforms, and moved politically closer towards Hong Kong. If so, it has proved wishful thinking, with China arguably more authoritarian than it was at the time the treaty was signed. ""As an inalienable part of China, we cannot afford to be a country that undermines the security of China,"" Regina Ip says. ""If they don't think the current system is sustainable, the option will be to reintegrate Hong Kong, even before 2047."" It is Hong Kong that is changing and in the long tussle between those two, incompatible sets of values, it is democracy that is finally giving way. Emily Lau, the former Democratic Party chairperson, tells me she knows she is taking a risk, even speaking to the foreign media. ""Well of course there's a risk,"" she says, ""but I mean, frankly I don't think I have breached the National Security Law. ""But that's me saying so… and if they say, oh yes you have, well, that's it. Maybe when this interview is over, someone will be knocking on my door.""

The woman will receive 50,000 yuan ($7,700; £5,460) for five years of unpaid labour. The case has generated a huge debate online over the value of domestic work, with some saying the compensation amount was too little. The ruling comes after China's introduction of a new civil code. 'Banshee, shrew': An angry song wants women to be seen According to court records, the man identified by his surname Chen had filed for divorce last year from his wife, surnamed Wang, after getting married in 2015. She was reluctant to divorce at first, but later requested financial compensation, arguing that Chen had not shouldered any housework or childcare responsibilities for their son. Beijing's Fangshan District Court ruled in her favour, ordering him to pay her monthly alimony of 2,000 yuan, as well as the one-off payment of 50,000 yuan for the housework she has done. The presiding judge told reporters on Monday that the division of a couple's joint property after marriage usually entails splitting tangible property. ""But housework constitutes intangible property value,"" said the judge. The ruling was made according to the new civil code in the country, which came into effect this year. Under the new law, a spouse is entitled to seek compensation in a divorce if he or she bears more responsibility in child raising, caring for elderly relatives, and assisting partners in their work. Previously, divorcing spouses could only request such compensation if a prenuptial agreement had been signed - an uncommon practice in China. On social media, the case sparked heated debate, with a related hashtag on microblogging platform Weibo viewed more than 570 million times. Some social media users pointed out that 50,000 yuan for five years' of work was too little. ""I'm a bit speechless, the work of a full-time housewife is being underestimated. In Beijing, hiring a nanny for a year costs more than 50,000 yuan,"" said one commenter. Others pointed out that men should assume more household duties in the first place. Some also called on women to continue pursuing their careers after marriage. ""Ladies, remember to always be independent. Don't give up work after marriage, give yourself your own way out,"" wrote one social media user. Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Chinese women spend nearly four hours a day on unpaid work - roughly 2.5 times that of men. It is higher than the average in OECD countries, where women spend twice the amount of time as men on unpaid work.

REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez/File Photo BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday it will simplify visa applications for foreign nationals who have been inoculated with Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines, its latest small step towards normalising international travel. Vaccinated passengers travelling to China by air will still need to show negative tests as under current rules, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said, according to an official transcript of a daily briefing. The transcript did not provide further details on how visa applications would be simplified. Travellers “should abide by China’s relevant regulations on quarantine and observation after entering China,” Zhao said, adding that China was willing to carry out mutual recognition of vaccination with other nations. The Chinese embassy in the Philippines said earlier on Monday China would return to pre-pandemic visa requirements for those fully vaccinated with Chinese vaccines. On Saturday China announced streamlined visa procedures for vaccinated foreigners entering Chinese-ruled Hong Kong. China has been exporting its vaccines mostly to emerging countries. This outreach prompted the United States, Australia, Japan and top global vaccine producer India to announce plans to distribute vaccines in Asia in a competition that has become known as “vaccine diplomacy”. China has largely brought the coronavirus under control at home since it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. The country recorded just five new infections on Sunday, all imported cases. To stave off the risk of imported cases causing a resurgence in local infections, China restricts entry by foreign nationals to certain purposes, such as work, and those that are allowed in still have to undergo quarantine.

Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez poses with China's Ambassador to Argentina Zou Xiaoli, at the Olivos Presidential Residence, in Buenos Aires, Argentina March 17, 2020. Esteban Collazo/Argentina Presidency/Handout via REUTERS At the meeting in the wealthy Olivos suburb of Buenos Aires, ambassador Zou Xiaoli laid out how the Asian giant was ready to help Argentina face the pandemic: donating masks, gloves, thermometers and protective suits. The donations, welcomed by Fernandez’s government, show how China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is jostling for influence against the United States. From Argentina to Mexico, Brazil to Peru, Latin American nations have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases across the region has climbed, amid growing fears about the preparedness of their healthcare systems. There have been nearly 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, and over 20,000 deaths. Although South America has so far not been as hard hit as other parts of the world, experts fear that may change as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere. “Some countries in the region have reached out to China asking for help,” a Chinese official in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. “We will share with them our experience in combating COVID-19 and offer sanitary materials within our capacity.” As trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have simmered in recent years, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Latin American nations that they should be wary of becoming too economically reliant on China - to little avail. In Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, China has made steady in-roads, from solar power investments to the construction of a new space monitoring station. It has supplied over $17 billion of financing since 2007, Inter-American Dialogue data shows. China has also become the top consumer of Argentine soybeans and beef. As the coronavirus spread in China, Argentina’s new left-leaning leader Fernandez - who took office in December - exchanged correspondence with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In letters seen by Reuters, Fernandez offered solidarity to China in February as the virus raged from the outbreak center of Wuhan. In March, Xi replied that the situation in China was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations. Days later, the Chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on Twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the Argentine capital. “China will continue to help in all possible channels. Long live friendship!” the embassy said on Twitter. The help came at a difficult time for Argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund. “This is part of the link we have with China, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,” a spokesman for Argentina’s foreign ministry told Reuters, when asked about the donations. INFORMATION CONTROL China’s aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend, as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. Instead, China wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say. Luo Zhaohui, a vice minister at China’s foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that the country would “ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.” While Trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic ‘the Chinese virus,’ China has won praise among Latin American governments that have accepted its help. The Chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations. “It’s remarkable and a credit, in a way, to China’s own commanding control of information that it’s been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,” said Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. Myers said the recent re-start of Chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world’s production slows. “This will create opportunities for China in the coming years,” she said. The United States, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the World Health Organization warning on Tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis. Before the epidemic hit hardest, Washington in February pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating COVID-19, including for developing nations. A regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available. THANK YOU, CHINA In Latin America, China’s hands-on approach has been well received. Chile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from Chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to China to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, Chile’s health minister said. In Mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from China, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in Panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with Chinese experts to work on strategy, something China has done with more than 100 countries. In Venezuela, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said China would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. The country has also opened talks with China over possible financial support. “Thank you China for cooperation and solidarity with Ecuador!” the country’s Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner wrote on Twitter, itemizing help from China that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits. In Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with China and Chinese officials have said Beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance. Chinese firms, including Alibaba BABA.N , Huawei, COFCO, China Communications Construction and the Bank of China have pledged donations around the region. Back in Argentina, Washington is keen to show that it also wants to help. “We plan this week to make funds available to Argentine authorities to combat coronavirus,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires told Reuters, adding the country was “looking at the possibility of additional donations.” Reporting by Cassandra Garrison; additional reporting by Yew Lun Tian in Beijing; Aislinn Laing and Dave Sherwood in Santiago; Luc Cohen in Caracas; Jake Spring in Brasilia; Eli Moreno in Panama City, and Diego Oré Oviedo in Mexico City; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Rosalba O’Brien ",2020-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-15 19:21:22.477720+00:00,EXTM

The message failed to hit home. FILE PHOTO: A truck unloads soy grains in a silo bag on a farmland in Chivilcoy, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina. China is the No. 1 buyer of Argentine soybeans. Picture taken April 8, 2020. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File Photo As President-elect Joe Biden readies to enter the White House on Jan. 20, Beijing has tightened its grip over vast swathes of the resource-rich region once seen as the United States’ political backyard. A Reuters investigation, including interviews with current and former officials and advisers, and an analysis of trade data, found that under Trump, China has left the United States trailing in terms of power and influence across most of Latin America. That poses a challenge for Biden, who has pledged to restore Washington’s role as a global leader after years of Trump’s “America First” policies, and has said that slipping U.S. influence in Latin American is a threat to national security. “They should be on notice that Trump’s incompetence and neglect in Latin America and the Caribbean will end on day one of my administration,” Biden told Americas Quarterly in March. His team declined to comment for this story. That pledge won’t be easy to fulfill. Since 2018, China has overtaken the United States as the biggest trade partner to Latin America - if Mexico is removed from the calculations - hoovering up Andean copper, Argentine grains and Brazilian meat. Beijing has ramped up investment and low-interest loans to the region too, backing energy projects, solar farms, dams, ports, railway lines and highways. Bolivian ex-President Jorge Quiroga explained the draw of China during an interview with Reuters in La Paz earlier this year, adding that along with local powerhouse Brazil it was the most important partner. “People ask me who I prefer, the United States or Europe? I say Brazil. What about in second place? I say China. That’s the reality of South America,” Quiroga said. ‘TRUMP DIDN’T SHOW ANY INTEREST’ Officials in the region cautioned that China, a major economic and diplomatic partner for many nations, will be difficult to unseat. Billions of Chinese dollars have given crucial lifelines for indebted emerging countries, a need that has been sharpened by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. “I think China has more interest in Argentina than the United States has in Argentina. And that is what makes the difference,” an Argentine government official told Reuters. “Trump did not show any interest. Let’s hope Biden does.” China is now the number one trade partner to Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and others. It far outstrips the United States in terms of trade with Argentina. Outside of Mexico, China’s trade with the region overtook the United States in 2018 and extended that in 2019 to more than $223 billion versus U.S. trade of $198 billion, according to an analysis of trade figures from the U.N. Comtrade database. The United States does remain far larger when Mexico - its top trade partner globally last year - is included. The Trump administration was viewed by some countries in the region as doing little more than finger-wagging at Latin American counterparts for getting too close to China, particularly through cheap financing or technology ties as the race for 5G dominance heats up. Mark Feierstein, who advised former President Barack Obama, said Trump’s lack of engagement and exit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade bloc created a vacuum that China had filled - and that Biden will look to reverse. “What Trump has done is make China look like a better partner. All that will change,” said Feierstein, now a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group and CLS Strategies. ‘STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE’ A Democratic Biden White House would likely give greater priority to Latin America, analysts and former advisers said, though will be juggling that with a tough pandemic recovery and resetting ties in Europe and Asia. Janet Napolitano, former secretary of homeland security under Obama, said her experience of Biden was that he saw a “strategic advantage to the United States of having very strong relations throughout Central and South America”. Biden will keep pushing similar warnings against getting close to China, but may aim to win back hearts and minds with offers of more financial incentives and a return to humanitarian aid that Trump cut, experts said. “(His administration will) recognize the dependence in South America on the Chinese market for commodities, and try much more energetically and generously to offer support,” said Benjamin Gedan, a former National Security Council official under Obama and now a scholar at the Wilson Center. ECONOMIC DIPLOMACY China seized the opportunity during the pandemic to deepen ties across Latin America, sending medical supplies including ventilators and masks to combat COVID-19. In Argentina, the government has announced in recent months a flurry of new or expanded initiatives with China, vaccine trials, an extended currency swap, cooperation on space, and a Chinese military studies course for students at the South American country’s national defense college. The two countries have discussed a potential state visit to China by President Alberto Fernandez and about Argentina joining Beijing’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Inter-American Dialogue, said that while Chinese sovereign lending had dipped a bit, in its place had come commercial bank financing. “China’s economic diplomacy, whether through trade or finance, has opened a wide range of doors,” she said, citing a $2.4 billion loan to Ecuador this year by China Exim Bank. The United States had appeared to change course in the months leading up to last month’s presidential election, rolling out its own set of initiatives in the region in a bid to compete with China, though many saw these as too little, too late. “This is a great power competition, and it’s playing out all over the world, including Latin America,” said one senior U.S. administration official, who asked not to be named. “We have a strategy and we’re pushing back.” Francis Fannon, State Department Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources, fresh off a visit to Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Panama, said the pandemic risked pushing some countries in the region towards partners like China. “With COVID, it is affecting economic decision making and is affecting the psychology of countries. We want to encourage countries to continue on the reform-minded path that they have been on,” Fannon told Reuters. “The United States is the partner of choice. It has been, and continues to be.” Reporting by Cassandra Garrison in Buenos Aires; Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal in Washington and Jamie McGeever in Brasilia; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Daniel Wallis ",2020-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-15 19:21:23.490345+00:00,EXTM

Noting that the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in Ecuador, Xi offered sincere sympathies on behalf of the Chinese government and people. Xi stressed that at the most demanding stage of China's fight against COVID-19, the Ecuadorian government provided timely anti-epidemic supplies to China. After the epidemic broke out in Ecuador, the Chinese government, local authorities, enterprises and civil organizations quickly reached out to help Ecuador, which illustrated the two countries' friendly tradition of helping and supporting each other, Xi said. Xi said he believes that under the leadership of President Moreno, Ecuador will prevail over the epidemic at an early date, and get back to the track of sound development. Xi said he hopes the Ecuadorian side will continue to protect Chinese companies and citizens who work and study in the South American country. He pointed out that as the pandemic is still spreading in the world, only with solidarity and cooperation can all countries finally win the battle against the disease. China is willing to continue cooperation with other countries to fight the disease and jointly promote the building of a community of common health for mankind, Xi said. China firmly supports enhancing macro policy coordination among countries to stabilize the global economy and improve global governance, he said. Xi stressed that many important consensuses were reached during President Moreno's successful state visit to China in 2018. With joint efforts, the two countries have achieved fruitful results in their pragmatic cooperation in various fields, Xi added. China attaches importance to developing its relations with Ecuador and is willing to communicate actively with the Ecuadorian side to overcome difficulties brought by the epidemic so as to resume and advance their pragmatic cooperation, promote their comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level after the epidemic and better benefit the two peoples, Xi said. For his part, Moreno said that the Chinese government and people provided valuable assistance and support to Ecuador in combating COVID-19, which greatly contributed to his country's response to the pandemic. Noting that China is Ecuador's important comprehensive strategic partner, Moreno said the bilateral cooperation is based on friendship and mutual benefits. He said that Ecuador hopes to learn from China's successful experience in fighting the disease and strengthen cooperation with China to help his country overcome difficulties, prevail over the epidemic, and revitalize its economic development. Moreno said he is willing to keep close contact with Xi and jointly promote the development of the Ecuador-China relationship.

WASHINGTON - The Central African Republic might seem like an unusual venue for Russia’s evolving strategy in Africa. The CAR doesn’t boast Ethiopia’s booming economy or Angola’s deep oil reserves. It lacks a developed mining industry like Zambia or a strategic location like Djibouti. But the landlocked country of fewer than 5 million people, most of whom survive on subsistence farming, has something else of interest to Moscow: conflict. Since 2013, the CAR has grappled with a protracted civil war . Mass displacements, political instability, and competing factions of rebels and militia groups have weakened the government and eroded peoples’ trust in its institutions. In the ensuing volatility, Russia has found opportunities to project power far beyond its borders and rekindle strategic partnerships in Africa that have been dormant since the end of the Cold War. After Decades-Long Hiatus, Russia Seeks Renewed Africa Ties Russia has re-emerged as a potential player in Africa after a 20-year hiatus, but the consequences of their comeback aren’t yet clear. ‘Armed adventurism’ Russia has stepped up its presence in the CAR in the past few years. But its strategies there, which rely on the use of private contractors and mercenary groups, have been employed since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s and, later, in Ukraine and Syria. “We should think about mercenaries as an instrument which allows plausible deniability but also hard-power projection, which has multiple uses in contested areas,” said Kiril Avramov, a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin’s Intelligence Studies Project. Avramov told VOA’s Russian service that Moscow officially bans mercenaries and security companies, but ex-military or intelligence officers often organize them, providing close ties to the Kremlin. Their work, which Avramov called “armed adventurism,” has helped Russia rebound from isolation and advance its political objectives. One company, Wagner Group, has come under increasing scrutiny. This summer, three journalists investigating Wagner’s operations in the CAR were ambushed and killed. Footage captured by the journalists suggests Wagner may have been assisting both the government and rebels. Marie-Noëlle Koyara, the CAR’s minister of defense, told VOA’s French-to-Africa service that the Russian journalists had not secured appropriate media credentials from the Ministry of Communication. “All who arrive here to cover news, no matter what event, they are always welcome, but they have to respect the procedure,” Koyara said. She hopes authorities can piece together what happened to the slain journalists “to take away lessons.” “We would really like to know the true cause of these assassinations,” Koyara said. ‘Club of illiberals’ For Russia, private military contractors complement a broader strategy focused on strengthening state sovereignty, Avramov said. “The current Kremlin is trying to export counterrevolution,” he added. Rather than destabilize regimes, Russia looks for countries already besieged, from the CAR to Syria. These governments welcome help, Avramov said, and that provides Russia with multiple opportunities, from weapons deals to training programs. In the CAR, Moscow has gone a step further, cementing deals for political consultations, joint foreign operations and security details for the president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra. In the future, mineral mining might present opportunities to “entrepreneurs and their little private armies,” Avramov said, even if the sector is currently underdeveloped. But the country may be getting more than it bargains for. “You’re going to get what I call the ‘club of illiberals.’ You buy insurance, and then you receive a package,” Avramov said. That package includes mercenary groups, such as Wagner, which often have ties to both oligarchs and political elites. “You somehow start losing a grasp (on) where the private ends and the state begins,” Avramov said. Countries also can end up pawns in Russia’s geopolitical ambitions. In the CAR, Russia is “playing in the backyard of France and trying to sow division with the neighbors,” Avramov said. And while Russia may not want the countries with which it aligns to plummet into chaos, quick resolutions to the battles it inserts itself into aren’t desirable, either. Drawn-out conflict means more time to sell arms, secure energy contracts and counterbalance China. Despite outpacing Russia in political alliances and economic deals, Beijing faces real competition from Moscow, Avramov said. Compared to China, “(Russia) is punching above its weight, and it’s doing it in a very spectacular manner,” he added. Logistics facility Two thousand kilometers from the CAR, Moscow sees opportunities in another country dealing with the fallout of war. Eritrea, in East Africa, emerged this summer from decades of active conflict with Ethiopia, followed by 20 years of isolation. In August, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed plans to build a logistics center at the Port of Assab, in southern Eritrea, during a meeting with a high-level Eritrean delegation, according to RIA, a Russian state-owned news agency. Russia-Eritrea Relations Grow with Planned Logistics Center Russia and Eritrea expanded their diplomatic relationship when Moscow announced plans to build a logistics center at a port in the East African country.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov disclosed the plans at a meeting with a high-level delegation from Eritrea, according to RIA, a Russian state-owned news agency.The scope, location and timeline of the project have not been announced. Avramov said it makes sense for Russia to pursue the base, along with similar partnerships. “We will see those activities on the rise,” he said, citing Russia’s desire for recognition as a world superpower and its need for diplomatic relationships. Countries steeped in conflict give Moscow a chance to develop a longterm presence, Avramov added, despite limited resources. They also give the Kremlin a chance to send a message, both to China and the West. “It’s a way of saying, ‘If you’re criticized for your human rights record, if you’re criticized for any of the things the West clings on, here is always another option,’” Avramov said.

WASHINGTON - When a crowd in Bambari, in the Central African Republic, accused Mahamat Nour Mamadou of belonging to a militia group tied to the country’s previous regime, the consequences were swift and harsh. Soldiers whisked Mamadou away to a nearby town hall, where he was questioned, and then to a base, where he was tortured for five days. Mamadou told the AFP news agency that soldiers choked him with a chain, slashed his back with a knife and sliced off one of his fingers. Evidence of the abuse he endured appeared in an internal United Nations report circulated last month. Government-sanctioned torture isn’t unusual in conflict-scarred countries where authoritarian regimes fear popular uprisings and armed rebels. What makes Mamadou’s case unique is the group he says tortured him: Russian soldiers. The U.N. is now investigating allegations of torture at the hands of Russians in the CAR based on Manadou’s account, AFP reported. Military ties Private military contractors from Russia have, in recent years, stepped into a pivotal role in central Africa, including in the CAR and neighboring Sudan. Working closely with local governments, PMCs are providing security, gathering intelligence and training local armies. In the CAR, they’re advising the president. In Sudan, they’re guarding gold, diamond and uranium mines. Moscow has downplayed the groups’ roles and insists that they act independently of the Kremlin’s wishes. But experts say the contractors have close ties to Russia’s military apparatus, and their presence helps Moscow achieve its strategic goals, from acquiring needed resources to competing with China and the United States, both of whom have permanent bases in Africa and more military might. Jonathan Hutson is a human rights advocate and strategic communications consultant in Washington. He told VOA that Russian PMCs do the Kremlin’s bidding. “They’re really pretending to be mercenaries while actually functioning as part of Russia’s military intelligence arm, the GRU,” Hutson said. ‘Geopolitical ambitions’ “It’s being done with the knowledge and the aid of Russian government bodies,” said David Isenberg, an independent analyst who has studied private security contractors since the 1980s and testified before Congress on the topic. “This is basically part and parcel of Russia’s greater geopolitical ambitions in Africa and elsewhere in the world,” he added. The Russian Ministry of Defense, for example, helps issue passports to contractors, Isenberg said. PMCs also use weapons supplied by the Russian government and, on occasion, fly Russian military planes to destinations in Africa, Isenberg added. He estimates that about 175 Russian PMCs are in the Central African Republic, and at least 300 are in Sudan. So far, the model has proved successful for Moscow. Just a few hundred people on the ground in central Africa have provided Russia with access to both resources and power. FILE - Russian President Vladimir Putin talks with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during their meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia, Nov. 23, 2017. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin flew Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to Sochi, in western Russia, to discuss strategic interests. Al-Bashir said he needed protection, and he promised minerals in return. Since then, Russian involvement in the country has only increased, even as Sudan convulses under growing civil unrest, prompting protests and a violent crackdown on the press. ‘A shady area’ Whether PMCs are legal hasn’t been settled. In Russia, Hutson said, “It is illegal for private military contractors to exist. However, the Wagner Group, which is present in Sudan, is actually sponsored by the Russian government. They fly on Russian military planes. When they’re wounded, they’re treated in Russian military hospitals.” “It’s a shady area,” Isenberg said. A United Nations convention against mercenaries barely took effect due to low numbers of signatories, he added, and enforcement has been spotty. In a legal gray zone, outside the kind of traditional approach to security that would be subject to more diplomatic scrutiny, Russia has helped suppress protests and gather intelligence, Hutson said. “It’s much more opaque, and therefore much more difficult to deal with,” Isenberg added. But even as unrest in Sudan and the Central African Republic continue, Russia’s bets appear well placed. With a modest investment, they’ve found strategic allies and access to resources. Now, they’re planning a base in Sudan, along the Red Sea. But what benefits authoritarian regimes appears less helpful to the people of nations with a PMC presence. “It’s not actually war, but it’s not peace, either,” Isenberg said. “It is exploiting existing turmoil and disorder to their advantage.” By ",2019-02-13 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-19 03:21:44.239694+00:00,EXTM

WASHINGTON - Known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “chef” because of the billions he made in the catering business, Russian financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin had far more cooking abroad, including meddling in U.S. elections and suppressing democracy in Sudan, according to U.S. charges. Now, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is issuing strong deterrents to ensure that Prigozhin and his network of offshore interests and fronts for mercenaries do not interfere in Sudan's future. FILE - Yevgeny Prigozhin gestures during a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Konstantin palace outside St. Petersburg, Russia, August 9, 2016. This month the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on businesses tied to Prigozhin. The Putin ally is accused of supporting former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and advising him to violently suppress protests. In return for this support, Sudan gave businesses linked to Prigozhin access to gold and the ores of precious metals. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Prigozhin has been “exploiting Sudan’s natural resources for personal gain and spreading malign influence around the globe.” The U.S. action comes as Sudan is struggling to form a democratic government as protests are growing in intensity against the transitional government charged with reforming the legislative system and the judiciary. With Bashir jailed, U.S. officials do not want Prigozhin to serve as a conduit for Russian meddling in Sudan's future. Prigozhin, who denies interfering in the West, Africa and Asia, finances the actions of Russia’s Internet Research Agency, a massive online troll farm accused of trying to influence elections around the world.

As payment for this support, Bashir’s regime is accused by the Treasury Department of granting gold mining concessions to Meroe Gold, a subsidiary of M-Invest. “What Russia is doing is practicing a new form of colonialism, and they are exploiting the natural resources of Sudan. The natural heritage of the Sudanese youth who are peacefully protesting is being given away to Russians,” Jonathan Hutson, a human rights advocate in Washington, told VOA last year. Alleged Torture Case Renews Focus on Russian Military Contractors in Central Africa The U.N. is investigating allegations of torture at the hands of Russians in the CAR, AFP reported. Even though Prigozhin and the businesses are outside of U.S. jurisdiction, the sanctions can still have a strong effect, analysts say. US Sanctions Companies Linked to Businessman Close to Putin The actions take aim at front companies that US officials say Yevgeny Prigozhin has relied on to process millions of dollars and to evade sanctions in Sudan “There is a huge reputational impact that comes with that designation by (the Office of Foreign Assets Control),” Baldo said, adding that the move will make it difficult for Pregozhin-linked businesses to operate around the world. “This leads to the freezing of its accounts and assets that are within reach of U.S. jurisdiction, of course. But it also leads to delisting by international financial institutions and international corporations from dealing with a company that is sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury,” he said. Meroe Gold, a mining company listed in the sanctions, is still active in Sudan and has deep ties to Sudan’s security forces. Baldo believes that Sudan’s transitional government will be eager to cut ties with the entity. “I believe that these reputational consequences will be a deterrent for the transitional pro-democracy government of Sudan today to continue the type of partnerships that Meroe Gold had with Sudanese security agencies,” Baldo said. “They will be concerned that the U.S. would again be basically unhappy about their continued cooperation with a company of such ill repute on the record in the continent of Africa.” Baldo said the totality of charges show how Russia sought to prop up an autocratic government in Sudan while profiting from the strife. “This is how they are linked to the anti-democracy attempts by a dictatorial regime, a genocidal regime against its own people,” he said.

Comme dans d'autres pays d'Afrique, Moscou mène depuis 2018 une vaste offensive diplomatique et financière dans cette ancienne colonie française plongée dans une guerre civile depuis près de huit ans. La Russie y a livré des armes ces deux dernières années grâce à des assouplissements ponctuels de l'embargo de l'ONU pour le lui permettre. Elle y soutient ouvertement le pouvoir du président Touadéra, qui apparaît comme le favori du scrutin de dimanche pour un second mandat et avec qui elle a signé récemment un accord de coopération militaire. Et y a ouvert en 2019 un bureau militaire formé de quatre généraux russes. Washington demande de la transparence après l'envoi de renforts russes Paramilitaires de Wagner En parallèle, le gouvernement centrafricain a accordé des permis miniers, pour l'exploitation de l'or et du diamant notamment, à des sociétés russes associées à l'homme d'affaires Evguéni Prigojine. Très proche de Vladimir Poutine, il est suspecté d'être le principal financier de Wagner, la société de sécurité privée russe dont les paramilitaires sont très présents en Centrafrique, selon experts, diplomates et ONG. Au moins 175 ""instructeurs militaires"" ont été envoyés depuis 2018, terme utilisé par Moscou pour désigner ces paramilitaires privés, notamment pour former les soldats centrafricains et assurer la sécurité rapprochée de M. Touadéra. Mais, il y a une semaine, quand les plus importants des groupes armés occupant les deux tiers de la Centrafrique ont annoncé qu'ils marchaient sur Bangui à quelques jours des élections, un ou deux avions gros porteurs Antonov ont rapidement débarqué à Bangui au moins ""300 instructeurs militaires"" supplémentaires, a finalement reconnu Moscou après avoir nié qu'il s'agissait de soldats des ""forces régulières"" comme l'avait avancé Bangui. Des soldats rwandais et russes déployés en Centrafrique La Russie n'a pas expressément admis voler au secours du pouvoir mais affirmé avoir seulement envoyé ces renforts pour ""aider"" la Centrafrique ""à renforcer ses capacités défensives"" à l'approche des élections. Depuis, nombre de témoins et humanitaires assurent que ces ""instructeurs"", aux côtés de ceux déjà installés dans le pays, sont au front pour combattre les rebelles. Déjà, mi-octobre, une dizaine de blindés flanqués des drapeaux russe et centrafricain paradaient dans les rues de Bangui, fraîchement débarqués des Antonov en provenance de Moscou pour ""sécuriser"" les élections. Les instructeurs russes sont installés depuis deux ans au palais de Berengo, à une soixantaine de kilomètres de Bangui. ""La Centrafrique n'a pas grand intérêt pour l'État russe"", estime pourtant Roland Marchal, spécialiste de la Centrafrique au Centre de Recherches Internationales (CERI) de Sciences Po à Paris. ""Mais cela permet surtout d'enfoncer un coin dans l'égo des Français"", dans le cadre des désaccords sur la scène internationale entre Moscou et Paris, notamment en Syrie et en Ukraine, explique l'expert. Guerre de ""trolls"" L'ancienne puissance coloniale a perdu du terrain en Centrafrique ces dernières années sur le plan militaire notamment, Paris ayant dû redéployer ses forces pour la lutte contre les jihadistes au Sahel. La Russie a comblé le vide car elle ""présente plusieurs intérêts pour les dirigeants de la Centrafrique"", poursuit M. Marchal: ""c'est un pays qui peut leur fournir des armes, membre du Conseil de sécurité de l'ONU et qui a une expertise dans les domaines minier et pétrolier"".

En octobre, l'ONG américaine The Sentry a dénoncé dans un rapport au vitriol ""des réseaux français et russes œuvrant dans l'ombre des acteurs centrafricains et régionaux pour influencer le processus électoral et faire valoir leurs intérêts économiques et géostratégiques en Centrafrique"", invoquant plus particulièrement Wagner. Trois journalistes russes, qui enquêtaient sur la présence du groupe Wagner en Centrafrique y ont été tués en juillet 2018. L'enquête est aujourd'hui au point mort.

And last week it said it planned to send additional equipment and deploy more instructors, escalating its most significant military foray in Africa in decades. Asked if Russia’s growing influence in CAR was posing a threat to French interests, Parly said: “I will not speak of French interests but of Central African interests”. “Africa belongs to Africans and no one else, no more to the Russians than the French,” she says. “Russia has asserted its presence in the Central African Republic in recent months, it is true, but I am not sure that this presence and the actions deployed by Moscow, like the agreements negotiated in Khartoum at the end of August, help to stabilize the country,” she said. Russia’s foreign ministry had defended its actions against what it said was “a certain ‘jealousy’” by other foreign powers over Russia’s role in CAR. Central African armed groups signed a preliminary agreement at the end of August in Khartoum under the aegis of Russia and Sudan, while the African Union, supported by Paris, was overseeing post-crisis negotiations. France has a military presence in CAR, mainly within the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSCA.

A woman stands near a screen, which displays the logo of VTB Group, at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russia, June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Africa's top copper producer has been hit hard by low commodity prices in recent years. It has only enough foreign currency reserves to cover about three weeks of imports and its franc currency CDF= has lost half its value in the past year. The government is discussing possible assistance with the International Monetary Fund but Western donors are reluctant to aid the government of President Joseph Kabila, who refused to step down when his constitutional mandate expired last December. Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala’s office said in a statement late on Monday that VTB representatives, including Managing Director and Head of African Origination Raymond O’Leary met with Tshibala on Monday to discuss a possible $1 billion investment fund to finance “strategic projects”. The statement cited Albert Yuma, chairman of Congo’s state mining company and president of its chamber of commerce - who organized the meeting with Tshibala - as saying it would be “up to the government to decide how the funds are used”. In a statement, however, VTB said its meetings in Congo were related to advising Congo about “successful future capital raising transactions” and “not with bilateral lending”. Congo has tried to cultivate closer diplomatic ties to Russia amid growing strains in its relationship with the European Union and United States over its failure to organize elections on time and alleged human rights abuses. In March, Congo’s foreign minister Leonard She Okitundu met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, where he offered Lavrov “a box of rare minerals” as a birthday gift, according to the Congolese ministry’s Twitter feed. VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank, is one of several Russian financial institutions the United States sanctioned in 2014 over Moscow’s support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. It was also at the center, along with Switzerland’s Credit Suisse, of $2 billion of loans taken out in secret by the Mozambique government, which has since defaulted on repayment. VTB has denied any wrongdoing relating to the transactions, which IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde described as “clearly concealing corruption” on the part of the Mozambique government.

A total ban on diamond exports from CAR was imposed in 2013 but partially lifted in 2016, allowing CAR to resume sales of diamonds from five “green zones” where the government could certify the stones were conflict-free. As the 2020 chair of the Kimberley Process, an 81-nation body that certifies ethical diamond exports, Russia will focus on helping the CAR government to improve its regulation of local diamond production with the aim of re-entering the export market, Moiseev said. The Kimberley Process group defines conflict diamonds as those whose sales fund armed groups, but a project to broaden the definition is currently underway. Moiseev said current restrictions had not affected CAR’s total output of diamonds, instead increasing the amount of diamonds sold illegally and generating profits for middlemen rather than local communities. “That’s not what we want,” Moiseev said. Russia may play a role in monitoring the situation on the ground as well, should it be invited by Kimberley Process members to do so, Moiseev said, although he added that African countries should lead the way. Russia has been increasing its presence in CAR and across the African continent in recent years, signing multiple military cooperation deals and mining and energy agreements, as well as ramping up trade. Moscow will also push for all Kimberley Process member nations to adopt legislation that distinguishes between natural and synthetic diamonds. It will work on launching an electronic database of certificates that trace the origin of diamonds, helping customers to differentiate between natural and lab-produced stones, Moiseev said. The project could take at least five years, he added. Major diamond miners, however, are increasingly turning to blockchain technology to attach digital fingerprints to diamonds to trace their route from mine to jeweler and ensure their origin is conflict-free.

FILE PHOTO: The Russian Navy's missile corvette Dmitrovgrad sails past the Dvortsoviy Bridge over the Neva River during the Navy Day parade in Saint Petersburg, Russia July 26, 2020. Dmitri Lovetsky/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo The new facility, earmarked to be built in the vicinity of Port Sudan, will be capable of accommodating up to 300 military and civilian personnel and improve Russia’s ability to operate in the Indian Ocean, expanding its influence in Africa. Putin presided over a flagship Russia-Africa summit last year, an event designed to increase Russian sway on the continent, and two nuclear-capable Russian bombers landed in South Africa at the same time in a show of intent. Putin, in a decree published on Monday, said he had approved a Russian government proposal to set up a naval logistics hub in Sudan and ordered the defence ministry to sign an agreement to make it happen. A draft document related to the issue made public earlier this month by the government spoke of a facility that could moor no more than four ships at the same time. The hub would be used for repair and resupply operations and as a place where Russian naval personnel could take rest, it said. The land for the base will be supplied for free by Sudan and Moscow would get the right to bring in any weapons, ammunition and other equipment it needs through Sudan’s airports and ports to support the new facility. Russia has a similar facility at the port of Tartus in Syria, a country where it also operates an air base. Moscow is keen to increase its influence in Africa, a continent with 54 United Nations member states, sprawling mineral wealth, and potentially lucrative markets for Russian-manufactured weapons. It is jockeying for influence and a military foothold in Africa with other nations, including China. Djibouti is home to Chinese, U.S. and French naval bases, while other navies often use its port. The state-controlled TASS news agency has predicted that the new facility will make it easier for the Russian Navy to operate in the Indian Ocean by being able to fly in replacement crews for its long-range ships. It has also forecast that Russia will fortify its new African outpost with advanced surface-to-air missile systems, allowing it to create a no-fly zone for miles around. “Our base in Sudan will be another argument for others to hear us and take heed,” said an opinion piece in TASS about the new facility.

Natalia Seliverstova (mis à jour 15:49 22.12.2020) URL courte Nikita Martynov. Sputnik France https://fr.sputniknews.com/russie/202012221044970512-la-russie-prete-a-envisager-une-assistance-militaire-pour-la-centrafrique-en-cas-de-demande/ À l’approche des élections présidentielle et législatives en République centrafricaine, pays déjà en proie à des tensions, Moscou pourrait envoyer une assistance militaire aux autorités légitimes à leur demande, conformément aux résolutions du Conseil de sécurité de l'Onu. Moscou se dit prêt à examiner la demande d'assistance militaire des autorités légitimes de la République centrafricaine si elle est conforme aux résolutions du Conseil de sécurité de l'Onu, a déclaré à Sputnik le vice-ministre russe des Affaires étrangères Mikhaïl Bogdanov. «S'il y a une telle demande des autorités légitimes. D’ailleurs, elle peut être adressée non seulement à nous, mais à d'autres partenaires et amis», a répondu M.Bogdanov à la question de savoir si la Russie enverra un contingent militaire en Centrafrique. En outre, il a souligné l’importance de la conformité de la demande des autorités aux exigences du Conseil de sécurité de l'Onu, car sur certaines questions, il est nécessaire d'informer le Conseil au moins sous forme de notification. Préoccupé par une tentative de coup d’État Mikhaïl Bogdanov a confirmé qu'il existe un bureau de représentation du ministère russe de la Défense en Centrafrique conformément aux accords internationaux, sans pourtant nier sa participation aux hostilités. Il a également ajouté que Moscou était gravement préoccupé par les tentatives visant à perturber par la force l'élection du chef de l’État. «La tentative d'ingérence forcée dans le processus constitutionnel faite par l'ancien Président, une tentative de perturber les élections: c'est ce qui cause la plus grande inquiétude et préoccupation», a déclaré M.Bogdanov. Auparavant, l'ambassadeur de Russie en Centrafrique, Vladimir Titorenko, avait démenti les informations faisant état du transfert de centaines de soldats russes vers le pays après une tentative de coup d'État dans le pays. Élections à l'agenda Alors que le premier tour des élections présidentielle et législatives est prévu le 27 décembre, mais que l'opposition craint des fraudes massives, la coalition de trois principaux groupes armés occupant la grande majorité du territoire centrafricain et menant une offensive dans le nord et l'ouest du pays menace désormais la capitale Bangui d'un blocus à distance. La Centrafrique a été ravagée par la guerre civile après la chute de François Bozizé en 2013, et les affrontements entre Séléka et milices chrétiennes et animistes antibalaka avaient fait des milliers de morts. ...

The United Nations on Friday said 37 people had been killed, while up to 20,000 were affected, during clashes between Christian and Muslim-dominated militias that saw a church torched in the latest surge of sectarian violence. Death and violence rages on Church sources had previously said a priest was killed in the violence, which sparked on Thursday in the central town of Alindao when Christian militiamen, known as anti-balaka, killed Muslims prompting revenge attacks. This vicious cycle of repeated attacks against civilians is unacceptable. Civilians want security, peace and a future. “This vicious cycle of repeated attacks against civilians is unacceptable. Civilians want security, peace and a future,” said Najat Rochdi, UN humanitarian coordinator in the CAR. Alindao is a stronghold of the Union for Peace in CAR (UPC) Muslim militia that has its roots in the Seleka group. It has witnessed chronic fighting in recent months that has also killed two UN soldiers and a humanitarian aid worker. It lies on a critical route traversing the south and east of the country and is in the heart of a region numerous gold and diamond mines that have helped fuel the conflict. In September, the UN warned of a “disastrous” humanitarian situation in the region, which it said was under the control of armed groups. The CAR conflict One of the world’s poorest nations despite a rich supply of diamonds and uranium, the CAR has struggled to recover from a 2013 civil war that erupted when President Francois Bozize, a Christian, was overthrown by mainly Muslim Seleka rebels. In response, Christians, who account for about 80 percent of the population, organised vigilante units dubbed “anti-balaka”. The state controls only a small part of CAR’s national territory. Armed groups clash in the provinces for control of resources, including diamonds, gold and livestock. The French way The French, who are former colonial masters of CAR, has a military presence in CAR, mainly within the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSCA. It has recently warned aginst increased Russian intervention in the country, urging an African Union initiative or solution to the conflict. “Africa belongs to Africans and no one else, no more to the Russians than the French,” French Defense Minister Florence Parly said last month. The French are working with the African Union in post-crisis negotiations. Sudan mediation, backed by Russia Sudan on the other hand, is working with Russia to resolve the conflict. The former’s president Omar al Bashir on Thursday accused unnamed groups of sabotaging his country’s mediation efforts. Central African armed groups signed a preliminary agreement to cease hostilities, at the end of August in Khartoum under the aegis of Russia and Sudan. “I am not sure that this presence and the actions deployed by Moscow, like the agreements negotiated in Khartoum at the end of August, help to stabilize the country,” France’s Parly said. “Many envy Sudan in his efforts to achieve peace in the region and obstruct its efforts to achieve peace in the Central African Republic,” said al-Bashir during a speech to the conference of the Islamic Movement in Khartoum on Thursday. A planned November 15 peace conference by Kharthoum, was postponed at the request of the African Union which is holding ahead of states summit this weekend. Russia has insisted that its joint peace efforts with Sudan do not contradict with the African Union imitative for peace and reconciliation in the Central African Republic. “It’s a kind of jealousy that we see,” said Russian Deputy Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy. Extending the peacekeeping mission Russia and the United States are reportedly opposed to a draft resolution introduced by France at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, to extend the MINUSCA peacekeeping mission. The United States is keen to reduce expenses and costs of the mission, while France maintains that an African Union-led initiative is “the only framework” for peace in the CAR. The UN has around 12,500 personnel deployed in Central Africa as part of its MINUSCA mission, one of the world body’s largest peacekeeping forces. After heated debates, the security council voted to temporarily renew the mandate of the mission until December. You may also like ",2018-11-17 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-19 03:24:07.632873+00:00,EXTM

62,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/world/europe/russia-central-african-republic-military-accord.html,"Pushing Further into Africa, Russia Signs a New Military Accord Share By Andrew Higgins Aug. 21, 2018 MOSCOW — Just three weeks after three Russian journalists were murdered while investigating the role of Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic, Moscow and the turbulent African country signed an agreement on Tuesday to expand military cooperation. Details of the agreement were not announced but it seemed to relate to Russian military trainers, 175 of whom are already present in the Central African Republic and who were the focus of a daring investigation last month by the Russian journalists. All three, Orkhan Dzhemal, Aleksandr Rastorguev and Kirill Radchenko, died in mysterious circumstances on July 31 in what Russia and the Central African Republic insist was a roadside ambush by unidentified robbers near the town of Sibut. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an exiled Russian oligarch who funds a media organization that sponsored their trip to Africa, has described the official version as “totally unsustainable.” Speaking on Tuesday at a state arms exhibition near Moscow, Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, made no mention of the murdered journalists but was quoted by Russian news agencies as hailing military cooperation with the Central African Republic, a former French colony. He was quoted as saying that the new agreement would “strengthen ties in the defense sphere” between Russia and the central African nation. Marie-Noëlle Koyara, a senior official from the Central African Republic who also attended the Russian arms exhibition, said the accord would enhance the training of her country’s armed forces. Russia, which was deeply involved in Africa during the Cold War, when the East-West rivalry fueled a series of bloody proxy wars, largely retreated from the continent after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Over the past year, however, it has shown a growing desire to return, forging close ties with the Central African Republic, Somalia and South Africa. Russia has said that only five of its instructors in the Central African Republic — some of them based in Sibut, near where the journalists were killed — are military personnel, with the rest civilians. The journalists were trying to determine whether these civilian instructors were in fact working for Wagner, a murky private military contractor founded by a former officer in Russian military intelligence and linked to an associate of President Vladimir V. Putin . Mr. Khodorkovsky, who has lived in exile in London since being released from prison in Siberia in 2013, has vowed to get to the bottom of what happened to the journalists and is now funding a private investigation into the murders. But neither Russia nor the Central African Republic have shown much interest in clarifying why the journalists suddenly changed their plans and decided to leave Sibut after sundown to travel north, instead of waiting until daybreak and traveling east as they had originally intended. Nor why other vehicles traveling on the road where they were killed at around the same time encountered no robbers. The journalists’ African driver, who somehow survived the attack and is the only known witness, has disappeared, variously reported to be in hiding and in custody. Mr. Khodorkovsky has accused the authorities of hiding him to prevent him from revealing what he saw on the night of the murders.

63,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/world/europe/africa-russia-sochi.html,"By Anton Troianovski Oct. 29, 2019 SOCHI, Russia — Jose Matemulane said he left his native Mozambique nearly two decades ago, spent years studying in St. Petersburg and saw the Russian soul. Now he’s in the vanguard of Russia’s new foray onto his home continent, where he is spreading the word that working with Moscow to reduce the influence of Americans and other Westerners is in Africa’s best interests. “The Russians have their own way of thinking different from the Western patterns,” Mr. Matemulane said. “I used to tell people: Russians are nothing else than white Africans, white blacks.” Russia has been playing for power in Africa in recent years by sending arms, offering mercenaries, and cinching mining deals. More quietly, it has started to set up a low-profile infrastructure of political influence that bears echoes of the Kremlin’s strategy in Europe and the United States. And it is already identifying African politicians and activists who will carry its message. Deploying its international propaganda arms, the television channel RT and the Sputnik news agency, the Kremlin is honing this message: While Western Europe and the United States are continuing a centuries-old tradition of exploiting Africa, Moscow is ready to engage with Africa on mutually beneficial terms. Russia is also benefiting from a desire by African countries to lessen their reliance on China, even as Moscow acknowledges that it cannot come close to matching Beijing’s financial firepower. Image The Russia Today studios in London.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Mr. Matemulane runs a think tank called Afric, which describes itself on its website as “funded by donors with a common passion to foster Africa’s development,” without mentioning Russia. In an interview, though, Mr. Matemulane said the group was launched last year with support from a St. Petersburg businessman he declined to name. Afric received prominent billing at a summit for dozens of African leaders hosted by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, and announced it would partner with a Russian propaganda specialist who had previously focused on the United States. It also drew the notice of Mamadou Koulibaly, a candidate for president of Ivory Coast in elections next year. “I will ask them if they can introduce me to people with money who will help me,” Mr. Koulibaly said of Afric. “This is important. A campaign needs money.” Moscow has already injected itself into the geopolitics of Libya and the Central African Republic . Now it is looking for inroads in public opinion and the political elite across the continent. Earlier this year, for example, Russia’s ambassador to Ghana met with Albert Kofi Owusu , the head of Ghana’s main news agency, and discussed a proposal: Might Mr. Owusu distribute stories from Tass, a Russian state-controlled news service, to newspapers, websites and television stations in the West African country? Mr. Owusu said the proposal made sense, especially since his agency was already sharing Chinese state media reports. In October, Mr. Owusu was here on Russia’s glittering Black Sea coast, shaking hands with Mr. Putin. “Very simple man, cool,” is how Mr. Owusu described Mr. Putin, who held a brief meeting at the conference with the heads of 11 African news agencies. Russian officials at the conference said that the Kremlin’s RT and Sputnik would be glad to host African journalists in Moscow for training courses on topics such as social media. Image Mr. Putin posed for a photo with the heads of African news agencies on the sideline of the summit.Credit...Pool photo by Mikhail Metzel “We understand that getting to Moscow costs quite a bit of money, and this may well be too expensive for African newsrooms,” Alexei Volin, Russia’s deputy minister for communications and mass media, added after making the pitch. “We are ready to consider possibilities for RT and Sputnik specialists to organize courses on the ground in this or that African country.” Mr. Volin said RT was ready to provide its suite of documentaries to African TV stations. In addition to animal movies, the library includes features like “Drift It Like Putin’s Driver” and “Coups R Us: American Regime Changes and Their Aftermaths.” Perhaps the most prominent figure in Russia’s Africa push is Yevgeny V. Prigozhin , the St. Petersburg businessman indicted by the United States for running the online “troll farm” that sought to sway the 2016 American presidential election, who is said to run a military contractor called Wagner that is involved in several African countries. Another is Konstantin Malofeev , a nationalist banker under American sanctions who has cultivated ties with far-right politicians in Europe and the United States, as well as pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Prigozhin did not appear in public at the conference, but Mr. Malofeev had a stand right by the entrance showing off a new project: an agency promising to help African governments gain access to financing as an alternative to Western sources like the International Monetary Fund. Image Yevgeny PrigozhinCredit...Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images Mr. Malofeev described the new organization, called the International Agency for Sovereign Development, as an economic approach to the ideological battle he’s been fighting for a long time: breaking the Western world order. But it was the first time he’s ever been involved with Africa, Mr. Malofeev said. Niger, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo have already signed on to have the agency help them raise a total of $2.5 billion, he said. “I oppose liberal totalitarianism,” Mr. Malofeev said in an interview in the private meeting room at his stand, under a portrait of Mr. Putin. “I’m against the global dominance of the Federal Reserve System.” Russia says the yearly volume of its trade with Africa has doubled to $20 billion over the last five years, but that still pales in comparison to Africa’s $300 billion in trade with the European Union and $60 billion with the United States in 2018. In the West, Russia’s messaging has sought to appeal to people disenchanted by the political mainstream — from opponents of immigration and same-sex-marriage on the right to critics of capitalism on the left. In Africa, Russia is similarly trumpeting itself as a protector of “traditional values,” while also seeking to capitalize on Russia’s Cold War past, when the Soviet Union sought to ally itself with opponents of post-colonial influence on the continent. “Our cooperation, rooted in the period of the joint fight against colonialism, is strategic and longstanding,” Mr. Putin told dozens of African leaders in Sochi gathered alongside him around a ring-shaped table. Alexander Malkevich, a veteran of Russia’s propaganda wars, founded an English-language website called USAReally, which tells the story of a declining America caught in the throes of violence. Now, he says, he spends about one-third of his time on Africa. His Foundation for National Values Protection, with a website available in English and French, argues that African countries are vulnerable to the same sort of Western meddling that Russian officials say undermined former Soviet republics like Georgia and Ukraine. “We try to do our work honestly and address our partners with respect, rather than from above, like the caricature of Uncle Sam,” Mr. Malkevich said. Investigative journalists have reported that Afric and Mr. Malkevich’s foundation are funded by Mr. Prigozhin, but Mr. Malkevich and Afric employees denied any connection. Image Alexander Malkevich, a veteran of Russia’s propaganda wars, said he now spends about one-third of his time on Africa.Credit...Elias Williams for The New York Times Afric’s Mozambique-born president, Mr. Matemulane, said it was in fact a different St. Petersburg-based businessman who helped him launch Afric, but declined to identify him. In Sochi, Mr. Malkevich and Mr. Matemulane appeared on a panel together and signed a “cooperation agreement.” “The Western system is broken,” said Clifton Ellis, who is British and Jamaican, and moved to St. Petersburg recently, where he helps coordinate Afric’s activities. “We have to fight the narrative that because Russia is involved, it’s bad.” Afric — an acronym for Association for Free Research and International Cooperation — is building ties with African politicians and commentators while publishing articles that extol the benefits of cooperating with Russia. It has also invested heavily in election monitoring missions that mirror Russia’s approach in its own elections: bringing in sympathetic foreigners who praise the votes’ fairness and transparency, even as established Western organizations criticize them. One of those, Volker Tschapke, the retired president of a small conservative German association called the Prussian Society, extolled Mr. Putin’s re-election vote in March of last year. Since the summer of 2018, Mr. Tschapke has made five separate trips to Africa on behalf of Afric to observe elections in Zimbabwe, Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Mozambique. “It was unimaginably great. In all the countries I visited, I saw truly perfect elections,” said Mr. Tschapke, who acknowledges that he had no experience in election observation until last year. But he says the process is really so simple that “you just need a little instruction.” He added in a telephone interview from Berlin that he had heard rumors that Afric had received Russian start-up funding, but said he had no problem with that. Major elections loom next year across Africa, including in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Burundi. Mr. Koulibaly, the candidate in Ivory Coast presidential elections next October, said he had already met with a Russian deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, as well as with Russian agriculture and mining officials. He said he would talk about Russia in his campaign as a potential economic partner that, for instance, can help Ivory Coast harness nuclear technology. “My experience is that the Russian authorities I meet with want business,” Mr. Koulibaly said. “They don’t talk about ideology. They don’t talk about political control.” African leaders have also taken notice of Russia’s expanded influence in the Middle East as a sign that Moscow is becoming a more formidable geopolitical player. In an interview, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the foreign minister of Djibouti, ticked off countries that he said suffered as a result of misguided Western policies — Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon. “Why shouldn’t we try a new approach? A new message?” Mr. Youssouf said. “Maybe Russia is the alternative.” Advertisement ",2019-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-19 03:38:14.040029+00:00,EXTM
64,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/world/europe/central-african-republic-russia-murder-journalists-africa-mystery-murders-put-spotlight-on-kremlins-reach.html,"In Africa, Mystery Murders Put Spotlight on Kremlin’s Reach Share By Andrew Higgins and Ivan Nechepurenko Aug. 7, 2018 MOSCOW — The three Russian journalists ventured into the violent and rebel-plagued Central African Republic as part of a daring investigation into the Kremlin’s use of mercenaries to project power into Africa, Syria and other distant lands. Three days later, they were dead, supposedly shot by robbers on a road many others traveled that day without incident. The journalists, Orkhan Dzhemal, Aleksandr Rastorguev and Kirill Radchenko, part of an independent Russian news media outfit, had traveled to the former French colony in central Africa, to investigate the activities of the Wagner Group, a private military force founded by a former Russian intelligence officer and linked to an associate of President Vladimir V. Putin. Their murder by unknown assailants not only shines a spotlight on the role of private military contractors, one of the murkiest features of Russia’s effort to reclaim its status as a great power. It also illuminates Russia’s campaign to return to Africa, a zone of particularly violent East-West rivalry during the Cold War that Moscow mostly withdrew from after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia under Mr. Putin has pushed hard to regain a presence in lost territory, asserting itself not only in former Soviet lands like Ukraine but also farther afield in Syria and now Africa, where, during the Cold War, Moscow and the West supported opposing sides in conflicts from the Horn of Africa to Mozambique and Angola. Moscow’s expanding diplomatic, and sometimes military, footprint has also been seen in other African nations, including Sudan, whose leader, Omar al-Bashir, has been ostracized by the West but embraced by the Kremlin. In November, he proposed to Mr. Putin that Moscow build a military base on Sudan’s Red Sea coast. “Russia takes Africa without a fight,” proclaimed a recent analysis of Russia’s strategy in Africa by Ria Novosti, a state news agency in Moscow. The three journalists, whose funerals were held in Moscow on Tuesday, died in what seems to have been a targeted attack while driving after sundown near Sibut, a town 115 miles north of Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, and where, according to a recent United Nations report, Russian military “instructors” have been deployed to support the impoverished republic’s security forces. Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said that Russia had sent 175 such instructors to the Central African Republic — five military personnel and the rest civilians, whose affiliations Russia has not disclosed. While impossible to prove in the chaos of the Central African Republic, several Western experts on Africa said in interviews that they believed that the civilians were affiliated with the Wagner Group, a private security company tied to Yevgeny V. Prigozhin . Image New recruits for the Central African Republic’s armed forces engaged in a drill in Berengo, southwest of Bangui, the country’s capital, last week. Russian military consultants are involved with training the troops.Credit...Florent Vergnes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Mr. Prigozhin is the St. Petersburg businessman close to Mr. Putin who was indicted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for interfering in the 2016 presidential election through his troll factory , the Internet Research Agency. It is unclear whether the Wagner Group — which has no publicly declared telephone number, office or website — is really a private company or, as some experts believe, just a vehicle used by military intelligence for operations that the Russian state wants to keep at arm’s length but which offer moneymaking opportunities for insiders connected to the state. The Russian news media organization that sponsored the journalists’ trip to Africa, the Investigation Control Center, which is funded by the exiled Russian billionaire Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, said that a vehicle carrying the three journalists traveled north from Sibut along with another car but that it was only the journalists’ vehicle that was attacked. The journalists, according to their colleagues in Moscow, had planned to head east from Sibut to a gold mining area near Ndassima where Russians have also been sighted, but instead they abruptly changed their itinerary and drove north instead. The only known witness to what happened on the road — the journalists’ African driver, who somehow survived the attack — has been kept incommunicado by the authorities, adding another layer of mystery to the murder of the Russian journalists and their country’s activities in central Africa. “Many things don’t add up,” said Lewis Mudge, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, who said he had recently driven along the same road where the Russians were killed. The Russian Foreign Ministry, which usually responds with fury to attacks on Russian citizens overseas and vows to hold the culprits responsible, expressed regret over the killings but came close to blaming the victims, stressing that they had not obtained official accreditation and were visiting the Central African Republic as tourists, not reporters. State-controlled media outlets, which serve as a nationalist bullhorn primed to fulminate against any perceived foreign slight against Russian citizens, focused their ire not on the journalists’ killers but on Mr. Khodorkovsky, the self-exiled oligarch whose money helped fund the investigation into the activities of Russian private military contractors like the Wagner Group. The United States Treasury Department last year imposed sanctions against the mercenary company, also known as PMC Wagner, accusing it of recruiting and sending soldiers to fight alongside pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk region of Ukraine. Wagner recruits have also been sent to Syria, where scores and possibly hundreds of them died in February during a firefight with American force s. The often strange story of Russia’s return, after years of absence, to Africa began last October when Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, met in the Russian, Black Sea resort of Sochi with the president of the Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, and discussed, an official statement said, “the considerable potential for partnership in mineral resources exploration” and in other areas of “practical cooperation.” Mr. Touadéra has since appointed a Russian, Valery Zakharov, as his national security adviser. An early sign of where cooperation between the two countries was going came in January when the children of Jean-Bédel Bokassa, the African country’s former dictator, complained of “Russian soldiers” wandering “half-naked” near their father’s tomb in Berengo, southwest of Bangui, the country’s capital. Image From right, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra of the Central African Republic, Defense Minister Marie-Noëlle Koyara and the chargé d’affaires of the Russian Embassy, Viktor Tokmakov, watched military training exercises in Berengo last week.Credit...Florent Vergnes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In a letter of protest issued through a Paris lawyer, the children said that the mysterious Russians had, without permission, set up tents in a derelict palace in Berengo and defiled a memorial shrine to Mr. Bokassa, a brutal ruler trailed by accusations of cannibalism who declared himself emperor of the African nation in 1976. The Berengo encampment was the first stop made by the journalists after their arrival in the Central African Republic at the end of July. They where denied entry by a Russian-speaking African and told to come back after they had obtained official approval for a visit from the Defense Ministry. They never got permission and instead headed north to Sibut, the site of another Russian encampment. Nothing has come to light so far that rules out what Russian and Central African Republic authorities have both said happened on the road from Sibut on the night of July 30: a random attack by violent thieves in a country plagued by violence. But so many Russian journalists at odds with the Kremlin have died in recent years that the killings in central Africa have again generated feverish speculation in Russia about who might be responsible. The finger-pointing has been directed mostly at the Wagner Group, which was the focus of the journalists’ aborted investigation. But that accusation has had to compete with an alternative theory, promoted by an obscure African news media outlet, that France, the republic’s former colonial master, engineered the killings as a warning to Moscow to stay clear of its turf. France for decades regarded its former colony, which gained independence in 1960, as part of its “chasse gardée” — or private reserve — in Africa. It regularly sent troops to Bangui and beyond to protect or topple leaders in the Central African Republic, depending on whether they had found favor or not in Paris. But French primacy and interest have waned in recent years as incessant violence crippled France’s main business venture in the country, a big uranium mine at Bakouma, and led local leaders in Bangui to turn to Moscow for additional protection. The United Nations, which has a peacekeeping force in the Central African Republic, imposed an arms embargo on the country in 2013 but, at Russia’s request, relaxed the blanket ban late last year, and tons of Russian military equipment began arriving at the Bangui airport in January. A United Nations report issued in July said the Russian weapons and ammunition, airlifted to Bangui between Jan. 26 and Feb. 7, were unloaded at the airport by Russian citizens but “given that all the flights reached Bangui after sundown it was not possible to proceed with a proper inspection of the stockpile upon arrival.” The United Nations and other organizations involved in trying to restore order demanded a detailed inspection of the weapons, which were moved to a military base called Camp de Roux in Bangui, to establish exactly what Russian arms and how many had been flown in. “All parties concerned repeatedly committed to facilitating a detailed inspection of the stockpile stored at Camp de Roux in Bangui, but that has not yet taken place,” the July report said. The secrecy surrounding the shipments reinforced concerns among some United Nations officials and Western diplomats that Russia, while perhaps genuinely interested in helping international efforts to stabilize the Central African Republic, also has its own separate agenda.

65,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/russia-facebook-disinformation-africa.html,"Continue reading the main story Russia Tests New Disinformation Tactics in Africa to Expand Influence Facebook said it removed three Russian-backed influence networks aimed at African countries. The activity by the networks suggested Russia’s approach was evolving. Share By Davey Alba and Sheera Frenkel Published Oct. 30, 2019Updated Sept. 1, 2020 Russia has been testing new disinformation tactics in an enormous Facebook campaign in parts of Africa, as part of an evolution of its manipulation techniques ahead of the 2020 American presidential election. Facebook said on Wednesday that it removed three Russian-backed influence networks on its site that were aimed at African countries including Mozambique, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya. The company said the online networks were linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin , the Russian oligarch who was indicted by the United States and accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election . Unlike past influence campaigns from Russia , the networks targeted several countries through Arabic-language posts, according to the Stanford Internet Observatory , which collaborated with Facebook to unravel the effort. Russians also worked with locals in the African countries to set up Facebook accounts that were disguised as authentic to avoid detection. Some of the posts promoted Russian policies, while others criticized French and American policies in Africa. A Facebook page set up by the Russians in Sudan that masqueraded as a news network, called Sudan Daily, regularly reposted articles from Russia’s state-owned Sputnik news organization. The effort was at times larger in volume than what the Russians deployed in the United States in 2016. While the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency posted on Facebook 2,442 times a month on average in 2016, one of the networks in Africa posted 8,900 times in October alone, according to the Stanford researchers. “They are trying to make it harder for us and civil society to try and detect their operations,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, said of the Russian actions. The campaign underlined how Russia is continuing to aggressively try different disinformation techniques, even as it has come under scrutiny for its online interference methods. By spreading the use of its tactics to a region that is less closely monitored than the United States and Europe, researchers said Russia appeared to be trying to expand its sphere of influence in Africa, where it has started distributing propaganda and building a political infrastructure . Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and a former Facebook executive, said the campaign had implications for the United States ahead of next year’s presidential election. He said it was highly likely that Russian groups were already using the same model of working with locals in the United States to post inflammatory messages on Facebook. By employing locals, he said, Russians did not need to set up fake accounts or create accounts that originated in Russia, making it easier to sidestep being noticed. “We will see a model where American groups are used as proxies, where all the content is published under their accounts and their pages,” Mr. Stamos said. Image A Facebook page for Sudan Daily, which was part of a Russian-backed influence network, funneled users to a Sudan Daily website that reposted articles from the Russian government-run news agency Sputnik.Credit...Stanford Internet Observatory For Facebook, the evolution of Russia’s disinformation techniques means it cannot afford to lose vigilance. The Silicon Valley company faced a barrage of criticism after Russians abused the social network in 2016 to plant divisive content to influence the American electorate. Since then, Facebook has set up war rooms and hired more security experts to head off foreign interference in elections. But Russia has kept up a steady stream of influence efforts on Facebook. Last week, the company revealed it had taken down four state-backed disinformation campaigns , three from Iran and one of which started in Russia. Facebook is dealing with other issues related to the 2020 election. For weeks, it has been under attack by presidential candidates , lawmakers and even its own employees over how it treats political advertising. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has said he will allow politicians to post any claims they want in an ad — even if they are false — in the name of free expression . Facebook faces a difficult adversary in Russia. The country had previously indicated that its disinformation techniques were changing and that it was aiming to work with locals on online influence campaigns. In Ukraine, which held a presidential election this year, local authorities announced in March that they had arrested a Russian agent in the capital, Kiev. The agent, they said, had been ordered by his Russian handlers to “find people in Ukraine on Facebook who wanted to sell their accounts or temporarily rent them out.” The latest campaign in Africa is the first well-documented case of Russia “franchising,” or outsourcing, its disinformation efforts to local parties, said Facebook and the Stanford researchers. It’s unusual for a nation to try to influence so many countries at once, they said. Shelby Grossman, one of the Stanford researchers, said that Russians in some cases set up local media organizations in the African countries to employ locals who would post the propaganda and false content on Facebook. In other cases, the Russians hired existing media groups to do so. Facebook said it was unclear specifically when the Russian activity in Africa started because the Russians took over some existing pages on the social network. But the posts ramped up last year when the influence networks bought Facebook ads. In total, the networks spent more than $87,000 on Facebook ads. The networks often posted about political news, including elections in Madagascar and Mozambique. They sought to drive Facebook users from the platform and into public groups on WhatsApp and Telegram, which are encrypted messaging apps, to increase interaction. And they used Facebook Live videos, Google Forms and quizzes to draw people into their Facebook pages and groups. Some of the Facebook pages pushing Russian disinformation were not sophisticated. A cluster of pages posing as Libyan news entities posted about Libyan issues, but the page managers were in Egypt, the Netherlands, Germany and other countries, said the Stanford researchers. Some of the pages experienced unnatural jumps in followers and other telltale signs of inauthentic behavior. Mr. Gleicher said some of the Russian-run pages and groups also used compromised Facebook accounts that once belonged to real people but had been stolen and repurposed by hackers. He said that Facebook is still building out its automated systems for detecting compromised accounts, so the company still misses some and pulls in its investigative team to catch them. Facebook said its investigation had “connected these campaigns to entities associated with” Mr. Prigozhin, but the company declined to say how. Mr. Prigozhin controlled the entity that financed Russia’s Internet Research Agency. In all, the social network said it took down 66 accounts, 83 pages, 11 groups and 12 Instagram accounts related to the Russian campaign. Mr. Gleicher said hundreds of thousands of Facebook accounts followed the pages, groups and Instagram accounts. Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at the social media analytics company Graphika, said Russia’s new tactics revealed the “dirty tricks and black ops that are underpinning the Russian outreach in Africa.” He called it “the new KGB playbook for foreign influence.” Advertisement ",2019-10-30 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-19 03:38:15.782556+00:00,EXTM
66,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/02/c_137010762.htm,"Chinese firm to help Costa Rica expand key highway Source: Xinhua| 2018-03-02 12:53:14|Editor: Jiaxin Video PlayerClose SAN JOSE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese construction firm is set to help Costa Rica expand an artery highway to improve its transport capacity and efficiency, and spur local economy in general. Financing from the Chinese government is helping fund the modernization of the route 32, connecting the capital San Jose with the Caribbean town of Puerto Limon, where two port terminals, Limon and Moin, together handle as much as 80 percent of all Costa Rican imports, and exports to the U.S. East Coast, Europe and South America. The China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), which operates in more than 80 countries around the world, has already begun laying the groundwork. Despite its strategic role in trade, Route 32 has over the years fallen into disrepair, especially due to increasing passenger and cargo traffic in Limon and the capital. Traffic along the 127.2 km two-lane blacktop is easily disrupted by roadway accidents or other unforeseen events, making expansion of the highway necessary. Costa Rica's deputy minister of Public Works and Transport, Guiselle Alfaro, said Route 32 will see even more traffic when the new container terminal at Moin opens in a year. ""This route is going to move all the cargo from Moin ... and that has saturated the route's capacity for heavy cargo. It also makes things difficult for those carrying light cargo. That's why it is essential to separate cargo with two (added) lanes,"" said Alfaro. The revamped four-lane highway is expected to have a positive impact in other areas, including the environment, by making it more efficient to ship goods and traffic accidents. ""The project is also going to improve pedestrian safety with some features. It is going to improve intersections, and in general it will cut down on shipping time. The benefits for our country are enormous,"" said Alfaro. Wang Bingbing, assistant director of projects at CHEC, said the proposed design is still pending final approval, but preparatory work on the expansion began in December 2017, including transporting construction machinery and equipment to the site. To minimize environmental damage, ""the CHEC is cooperating with a renowned environmental consulting firm in Costa Rica and we are employing many environmental engineers to guide us,"" said Wang. Alfaro acknowledged the CHEC's willingness to fulfill all of the country's stringent environmental norms. ""We have noticed the great effort and performance of the CHEC. They have tried to overcome all of the existing cultural differences and they have done their best to comply with our regulations, mainly regarding the environment,"" said Alfaro. Costa Rican business owners who depend on agile imports or exports are anxiously awaiting the project's completion, including Ricardo Mora, owner of El Lagar, a well-known chain of hardware stores.

For example, Solis said, the China International Import Expo to be held in Shanghai in November will be an extraordinary opportunity for countries across the world to show their commitments to globalization. ""There is no doubt that the Import Expo will be a crucial occasion for the reactivation of international programs favoring trade,"" he said, adding that the event will be of the highest importance for ties between China and Latin America. Costa Rica has a great variety of high-quality products to be showcased, which, together with the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries, make the country's presence in Shanghai a priority in its trade agenda this year, Solis said. China and Costa Rica signed the FTA in 2010. Noting that Costa Rica has already exported pineapples, pork and shrimps to China, the president called on more companies to attend the event. ""We are certain that the export of high-quality products from Costa Rica to China will dramatically increase,"" he said. ""Costa Rica has a solid trading platform (with China) and it also sustains an important political dialogue on issues of common interest,"" he added. Solis said Costa Rica also plays an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative. Proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative aims to achieve infrastructure, trade and people-to-people connectivity along and beyond the ancient Silk Road trade routes, building a new platform for international cooperation to create new drivers of growth. China has important projects in Costa Rica such as the building of the national stadium, the national police academy, and Route 32 that connects the capital San Jose to the main port of Puerto Limon, Solis said. Costa Rica has invested over 1 billion U.S. dollars in a new container terminal in this port, which will help promote the country's future development, he pointed out. Solis said he believes that the country's relations with China will remain positive in the years to come. ""Costa Rica can learn from China's best practices in the building of ports, airports, highways and other infrastructure projects,"" he said, adding the two countries should also strengthen cooperation in trade and science and technology. Costa Rica must make full use of the FTA with China and make China a trading partner of top priority, Solis said.

70,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/13/world/asia/13costa.html,"By Graham Bowley Sept. 12, 2008 As part of an incentive package to persuade Costa Rica to shift its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China last year, China used the muscle of its enormous foreign exchange reserves, agreeing to buy $300 million of Costa Rican bonds, documents released in Costa Rica this week revealed. The deal shows that China is using its $1.8 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, the world’s largest such cache of foreign currency, to further its political goals, despite promises that it would not do so. As China’s economic might has risen in recent years, so has concern about its international reach, particularly in the United States. China is thought to be the largest foreign holder of United States government-backed debt, and bankers estimate that $1 trillion of China’s total foreign exchange reserves are in American securities. The terms of the agreement were meant to be kept secret, according to La Nación, a Costa Rican newspaper, but the government was forced by the constitutional court to publish the memorandum of understanding signed by both countries, as well as other documents. The court considered the information to be in the public’s interest. The memorandum, posted on the Web site of Costa Rica’s Foreign Ministry, is dated June 1, 2007, the month that China and Costa Rica established diplomatic relations, and it is co-signed by Yang Jiechi, China’s foreign minister. The memorandum states that in return for Costa Rica’s shutting its embassy in Taiwan and expelling Taiwanese diplomats, China agreed to buy $300 million in bonds. It also agreed to give $130 million in aid to Costa Rica, as well as other incentives, including 20 scholarships each year for Costa Ricans to study in China. The documents show that the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the secretive organization that is the steward of China’s foreign exchange reserves, agreed to buy $150 million in state bonds, with a term of 12 years and carrying an interest rate of 2 percent per year, in January of this year and a further $150 million in January 2009. La Nación reported that the Costa Rican finance minister, Guillermo Zúñiga, had warned this week that the decision to make the details of the agreement public could jeopardize the purchase of the second set of bonds by China. It quoted the Chinese ambassador to Costa Rica, Wang Xiaoyu, as saying that China was now assessing the impact on relations between the countries. In a statement published Wednesday, Vice President Laura Chinchilla defended the agreement. “We believe that the country received only positive news with the establishment of this relationship,” she said. China’s ruling Communist Party considers Taiwan, a democracy of 23 million, a rebel province that must be brought back into the fold. China has threatened to use force to reclaim Taiwan if it takes steps to formalize its de facto independence from the mainland. China for years has devoted considerable diplomatic energy and financial resources to persuading other countries to sever ties with Taiwan. After Costa Rica’s switch to China last year, Taiwan was left with only a small circle of 23 international supporters, most of them tiny, poor nations, while Beijing commands the support of 171 nations. China has also worked to block Taiwan from joining certain international bodies, like the World Health Organization. Both sides have vied for friends with lavish offers of financial aid and infrastructure projects, but the involvement of the foreign exchange administration in providing a lure is a new one. The revelation that the foreign exchange administration had used funds under its supervision to achieve China’s diplomatic goals may complicate the agency’s efforts to broaden and diversify the investment of China’s largely dollar-based foreign currency holdings. Both the foreign exchange administration and the China Investment Corporation, a state-run investment fund that has a separate role in investing China’s foreign-currency holdings in overseas assets, are eager to find new, more lucrative outlets for earning profits in dollar-based investments. But politicians in the United States have raised concerns that China could use such investments as leverage to realize political and diplomatic goals that sometimes clash with Washington’s priorities.

In a country mired in conflict and poverty, the flash of cameras capturing the moment a young woman was crowned the nation's glamour queen was a moment to savour. But for Western observers, the contest also marked the latest subtle shift in a regional power dynamic. In their eyes, Russia's funding of the event signalled a bid to boost its clout in the former French colony, deploying people-pleasing ""soft power"" as well as military aid. In the capital's crumbling 20,000-seat main stadium at the weekend, about 100 people - mostly state officials and the families of contestants - watched the women parade in high heels alongside Russian flags adorning the venue's walls. Lobaye Invest, a diamond mining firm reputedly close to the Kremlin, featured prominently on the billboards of event sponsors. ""To our dear friends from Russia, we wish to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the support you are bringing to every level of our society,"" said the show's top producer, Lea Floride Mokodopo, who then gave a warm welcome to Elmira Abdrazakova, Miss Russia 2013. _______________ Sudanese militias moonlight as poachers in Central African Republic's badlands _______________ Russia's influence in CAR has been growing ever since the UN-backed government last year called for help to fight militias rampaging through the country. Since then, Moscow has supplied weapons, military officers, 170 military ""trainers"" and a security advisor to work with President Faustin-Archange Touadera - a significant deployment to a country historically linked to France and which already has EU and UN aid. The military trainers sent by Russia are mercenaries with close ties to Russian mining companies and the numbers deployed could be significantly higher, according to Western sources. At the contest, Miss Russia 2013 presented a cheque for five million CFA francs ($8,650) to support a local health centre and made a speech referencing Russia's political push in the CAR. ""The recently signed Khartoum declaration is a pledge of peace,"" Ms Abdrazakova said. Initiated by Russia in August, the ""declaration"" came after Russia and Sudan hosted talks in the Sudanese capital Khartoum with some of CAR's rival militias. The talks took place separately from an African Union initiative, with both attempting to convince CAR's rival groups to end the violence that spiralled after the 2013 overthrow of longtime leader Francois Bozize. The Miss Central African Republic 2018 contestants wait for the jury's verdict in an evening gowns during the beauty pageant. AFP Most of the country is controlled by armed groups, many of which claim to protect Christian or Muslim communities, and which often fight over resources including gold, copper, iron ore and uranium. In a sign of Western wariness towards Russia's actions, France's Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly on Tuesday emphasised the importance of countries working with the African Union in CAR. ""The positive contribution by a number of countries, including Russia, should be in line with the African initiative for peace supported by the AU,"" she said. Ms Parly was in Bangui for ceremonies in which France handed over 1,400 Kalashnikov assault rifles and three amphibious vehicles to CAR's poorly-equipped army. The French-supplied weapons follow 1,700 Kalashnikovs provided by Russia in January. Both shipments have been approved by a UN panel that issues exemptions to a global arms embargo against the CAR.

Share What Are Russian Military Contractors Doing In The Central African Republic? share Print The three Russian journalists who were killed in the Central African Republic (CAR) this week had arrived in the war-torn country to investigate the reported presence there of a shadowy Russian paramilitary force whose units are said to have fought in Ukraine and Syria. Colleagues of Orkhan Dzhemal, Aleksandr Rastorguyev, and Kirill Radchenko say the trio were making a documentary about the private Russian military company Vagner, which French and Russian media reports had previously reported to be operating in the CAR. CAR officials say the journalists were ambushed and killed by unidentified assailants. The Russian government has never officially confirmed the presence of Vagner employees in the African country and denies that the firm's contractors act on Moscow's orders. The private military firm is reportedly controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a longtime associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, though Prigozhin has previously denied that he is linked to the company. Here are five things you need to know about Russian military contractors working in the CAR. Why Are Russian Contractors There? The Central African Republic, one of the world's poorest countries, has been subjected to a UN Security Council arms embargo since 2013, when an armed, mainly Muslim coalition known as Seleka seized power. Christian armed formations fought back, and the violence saw thousands killed and hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes. The president of the Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadera In 2016, Faustin-Archange Touadera was elected president of the CAR, but much of the country remains controlled by various armed formations, primarily ex-Seleka fighters and the Christian alliance known as Anti-balaka. The UN established a peacekeeping mission in the CAR in 2014. In December 2017, Russia secured an exemption to the Security Council arms embargo, allowing Moscow to deliver arms and training for what a UN panel of experts describes as part of a multinational effort -- including the European Union Military Training Mission -- to boost the capabilities of the CAR's military and security forces. ""Our only request was that the Russian delegation submit additional information on the serial numbers of the weapons…so that we can track weapons going into CAR,"" AFP cited an unidentified U.S. official as saying at the time. How Many Are There, And What Are They Doing? In December, Russia notified the Security Council committee overseeing the CAR arms embargo of the involvement of 175 Russian ""instructors"" in a training mission, according to a report by a UN panel of experts issued last week. Of those personnel, 170 were identified as civilian instructors, while the remaining five were from the Russian military, the report says. According to the panel, Russian instructors have been involved in a range of tasks, including: escorting convoys of building materials for hospitals; providing security for hospitals donated by Russia; and training police officers as a requirement for equipping them with Russian weapons. The panel also said that a Russian national had been appointed as a national security adviser to Touadera and that the Russian is ""engaging with armed groups"" to discuss issues including ""disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, national reconciliation,"" and the sharing of revenue derived from the exploitation of natural resources. In June, two government soldiers and one Russian instructor were wounded in an attack by militia fighters while traveling to the south of the country, the panel said. Why Is Vagner Said To Be Operating In The CAR? Several media reports over the past year have indicated that Vagner contractors may be working in the CAR. In March, a reporter for the Russian news site Znak.com visited a facility reportedly operated by Vagner outside the southern Russian city of Krasnodar. The reporter cited a military veteran who lives in the town where the facility is located as saying that Vagner mercenaries were set to be sent ""to Africa"" for a ""training"" mission. Two weeks later, the Russian Foreign Ministry publicly discussed the 175 Russian ""instructors,"" saying they had been sent to the CAR in ""late January-early February,"" but without indicating whether the civilian personnel were employees of Vagner or another military contractor. A memorial at the Central House of Journalists in Moscow to the three Russians killed in the CAR. The Russian investigative journalism news site The Bell in June cited an unidentified source as saying that Vagner employees were training CAR forces. And last month, Yevgeny Shabayev, a leader of a Cossack organization who says he visited Vagner fighters injured in a deadly February clash with U.S. forces in Syria, published a letter stating that private Russian military contractors have operated in the CAR and ""an array of other African and Arab countries.""* An editor at the Investigation Control Center, the outlet funded by billionaire Kremlin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky that financed the investigation conducted by the three journalists killed in the CAR, said on August 1 that the team had reached the facility where they believed Vagner operatives were stationed but were told they needed accreditation from the country's Defense Ministry. What Is Russia's Interest? Russia says it is seeking to restore peace in the CAR with the provision of arms and training to government forces. ""Russia's assistance is carried out as part of the common efforts of the international community to strengthen the national security units of CAR,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Artyom Kozhin said in a March 22 statement. But Moscow has also made no secret of its economic interests in the country's natural resources. ""Russia is exploring the possibilities of the mutually beneficial development of Central African natural resources,"" Kozhin said. ""The prospecting-mining exploration concessions began in 2018. We believe these projects will help stabilize the economic situation in CAR, promote the construction of the infrastructure, and serve as a basis for drawing additional investment to the country's economy."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with Touadera in the Russian city of Sochi in October, with the ministry saying that the officials ""reaffirmed their countries' resolve"" to bolster bilateral ties ""and pointed to the considerable potential for partnership in mineral resources exploration"" and energy. Putin met Touadera in St. Petersburg in May , with the Russian leader saying that Moscow ""will be happy to consider various plans to boost our relations, first of all in the economic and humanitarian fields."" What Impact Is Russian Presence Having? While Russia touts its weapons shipments and training efforts in the CAR as an effort to stabilize the country, the report by the UN panel of experts released last week said that new weapons obtained by government forces have motivated rebel militias to boost their own stockpiles. ""The recent acquisition of weaponry by the Government has created an incentive for the active rearmament of ex-Selaka factions,"" the report said. The panel added that armed militia representatives had told them that ""since the government had opted for the military option (training, rearming, and attacking) instead of the political process, armed groups needed to be prepared."" The experts' report noted a worsening of the security situation in Bangui and Bambari, citing ""serious outbreaks of violence, including in areas where the situation had previously improved."" *Correction: This article has been amended to clarify that Yevgeny Shabayev's letter stated that private Russian military contractors, not necessarily Vagner, have operated in the Central African Republic.

82,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-in-africa/4653190.html,"From the CAR to Eritrea, Russia’s African Ambitions Unfold By Salem Solomon November 10, 2018 05:49 PM Share on Facebook Share via Email Print this page Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, shakes hands with Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera, in St. Petersburg, Russia, Wednesday, May 23, 2018. WASHINGTON - The Central African Republic might seem like an unusual venue for Russia’s evolving strategy in Africa. The CAR doesn’t boast Ethiopia’s booming economy or Angola’s deep oil reserves. It lacks a developed mining industry like Zambia or a strategic location like Djibouti. But the landlocked country of fewer than 5 million people, most of whom survive on subsistence farming, has something else of interest to Moscow: conflict. Since 2013, the CAR has grappled with a protracted civil war . Mass displacements, political instability, and competing factions of rebels and militia groups have weakened the government and eroded peoples’ trust in its institutions. In the ensuing volatility, Russia has found opportunities to project power far beyond its borders and rekindle strategic partnerships in Africa that have been dormant since the end of the Cold War. After Decades-Long Hiatus, Russia Seeks Renewed Africa Ties Russia has re-emerged as a potential player in Africa after a 20-year hiatus, but the consequences of their comeback aren’t yet clear. ‘Armed adventurism’ Russia has stepped up its presence in the CAR in the past few years. But its strategies there, which rely on the use of private contractors and mercenary groups, have been employed since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s and, later, in Ukraine and Syria. “We should think about mercenaries as an instrument which allows plausible deniability but also hard-power projection, which has multiple uses in contested areas,” said Kiril Avramov, a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin’s Intelligence Studies Project. Avramov told VOA’s Russian service that Moscow officially bans mercenaries and security companies, but ex-military or intelligence officers often organize them, providing close ties to the Kremlin. Their work, which Avramov called “armed adventurism,” has helped Russia rebound from isolation and advance its political objectives. One company, Wagner Group, has come under increasing scrutiny. This summer, three journalists investigating Wagner’s operations in the CAR were ambushed and killed. Footage captured by the journalists suggests Wagner may have been assisting both the government and rebels. Marie-Noëlle Koyara, the CAR’s minister of defense, told VOA’s French-to-Africa service that the Russian journalists had not secured appropriate media credentials from the Ministry of Communication. “All who arrive here to cover news, no matter what event, they are always welcome, but they have to respect the procedure,” Koyara said. She hopes authorities can piece together what happened to the slain journalists “to take away lessons.” “We would really like to know the true cause of these assassinations,” Koyara said. ‘Club of illiberals’ For Russia, private military contractors complement a broader strategy focused on strengthening state sovereignty, Avramov said. “The current Kremlin is trying to export counterrevolution,” he added. Rather than destabilize regimes, Russia looks for countries already besieged, from the CAR to Syria. These governments welcome help, Avramov said, and that provides Russia with multiple opportunities, from weapons deals to training programs. In the CAR, Moscow has gone a step further, cementing deals for political consultations, joint foreign operations and security details for the president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra. In the future, mineral mining might present opportunities to “entrepreneurs and their little private armies,” Avramov said, even if the sector is currently underdeveloped. But the country may be getting more than it bargains for. “You’re going to get what I call the ‘club of illiberals.’ You buy insurance, and then you receive a package,” Avramov said. That package includes mercenary groups, such as Wagner, which often have ties to both oligarchs and political elites. “You somehow start losing a grasp (on) where the private ends and the state begins,” Avramov said. Countries also can end up pawns in Russia’s geopolitical ambitions. In the CAR, Russia is “playing in the backyard of France and trying to sow division with the neighbors,” Avramov said. And while Russia may not want the countries with which it aligns to plummet into chaos, quick resolutions to the battles it inserts itself into aren’t desirable, either. Drawn-out conflict means more time to sell arms, secure energy contracts and counterbalance China. Despite outpacing Russia in political alliances and economic deals, Beijing faces real competition from Moscow, Avramov said. Compared to China, “(Russia) is punching above its weight, and it’s doing it in a very spectacular manner,” he added. Logistics facility Two thousand kilometers from the CAR, Moscow sees opportunities in another country dealing with the fallout of war. Eritrea, in East Africa, emerged this summer from decades of active conflict with Ethiopia, followed by 20 years of isolation. In August, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed plans to build a logistics center at the Port of Assab, in southern Eritrea, during a meeting with a high-level Eritrean delegation, according to RIA, a Russian state-owned news agency. Russia-Eritrea Relations Grow with Planned Logistics Center Russia and Eritrea expanded their diplomatic relationship when Moscow announced plans to build a logistics center at a port in the East African country.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov disclosed the plans at a meeting with a high-level delegation from Eritrea, according to RIA, a Russian state-owned news agency.The scope, location and timeline of the project have not been announced. Avramov said it makes sense for Russia to pursue the base, along with similar partnerships. “We will see those activities on the rise,” he said, citing Russia’s desire for recognition as a world superpower and its need for diplomatic relationships. Countries steeped in conflict give Moscow a chance to develop a longterm presence, Avramov added, despite limited resources. They also give the Kremlin a chance to send a message, both to China and the West. “It’s a way of saying, ‘If you’re criticized for your human rights record, if you’re criticized for any of the things the West clings on, here is always another option,’” Avramov said.

AP / Cassandra Vinograd Get all our news and commentary in your inbox at 6 a.m. ET. email Ideas Russia Is Back In Africa — and Making Some Very Odd Deals Since December, Moscow has struck major deals in the Central African Republic with both government and rebel leaders. Russia After largely withdrawing from Africa in the wake of the Soviet collapse, Russia is starting to return to the continent in surprising ways. Since December, Moscow has struck major deals in the Central African Republic (CAR) with the government and rebel leaders, raising questions about its intentions in the troubled African nation. In December, Russia asked the U.N. Security Council to let it supply weapons to CAR’s new EU-trained army. After some objections by France, Russia secured an exception to the U.N. arms embargo, and began shipping weapons in January . By year’s end, Russia intends to deliver 5,200 rifles, a variety of other light weapons, and some 170 civilian instructors. In late March, CAR president Faustin-Archange Touadéra appeared in public with a Russian personal guard , a supplement to the Rwandan bodyguards assigned to him by the U.N. peacekeeping mission. At least 40 Russian Special Forces troops — and perhaps mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked Wagner group — are in-country to protect the president, with more reportedly on the way. Presidential spokesperson Albert Yaloke-Mokpem told Jeune Afrique that the Russians “work at all levels and are there to observe and train the presidential guard.” President Touadéra has a number of incentives to work with Russia rather than France or the United States. Russia’s aid in arming the CAR’s military is a huge boon for the chronically underfunded state. The EU training mission in CAR has been agonizingly slow, leaving an underequipped and undertrained military to face a deteriorating security situation. Russian instructors, while certainly less concerned with the moral or ethical dilemmas of war, may give Touadéra the military he needs to combat the rebel groups across the country. The presence of Russian guards also helps protect the President from coup or assassination. In April, an armed group attacked the U.N. base near the Presidential residence, likely in retaliation for U.N. and Central African efforts to uproot the militias hiding in the capital city of Bangui. It seems the clash spooked the president. His personal guard have stepped up patrols in the area and he’s requested even more Russian Special Forces troops. The President is also mistrustful of the Western military presence in the country. While the U.N. and Central African forces battle armed groups in the capital and further afield, the President’s team is more concerned with resisting the West. The international community’s support for Touadéra has been flagging due to the slow progress of the country’s reconstruction, and his cabinet has taken it to heart. One presidential adviser told Jeune Afrique that he thinks “westerners are able to organize the fall of Touadéra” and coyly indicated that the president is “conscious of the things that are being engineered against him.” The situation is a win-win from Touadéra’s perspective: Russia gains regional influence and the President feels secure from the perceived threat of the U.N. But Touadéra may have more to fear from the Russians than he thinks. From January to March, Russian officials met with at least three major rebel leaders in the country. Two of them —Michel Djotodia, a former president of CAR; and Noureddine Adam, who leads the Renaissance of the Central African Republic group — are currently subject to sanctions from the United States and U.N. respectively for their roles in the 2013 coup d’état and subsequent reign of terror that brought about the country’s current humanitarian crisis. If the Russians are pinning their aspirations on Touadéra, then Moscow’s cooperation with the President’s enemies is strange indeed. It could be economics. Rebel groups control most of the country, including areas rich in oil, uranium, and diamonds. Indeed, Djotodia’s March meeting with the Russians reportedly concerned access to platinum and mercury deposits on his land. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement indicating that Moscow intended to work with the government to secure mining concessions, but since Touadéra is unlikely to negotiate peace or retake the land outright, Russia may be attempting to acquire the resources it desires through other means. On the other hand, Russia’s actions put it in a unique position to wield political influence in the country. By arming the country’s military, conducting business deals with rebel groups and ensuring the personal safety of the President, Russia can now pursue its interests, financial or otherwise, much more effectively. Unlike other actors in the region such as Rwanda or Chad, Russia’s engagement is independent of the U.N. and will have a freer hand to operate or play kingmaker if the peacekeeping mission withdraws. Russia’s destabilizing presence is a cause for concern for American policymakers. At a time when U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley seeks to dramatically cut the peacekeeping budget, the mission to CAR — the U.N.’s third intervention in 20 years — has proven to be a money sink. The already precarious security situation also leaves the country unprepared to deal should a deepening Ebola outbreak in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo cross the border. An unstable CAR also provides a haven for armed groups such as Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army, a terrorist group the U.S. has been hunting since 2008, and the Janjaweed Militias, which perpetrated much of the violence in the Darfur region of Sudan. Rebel groups from neighboring Chad — a key counterterror partner for the U.S. in Africa — also frequently hide in CAR to gather strength. It is unclear how France, which has even more interest in CAR’s affairs, will respond to these events. The former colonial power has been politically active in CAR since the country’s independence, and was one of the key actors in the country after the U.N. unseated Djotodia in 2014. But two years later, France withdrew most of the soldiers that had been supporting the U.N. mission in CAR, although some 900 remain as a “rapid-reaction” force, ostensibly to assist the U.N. as necessary. France apparently tried to supply weapons to the CAR government, but was denied an exception to the U.N. embargo by Russia, who offered their own arms instead. France may be concerned that Russia will challenge its position as CAR’s unofficial patron, but the French may also be timid about asserting itself in the current political climate. The French Embassy in CAR was forced to release a statement this week expressing its full support for the U.N. after armed groups in the capital city of Bangui began hanging French flags and handing out flyers announcing that they were fighting the U.N. peacekeepers with French political support. Cognizant of the attention French action receives in its former colonies, the French may not overtly oppose Russia’s growing influence for some time. Moscow’s intentions in CAR are still unclear. Supporting both the government and the rebels puts Russia in a prime position to wield influence in the country, but there does not seem to be an obvious reason to support both when backing either one could gain Russia access to the country’s minerals. Whatever Moscow’s endgame might be, capitalizing on CAR’s insecurity and the international community’s inaction is giving Russia unprecedented influence in a country traditionally aligned with the West and rich in natural resources.

The loan was mentioned in a quarterly VTB financial report published by the Russian central bank. The report included a table listing the outstanding financial claims that VTB group had on dozens of countries as of Oct. 1 this year. In the table next to Central African Republic was the sum of 801,933,814,000 roubles ($12 billion) — more than six times the country’s annual economic output. We are members of the IMF (International Monetary Fund). When a member of the IMF wants to take on debt ... it has to discuss that with the IMF When asked about the data by Reuters, the bank said the loan to the former French colony did not, in reality, exist. “VTB bank has no exposure of this size to any foreign country. Most likely, this is a case of an operational mistake in the system when the countries were being coded,” the lender said in a statement sent to Reuters. VTB did not say who was responsible for the mistake or how such a large figure could have been published without being spotted. CAR government spokesman Ange Maxime Kazagui, when asked about the Russian data, said: “I don’t have that information. But it doesn’t sound credible because $11 billion is beyond the debt capacity of CAR.” “We are members of the IMF (International Monetary Fund). When a member of the IMF wants to take on debt … it has to discuss that with the IMF.” There was no indication in the data published by the Russian central bank of who was the recipient of the loan, the purpose of the loan, or when it was issued and on what terms. CAR is a nation of 5 million people emerging from sectarian conflict, with a gross domestic product of $1.95 billion, according to the World Bank. Russia has built up security and business ties with CAR in the past few years.

85,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://thedefensepost.com/2018/05/09/russia-central-african-republic-pmc-opinion/,"Africa Commentary War Expanding global footprint: Russia builds on Syria experiments in Central Africa Kiril Aramov and Ruslan Trad take an in-depth look at Russia’s expansion of its burgeoning hybrid state, as it moves private military contractors into the Central African Republic Opinion Editor May 9, 2018 8 minutes read Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit WhatsApp Telegram Share via Email Print By Kiril Avramov and Ruslan Trad The recent news and subsequent investigative analysis regarding the nature and scope of the military cooperation between Russia and the Central African Republic reads like a sensation but actually should not come as a surprise at all for most seasoned Russia watchers. The shipment of Russian light arms and munitions along with five military and 170 civilian instructors to CAR upon President Faustin Archange Touadera’s request after his 2017 meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Sochi should be perceived as strategic maneuvering and messaging in several important aspects. The first is that the provision of armaments, special forces and possibly mercenaries deployed under the guise of civilian instructors from Russia to CAR is a part of an emerging trend that stretches from Libya and Egypt through Sudan and possibly other African countries . Second, it signals a significant shift in the Russian approach outside the “near abroad.” If in the cases of the former Yugoslavia, Eastern Ukraine and most notably Syria, the deployment of private military contractors and their interaction with regular forces on the ground was an experiment to see how this novel hybrid tool will perform in augmentation of the post-Soviet military and foreign policy of the Russian state, then the current African deployment represents a “standardization” phase of the model. Third, it seems that the offer of narrow PMC-special forces-local client interaction and deployment undergoes a certain evolution towards an expansionist approach in the sense that Russian interventions come in a wider “package deals” beyond ordinary military diplomacy . These include not only weapons systems and munitions sales but also the provision of security, military and civilian personnel along with political advisors , better known in Russia as “ political technologists ” attached to the clients’ top decision-makers. In this manner, the intervention covers more aspects of the client regime’s needs that go beyond singular security interventions, as the package deals include Russian weapons and munitions, private mercenaries and political advisors that could execute their own version of psychological warfare (so-called information warfare mercenaries) on behalf of the client regime whose interests coincide with those of Kremlin, as well as a platform of commercial interaction between the client regime and the oligarchical interests close to the Kremlin. In other words, it represents a perfect platform for the Russian “hybrid state” to extend its outreach abroad and replicate multiple interactions with illiberal regimes that mimic the internal dynamics of Russian socio-political and economic model under President Vladimir Putin. It is the export of the quintessential core model of the hybrid state and its peculiarities within the scope of the old Soviet sphere of influence and its client states where the boundaries of the powerful post-Soviet private interests, organized crime and the state itself are blurred or non-existent. The export of this peculiar hybrid brand is done under the thin ideological disguise of global support for national sovereignty and upholding of stability, as a total antecedent of the “liberal mess” created by the West and the U.S. in particular. On October 9, 2017, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Sochi with President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera, who went to Russia on a private visit. Image: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs If on the supply side the offer is one of package deals (export of state-sponsored and private enterprise advanced “services” that cover the entire spectrum from mercenary provision and political warfare support for the execution of opaque business deals ), then on the demand side there is a rising interest from multitude of clients that prefer the “no questions asked, no further strings attached” approach. They see it as gaining not only Russian military supplies, mercenaries , instructors and political advisers but rather a purchase of a peculiar form of contemporary Russian “ insurance policy ,” one that provides additional guarantees for the survival of regimes and their leadership in cases of “Western inspired” attempts at regime change. The quest to gain such insurance fits nicely with the overall Russian conspiratorial rhetoric regarding the global role of the West, where the regimes in question are actually victimized by subversive plotting from abroad with local “fifth column” help and any measures deemed “defensive,” whether aimed at the home population or at actors abroad, are permitted. In other words, the gloves are off in the name of sovereignty and stability even if that means the deployment of sharp instruments such as foreign mercenaries operating on home soil. Central African Republic: Part of an emerging “package deal” trend? The details and peculiarities of Russia’s CAR involvement might provide illustrative insights into the dynamics of exporting this specific Russian state sponsored and/or private entity interaction model that aims to project power with limited exposure abroad. It also highlights the classic features of the potential of operational deniability that is used in wider African and Middle Eastern contexts. On the supply side of the deal the intent and interests are quite clear, namely advancing Russian arms exports into new or rediscovered African markets via an initial “free” or loan-based delivery that draws on Russia’s accomplishments in Syria; establishing a strategic outpost that allows Russia to counterbalance China’s growing ambitions on the African continent, thus showing that it should not be treated as a “junior partner” in the Sino-Russian tandem; and last but not least, upsetting France in what it deems to be its own backyard at relatively low cost and minimized risk of exposure. In addition, the window of opportunity that the whole operation provides allows for future financial sustainability, as the deployment of Russian personnel tends to be close to mineral-rich areas of an impoverished and war-torn country. In sum, the initial Russian calculation is to kill a whole flock of birds with one precise stone throw. On the opposite demand side of the deal the intent also seems to be rather clear – maintenance and consolidation of power in an embattled regime via the age-old tactic of inviting a foreign power to back up and boost local hard power resources, but also provision of personal security and advice for the command-and-control center that is to be protected and isolated from evolving domestic threats. If these supply-demand dynamics are viewed in the context of Russia’s involvement in the Central African Republic it becomes obvious that the model follows a familiar pattern, as demonstrated in Syria. Telling signs detected via scrutiny of the scarce open source information reveal the Russian modus operandi in extending its state power projection outside its borders via the described elements of the package deals, including civilian instructors that most likely belong to PMCs and are usually ex-special operators with strong ties to Russian civilian and military intelligence agencies. A closer look at the particular case of CAR yields most of the features necessary for execution of a package deal that combines all of the elements – arms sales, the provision of state military advisors, civilian instructors, and a personal security detail for top political decision-makers, going beyond a simple weapons deal or even one-time mercenary unit deployment. Touadera’s stealth visit to Sochi in October 2017 was followed by the partial lifting of a United Nations embargo that has three times allowed for armaments delivery (December 2017 and February and April 2018), likely in exchange for mining and diamonds concessions granted solely by Touadera without parliament’s approval. This seems to follow the pattern of politically motivated gas and oil deals executed by Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria, where both he and the Russian side had a lot to gain: for Assad it meant acquiring an additional revenue source to support the regime’s stability, and a convenient platform was established for exchanging political favors between oligarchic operators of large economic enterprises and their respective political leaders. Upon the arrival of Russian military and civilian personnel in Bangui, several sources reported that their deployment was far from transparent, and followed another familiar pattern , namely in smaller groups, occasionally with forged papers, reportedly disguised as private security companies registered in countries outside Russia. That would be a logical approach, as on an operational level any traces back to Russia need to be concealed to ensure official deniability, and to obfuscate precise information about the exact number and composition of the group deployed. This follows the best practices of the Soviet maskirovka (i.e. military disguise), given that this year the Russian government with the overwhelming support of the siloviki (members of the security and military forces and the politicians who rose from their ranks) issued yet another negative review of a proposal to legalize PMCs, thus recognizing their existence but rendering them technically illegal.

На фиг нужен Южный, у него и выхода к морю нет. pic.twitter.com/qoSQ9I3ben — Александр Коц (@sashakots) December 12, 2017 The reported mode, scope of engagement and activities also should not be a surprise, as Russian personnel have engaged in discreet efforts to engage opposition forces near the Sudanese border (another country with a Russian presence ), well outside the scope of arming and training designated CAR battalions, as well as swift efforts to secure unlimited access and seal off Touadera from outside threats and influence. Having the president’s ear, coordinating his personal security detail and acting as a liaison between CAR’s top political decision-makers and the economic and defense establishment in Russia puts the advisors in a superb position to collect intelligence and monitor and influence local politics. Based on this package multi-functionality it is possible to decipher the role of advisors in various interventions and activities, such as those observed in the 3rd arrondissement of the capital Bangui, where violence has surged in recent months . A Russian Cessna 182T aircraft is protected by UN police and military personnel at Kaga Bandoro, Central African Republic, April 28, 2018. Personnel aboard the plane reportedly held discussions with militia leaders in the town. Image: @agoufleury/Twitter The presence of Russian personnel and their activities creates a sentiment that aligns well with the current Russian foreign policy worldview that is based on a paranoid fear of plots and subversion created by the West and designed to throw into turmoil and undermine the sovereignty of non-Western states. It certainly echoes in the words of Touadera’s local advisers that voice their fear of a Western-sponsored coup aiming to bring down the president from power. The lack of opportunity to firmly consolidate political power and the fear of outside coup engineering make Touadera a perfect client for Russian “insurance,” one that would provide guarantees for his survival. The insurance package includes weapons, state and non-state personnel, a prime platform for murky business deals and ultimately a form of personal and regime protection from Russia, the resurgent prime backer of illiberal and autocratic regimes. It also guarantees a reserved junior-league spot in the illiberal “ club of multipolarity .” In search of global “package” distribution In conclusion it is important to underline that the deployment of Russian PMCs in multiple countries as a foreign policy tool represents an integral part of a larger emerging trend, one that signifies a policy shift in search of global engagement with regimes that seek stability, cheer for anti-Western “patriotic multiculturalism,” deem themselves embattled, and firmly bet on autocratic methods for power maintenance. This club of countries prefers to deal with modern Russia simply because there are no additional questions asked or any unnecessary strings attached – just good old-fashioned business. In turn, the club membership can expect a wider menu that ranges from weapons to private military and civilian personnel without any higher expectation from the local power stakeholders. For these regimes this particular Russian approach holds not only ideological but opportunistic appeal, as for them it is easier to maintain transactional relationships with the Kremlin, rather than invest efforts to uphold higher standards of accountability in their local mode of governance. Thus, there should be little surprise at the current Russian efforts from Afghanistan and Syria , through Lebanon and Libya all the way to Eastern and Central Africa . Indeed, the Russian offensive stretches much further beyond Africa and can be detected as far as the Philippines . So next time the news breaks out about new Russian arms sales or military and civilian assistance to a country that does not make regularly the global headlines, make sure to watch closely for an unusual presence, as the Kremlin surely has recognized the high utility value in deploying its own private military contractors, as a powerful “grey zone” tool in distant theaters.

PETERSBURG (Sputnik) - A Russian military base may appear in the Central African Republic, the framework agreement envisions such a possibility, but the issue has not been discussed so far, CAR Defense Minister Marie-Noelle Koyara said in an interview with Sputnik. ""We have not yet discussed this. Everything will be done within the framework of the military treaty that we signed. This treaty is the basis of all our initiatives… Much still needs to be done, but there will be discussions between the supreme commander-in-chief (the president of the republic) and his colleagues. And the ministers will enforce it,"" Marie-Noelle Koyara said. She said that when a Berengo training centre had been established for military personnel, people began to talk about turning Berengo into a Russian military base, but this was speculation, as it could not be considered a Russian military base. ""Our population perceives Russia very well. When the talk is about Russia, people understand that this is a full-fledged partner that may change the country's future. And it is this human support, so to speak from the masses, that suggests that the word 'partner' is fully applicable to Russia,"" Koyara added. The authorities and armed groups of the Central African Republic are ready for a meeting on settlement under the auspices of the African Union, they expect to be notified of the date and venue, Marie-Noelle Koyara added. ""Armed groups are ready for a meeting, we are ready for a meeting, all interested parties are ready for a meeting, and now we are waiting for the response from the African Union as a coordinator, when and where it should take place,"" Koyara said. The meeting on settlement of the conflict in the Central African Republic under the auspices of the African Union should result in the development of a road map, Marie-Noelle Koyara said. ""The elected president chose the path of dialogue to return to peace, after which the African Union decided to aggregate all the proposals to develop a road map to implement this path. And now the role of the African Union is to send expert representatives to a joint meeting with representatives of the CAR government,"" Koyara added. After the disarmament of Anti-balaka and Seleka in the Central African Republic, the armed groups may join official security structures, Koyara stressed. ""The main goal of this dialogue is to bring these groups to disarmament. After that, they have, in fact, two paths… Those who want may join security agencies. These are the police, the army, the gendarmerie and those involved in forestry,"" Koyara said. Others, she said, may return to peaceful life as part of public projects and social programs. ""One of the recommendations that we heard at the international forum in Bangui was that due to the fact that there was such a huge number of crimes, we cannot afford a full total amnesty. Those who committed crimes must answer for them. Therefore, our Justice Ministry has much work to divide [people] into those who may be pardoned and those not worthy of it, who may not be pardoned,"" Koyara said. Arms Supplies to CAR The United States and France consider the UN Security Council's embargo on Russian weapons supplies to the Central African Republic to be technical, work is underway to remove the existing issues, Marie-Noelle Koyara said. ""Three weeks ago, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian visited the Central African Republic, and we discussed this situation, among other things. It was said that the embargo problem was more of a technical nature – if the Security Council lifted it, then the issue would be resolved. And he advised how to present our position for the embargo to be lifted,"" Koyara said. She said the US side had also confirmed that the embargo was technical. The Central African Republic has been destabilized by a violent conflict between Christian anti-Balaka militia, Seleka faction and the government since 2012. Since 2014, the country has been divided between the three groups. In late August, Seleka and anti-Balaka militia signed a Declaration of Understanding after a Russia-brokered peace meeting in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. © Sputnik Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address ",2019-01-10 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-24 23:26:48.581083+00:00,EXTM

Central African Republic Defense Minister Marie-Noelle Koyara told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that the establishment of a Russian military base is possible under an agreement signed in August between Moscow and Bangui. ""We have not yet spoken about the concrete development of the base, but such a possibility is not excluded in the framework agreement,"" Koyara said. ""If the presidents, as supreme commanders and leaders of the nation, decide to deploy the base, then our countries will carry it out,"" she added. She further explained that authorities and armed groups of the Central African Republic are ready for a meeting to discuss the move under the auspices of the African Union.

She said an army training center had already been established in the country with Russia, which could not be considered a military base. Russia has already deployed light arms and troops to CAR –a member of the United Nations – after obtaining approval from the UN Security Council. The Central African Republic, a former French colony, has for decades been mired in poverty, hunger and violence due to ethnic and religious conflict between rival militias. The United States, which has a significant military presence in Africa, has recently launched a new strategy to counter what it calls the 'predatory' practices of Russia and China in the continent. US National Security Adviser John Bolton accused Moscow and Beijing of using ""corrupt"" and ""predatory"" practices to gain an economic advantage over Washington in Africa. ""They [China and Russia] are deliberately and aggressively targeting their investments in the region to gain a competitive advantage over the United States,"" he added. China has already provided many countries in Asia and Africa with billions of dollars in aid and loans for roads, railways, ports and other major infrastructure projects. It has also set up its first overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017, where the US also has its main base of operations in Africa. The US, which already runs 34 military bases across Africa, has in recent years used the presence of Takfiri terrorists to build up its presence across the continent, where it has over 6,000 boots on the ground.

Photograph: Alexander Shcherbak/Tass Wed 1 Aug 2018 10.14 EDT Last modified on Wed 1 Aug 2018 12.06 EDT Three Russian journalists killed in the Central African Republic this week were investigating a Russian private military company with links to the Kremlin, their editors said. The Investigations Management Centre (IMC) said on its website on Tuesday that the team of reporters, led by the veteran war correspondent Orkhan Djemal, had been researching the actions of the Russian military firm Wagner, which has also been active in Syria and Ukraine. The three Russian journalists flew into the war-torn country on Friday and had been in contact until Sunday evening, the centre said. Media reports said that the men may have been ambushed and killed Monday evening near the village of Sibut, about 185 miles (300km) north of the CAR’s capital, Bangui. “It’s impossible to believe this, but there is already no hope that this is a mistake,” the statement from the IMC read. Their deaths were also confirmed by the Russian foreign ministry. Earlier the men had been refused entry to a military base they believed run by Wagner because they lacked proper accreditation, Anastasia Gorshkova, deputy editor at the IMC, told the Russian television station TV Rain. Russia was authorised by the UN last December to provide government armed forces with weapons and training. Some Russian media have reported that Wagner, a shadowy private military company tied to a wealthy restaurateur turned government contractor named Yevgeny Prigozhin, was active in the country. The IMC was also concerned that the journalists’ driver or fixer could have been in league with police, seeking bribes from them. The journalists were carrying thousands of dollars in cash and cameras when they were killed, Gorshkova said. Some media reports said the journalists had been ambushed by 10 Arabic-speaking men. Alexander Rastorguev was best know for his documentary Srok, about the anti-Putin opposition in Russia. Photograph: Alexei Maishev/AP The three Russians were accomplished journalists who had worked with independent or opposition media organisations. Djemal was the former political editor of Novaya Gazeta and had covered conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine. He was known by colleagues for his aggressive, often fearless, conduct as a war correspondent. Djemal had been imprisoned in Somalia and wounded in Libya. Alexander Rastorguev was a director best known for his documentary Srok (The Term) about Russia’s anti-Putin opposition. Kirill Radchenko was an accomplished photographer who had also served as an elections monitor in Chechnya during presidential elections, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The IMC is backed by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian oligarch who was imprisoned for a decade under Vladimir Putin for financial crimes seen as having political motivation. Russian state media have largely avoided reporting on what the journalists were researching, since the Kremlin has publicly denied any link to Wagner or even acknowledged the existence of the private military company. Russia’s foreign ministry said the men had entered the country as tourists. Wagner is best known for its work in Syria. Leaked contracts suggest that the company received oil concessions from the Assad regime in return for providing protection for certain strategic facilities. Hundreds of Russian mercenaries , some tied to Wagner, were said to have been killed in a clash with US forces in February. Private military companies are technically illegal in Russia, but Wagner’s commander, Dmitry Utkin, has been seen in close proximity to the Kremlin. He was photographed during a Kremlin reception where he was awarded a medal for bravery. Utkin is also said to have a fraught relationship with the Russian military, which is reported to be backing rival private military companies. Russia is one of the world’s more dangerous countries for journalists. At least 58 journalists have died violent deaths in the country since 1992, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Read more A number of those killed had worked for Novaya Gazeta, which has published investigations critical of the government and the military. One of the paper’s star correspondents, Anna Politkovskaya, the veteran Chechen war reporter, was shot to death in her apartment block in 2006. After a series of threats against their journalists last year, Novaya Gazeta’s editor suggested he might arm his newsroom with defensive weapons. This year a Russian investigative journalist, Maxim Borodin, who was said to be investigating Wagner, died after falling from his fifth-storey balcony . It was unclear what caused the fall, though his editors told the Guardian that after visiting his apartment they did not believe the cause was foul play.

The statement comes after a rebel leader demanded Russia explain the presence of its “mercenaries” in the country. A French colony until 1960 and one of the poorest countries in the world, the CAR has suffered from fighting since 2013, when mostly Muslim rebels overthrew the government but were pushed back by Christian militias. The United Nations Security Council allowed Russia in 2017 to begin delivering arms to the country's new Christian president, and Moscow sent 175 instructors to train CAR troops earlier this year. The president's personal guard is now reportedly made up largely of Russians. Last week Moscow said it would send more arms and instructors in the greatest show of influence in Africa since Soviet times. “Africa belongs to Africans and no one else, no more to the Russians than the French,” French defence minister Florence Parly told the weekly Jeune Afrique. “Russia has asserted its presence in the Central African Republic in recent months, it is true, but I am not sure that this presence and the actions deployed by Moscow, like the agreements negotiated in Khartoum at the end of August, help to stabilise the country.” French defence minister Florence Parly leaves the Elysee Palace after a cabinet meeting last week Credit: Eric Feferberg/AFP Armed groups signed a tentative agreement in August that Russia and Sudan helped to broker. French peacekeepers are in the CAR as part of a UN mission. After a Muslim assembly leader was kicked out by a censure vote on Friday, Abdoulaye Hissene, head of the National Defence and Security Council (CNDS), which includes former rebel groups, demanded all state officials and Russian “mercenaries” leave areas under CNDS control. He accused the Russians of being involved in the “parliamentary coup” against the Muslim leader and said Moscow must explain the “dangerous” role that Kremlin-linked mercenaries were playing in the country. Suspicions have previously been raised that Russians are cutting deals with rebels and deploying mercenaries to guard the extraction of gold, diamonds and uranium. The foreign ministry said earlier this year Russia and the CAR had agreed on joint “exploratory mining concessions”. Three Russian journalists were killed in the CAR this summer while investigating Wagner group mercenaries linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a catering magnate known as “Putin's chef”. The large amount of cash the journalists were carrying was not stolen, nor was their equipment.

Prigozhin has been indicted by the United States for funding a troll factory that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. The Russian trolls have allegedly been targeting the November 6 mid-term elections, and an accountant at the troll factory was charged this month with defrauding the United States.

92,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,http://theconversation.com/how-russia-is-growing-its-strategic-influence-in-africa-110930,"Messenger Much has been made about China’s role and profile in Africa and the factors underlying its activities on the continent. Less debated is the spread and depth of Russia’s contemporary presence and profile in Africa. There was a strong Russian influence in Africa during the heyday of the Soviet Union . The post-independence governments of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Benin at some point all received diplomatic or military support from the Soviet Union. But this began to change after the superpower started to collapse in December 1991 . More than a quarter of a century later Russia’s President Vladimir Putin seems to have new aspirations in Africa. This is in line with his desire to restore Russia to great power status . Putin places a high premium on geopolitical relations and the pursuit of Russian assertiveness in the global arena . This includes reestablishing Russia’s sphere of influence, which extends to the African continent . Like Beijing, Moscow’s method of trade and investment in Africa is without the prescriptions or conditionalities of actors like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Russia is gradually increasing its influence in Africa through strategic investment in energy and minerals. It’s also using military muscle and soft power. Increasingly, the pressing question is: is the relationship between China and Africa as good for Africa as it is for China? The same question applies to Russia-Africa relations . Energy and minerals Interaction between Russia and Africa has grown exponentially this century, with trade and investment growing by 185% between 2005 and 2015 . Economically, much of Russia’s focus in Africa centres on energy . Key Russian investments in Africa are in the oil, gas and nuclear power sectors . The fact that 620 million people in Africa don’t have electricity provides Russia’s nuclear power industry with potential markets. Several Russian companies, such as Gazprom, Lukoil, Rostec and Rosatom are active in Africa. Most activity is in Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Nigeria and Uganda. In Egypt, negotiations have already been finalised with Moscow for the building of the country’s first nuclear plant . These companies are mostly state-run, with investments often linked to military and diplomatic interests. Moscow’s second area of interest is Africa’s mineral riches. This is particularly evident in Zimbabwe, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and the Central African Republic. In Zimbabwe, Russia is developing one of the world’s largest deposits of platinum group metals . Russia has also been reestablishing links with Angola, where Alrosa, the Russian giant, mines diamonds . Discussions between Russia and Angola have also focused on hydrocarbon production. Uranium in Namibia is another example. Russia’s current controversial involvement in the Central African Republic (CAR) began in 2017, when a team of Russian military instructors and 170 “civilian advisers” were sent by Moscow to Bangui to train the country’s army and presidential guard. Shortly after that, nine weapons shipments arrived in the CAR. Interest in the country has focused on exploring its natural resources on a concession basis. The murder of three Russian journalists in a remote area of the country last year focused the world’s attention on what looked like a Kremlin drive for influence and resources. Military influence and diplomacy Russia is the second largest exporter of arms globally, and a major supplier to African states . Over the past two decades it has pursued military ties with various African countries, such as Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. Military ties are linked to bilateral military agreements as well as providing boots on the ground in UN peacekeeping operations . Combined, China and Russia outnumber the other permanent members of the UN Security Council in contributing troop to UN peacekeeping efforts. Russia has also been actively supporting Zimbabwe. Shortly after it was reported in 2018 that China had placed new generation surface-to-air missiles in Zimbabwe , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that his country was pursuing military cooperation . Significantly, Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said that his country may need Russia’s help with the modernisation of its defence force during a recent visit to Moscow . Russia, Africa and the future Both Russia and China are keen to play a future role in Africa. The difference between these two major powers is that China forms part of the Asian regional economy. This will surpass North America and Europe combined, in terms of global power - based on GDP, population size, military spending and technological investment . China and India have sustained impressive economic growth over many years. And, their enormous populations make them two world powers of extraordinary importance. Growth prospects for the Russian economy, on the other hand, remain modest - between 1.5% and 1.8% a year for 2018-2010, against the current global average rate of 3.5% a year. Still, Russia remains a major power in global politics. For African leaders, the key word is agency and the question is how to play the renewed Russian attention to their countries’ advantage, and not to fall victim to the contemporary “geopolitical chess” game played by the major powers on the continent.

Международное сообщество позитивно оценило демократичность выборов, транспарентность избирательного процесса. Новое руководство страны во главе с президентом взяло курс на восстановление внутриполитической стабильности, а также диверсификацию внешних связей», — сообщил Кожин. Он добавил, что важной вехой в развитии двустороннего взаимодействия стала прошедшая 9 октября 2017 года в Сочи встреча министра иностранных дел России Сергея Лаврова с президентом ЦАР, в ходе которой был подтвержден обоюдный настрой на восстановление практического сотрудничества в политической, торгово-экономической и гуманитарной областях. «В рамках достигнутых договоренностей Россией проводятся мероприятия, направленные на изучение возможностей взаимовыгодного освоения запасов природных ресурсов ЦАР. В 2018 году началась реализация поисковых горнорудных концессий. Исходим из того, что развитие данных проектов будет способствовать стабилизации экономической ситуации в ЦАР, развитию инфраструктуры, а также послужит основой для привлечения дополнительных инвестиций в экономику страны», — детализировал дипломат. Он резюмировал, что Москве приветствуют взятый Туадерой курс на налаживание в ЦАР инклюзивного политического процесса, скорейшее прекращение столкновений на межэтнической и межконфессиональной почве, восстановление государственной власти на всей территории страны, реформы сектора безопасности, а также выполнение плана по национальной обороне ЦАР. Новости СМИ2 В конце прошлого года египетские власти заявили, что не возражают против размещения российской военной базы в соседнем с ЦАР Судане. Об этом рассказывал замглавы комитета по обороне и национальной безопасности в парламенте Египта генерал Яхья аль-Кадвани. По его мнению, это дело официального Хартума, несмотря на общую тенденцию неприятия иностранных баз на территории арабских стран, передает НСН . Тогда директор Центра изучения стран Ближнего Востока и Центральной Азии, полковник в запасе Семен Багдасаров пояснил, что у России в регионе есть стратегические интересы, а появление военной базы позволит закрепиться в регионе. «Это важный регион: с одной стороны Синай, с другой стороны Африка. Это важная база, и России пора закрепляться южнее южного. Там мы сможем осуществлять задачи по судоходству, там же Суэцкий канал», — детализировал аналитик.

The mission to increase Russian influence on the continent is being led by Yevgeny Prigozhin , a businessman based in St Petersburg who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. One aim is to “strong-arm” the US and the former colonial powers the UK and France out of the region. Another is to see off “pro-western” uprisings, the documents say. In 2018 the US special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Prigozhin, who is known as “Putin’s chef” because of his Kremlin catering contracts. According to Mueller, his troll factory ran an extensive social media campaign in 2016 to help elect Donald Trump. The Wagner group – a private military contractor linked to Prigozhin – has supplied mercenaries to fight in Ukraine and Syria . The documents show the scale of Prigozhin-linked recent operations in Africa, and Moscow’s ambition to turn the region into a strategic hub. Multiple firms linked to the oligarch, including Wagner, are known by employees as the “Company”. Its activities are coordinated with senior officials inside Russia’s foreign and defence ministries, the documents suggest. Yevgeny Prigozhin in Vladivostok in 2016. Photograph: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images Putin showed little interest in Africa in the 2000s. But western sanctions imposed in 2014 over the annexation of Crimea have driven Moscow to seek new geopolitical friends and business opportunities . Russia has a military presence and peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic. CAR is described as “strategically important” and a “buffer zone between the Muslim north and Christian south”. It allows Moscow to expand “across the continent”, and Russian companies to strike lucrative mineral deals, the documents say. On 24 May the Kremlin announced it was dispatching a team of army specialists to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press spokesman, they will service Russian-made military equipment. So far Moscow has signed military cooperation deals with about 20 African states. Five days later the Kremlin said it would host the first ever Russia-Africa summit in October in the Black Sea resort of Sochi . Putin and Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, will chair the event. About 50 African leaders are due to attend. The aim is to foster political, economic and cultural cooperation. The leaked documents were obtained by the Dossier Center , an investigative unit based in London. The centre is funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the Russian businessman and exiled Kremlin critic. Prigozhin has been approached for comment. He has previously denied any links to the troll factory and has said of Wagner that it does not exist. Putin has previously said that entities linked to Prigozhin do not constitute the Russian state. Congolese soldiers on patrol in Beni, North Kivu province, DRC. Russia says it sent specialists to the country last month. Photograph: Hugh Kinsella Cunningham/EPA A map from December 2018 seen by the Guardian shows the level of cooperation between the “Company” and African governments, country by country. Symbols indicate military, political and economic ties, police training, media and humanitarian projects, and “rivalry with France”. Five is the highest level; one is the lowest. The closest relations are with CAR, Sudan and Madagascar – all put at five. Libya, Zimbabwe and South Africa are listed as four, according to the map, with South Sudan at three, and DRC, Chad and Zambia at two. Other documents cite Uganda, Equatorial Guinea and Mali as “countries where we plan to work”. Libya and Ethiopia are flagged as nations “where cooperation is possible”. The Kremlin has recently stepped up its ground operation in Libya. Last November the Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar travelled to Moscow and met the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Prigozhin was spotted at the talks . Egypt is described as “traditionally supportive”. Russia in Africa graphic The graphic gives an overview of “Company” activities and achievements. It claims credit in CAR for getting of rid of politicians who are “orientated to France”, including national assembly representatives and the foreign minister. This appears to be Charles-Armel Doubane, sacked in December. It has “strengthened” the army and set up newspapers and a radio station. Russia is an “83% friend”, it says. In Madagascar the new president, Andry Rajoelina , won election with “the Company’s support”, the map says. Russia “produced and distributed the island’s biggest newspaper, with 2 million copies a month”, it adds. Rajoelina denies receiving assistance. Another key territory is Sudan. Last year Russian specialists drew up a programme of political and economic reform , designed to keep President Omar al-Bashir in power. It included a plan to smear anti-government protesters, apparently copy-pasted from tactics used at home against the anti-Putin opposition. (One memo mistakenly says “Russia” instead of “Sudan”.) One ploy was to use fake news and videos to portray demonstrators in Khartoum and other Sudanese cities as “anti-Islam”, “pro-Israel” and “pro-LGBT”. The government was told to increase the price of newsprint – to make it harder for critics to get their message out – and to discover “foreigners” at anti-government rallies. In a leaked letter Prigozhin wrote to Bashir complaining that the president had not actually followed through on the advice. Prigozhin mentioned “lack of activity” by the Sudanese government and its “extremely cautious position”. The military deposed Bashir in April in a coup. Last week Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces opened fire on pro-democracy protesters, killing over a hundred . The Russian advisers had urged Sudan’s military council to suppress the activists with “minimal but acceptable loss of life” , one former regime source told CNN. Sudan security forces are deployed around Khartoum’s army headquarters on 3 June. Photograph: Ashraf Shazly/AFP/Getty Images Meanwhile, Moscow is keen to exploit a long-running territorial dispute in Comoros , the documents say. France directly controls one out of four of the Indian Ocean islands, Mayotte. In 2018 Prigozhin employees flew to Comoros via Belarus. Their objective was to test if “political technologies” might be used to inflame the row between Paris and the Comoros government. Other suggestions in the documents include trans-African road and rail-building schemes. A railway could be built linking Dakar in Senegal with Port Sudan in Sudan, along the “old hajj [pilgrimage] route”. A separate 2,300-mile (3,700km) toll road was proposed connecting Port Sudan with Douala in Cameroon. Neither has so far happened. A plan to revive “pan-African consciousness” appears closely modelled on the idea of Russkiy Mir, or Russian world. The concept has become fashionable under Putin and signifies Russian power and culture extended beyond current borders. Read more One working paper is titled “African world”. It calls for a developing “African self-identity”. It recommends collecting a database of Africans living in the US and Europe , which might be used to groom “future leaders” and “agents of influence”. The eventual goal is a “loyal chain of representatives across African territory”, the March 2018 paper says. More immediate practical measures include setting up Russian-controlled non-governmental organisations in African states and organising local meetings. It is unclear how many Prigozhin initiatives have actually gone forward. There is evidence that media projects mentioned in the documents are now up and running – albeit with marginal impact. They include a website, Africa Daily Voice, with its HQ in Morocco, and a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama , based in Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo. Russian operatives also offer thoughts on global politics. One policy paper, titled “Russian influence in Africa”, says Moscow needs to find “reliable partners among African states” and should establish military bases.

96,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.insideover.com/politics/putins-attempts-to-penetrate-africa.html,"Levin Opiyo 31 August 2019 During the cold war, the Soviet Union had great interest in Africa, where it sought to build its own influence against Western countries which had already established their presence through colonization. Its strategy involved penetrating trade union movements, supporting liberation struggles, and providing aid to newly independent African states. Its policy towards African trade organisations, which were still in their early stages, was two fold. The first was to indoctrinate budding Africans by sponsoring their studies in trade union colleges in communist countries with the aim of making them influential trade unionists on their return. Secondly, to win over African leading trade unionists by enticing them with gifts and cash, and also sponsoring their holidays and tours to socialist countries. Most African political parties had been banned while others had restrictions imposed on them by colonial governments. This effectively made trade union organisations the only channels through which Africans could pursue their political goals. So whoever controlled trade union movements controlled the African masses. It was also hoped that the enticement of leading trade unionists would eventually influence the transfer of African trade union organisations from the Western backed International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) to the Soviet backed World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). In Kenya, for instance, the Soviet-sponsored Oginga Odinga to initiate a split in Tom Mboya’s Kenya Federation of Labour which was allied to the ICFTU. The result was the formation of Trade Union Congress of Kenya (TUCK) which immediately allied itself to the communist WFTU. However, because of the strong British influence in Kenya, the TUCK couldn’t survive long enough. A similar strategy was adopted by the Soviet in its support for Africa’s struggle against colonialism. This involved sponsoring leading nationalists and sending upcoming politicians to colleges in socialist countries. Working through the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee (SAASC) which served as its unofficial foreign policy organ, support was mobilised for African and Asian nationalist movements under the cover of defeating racism and colonization. Across the continent nationalists were recruited as agents and groomed as future leaders in the hope that they would protect and cater for Soviet interests in their respective countries after independence. These preferred leaders acted as point men, coordinated Soviet aid in their respective countries, and furthered communism. They selected young Africans who were sent to institutions in the Soviet where they learned many skills including military tactics. It was expected that on their return they would help in furthering Soviet goals. In independent African countries which were perceived as being led by Western backed leaders, the Soviet took steps to sponsor pro-East rivals to take over the government. This included funding their political campaigns and giving them huge sums of money to buy off support in parliament. And in some cases, to start revolutions to depose the existing governments. African countries which had won independence but were still under White minority rule, such as South Africa, were also given military aid. After the cold war, however, Russia just like western countries lost its interest in Africa and limited its aid to the continent. But this changed in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. This followed the deposition of the pro-Moscow Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, who later on sought refuge in Russia. Western countries and the European Union termed Russia’s move illegal and came up with a series of sanctions to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin’s administration and its oligarch. A range of diplomatic measures which included the exclusion of Russia from the G8 which subsequently became the G7, were introduced. The G8 summit which was supposed to be held in the Russian city of Sochi, was cancelled and instead a meeting of G7 was held in Brussels on 4-5 June 2014. The ongoing talks of Russia joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) were suspended. The same applied to all bilateral talks between Russia and EU. Another set of sanctions were called “restrictive measures” targeting individuals and entities who were perceived as having played a great part in the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. These included visa bans and asset freezes. The EU’s third set of sanctions were called, “Restrictions for Crimea and Sevastopol”. Since the Union did not recognise the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, it imposed substantial restrictions on economic exchanges with the territory. The US and Canadian sanctions were more open ended and could be placed in three categories. The first restricted Russia’s access to Western financial markets and services for designated Russian state-owned enterprises in the banking energy and defence sectors. The second placed an embargo on exports to Russia of designated high-technology oil exploration and production equipment. The third was an embargo on exports to Russia of designated military and dual use goods. The effects of these sanctions coupled with the fall of oil prices, rapidly depreciated the value of Russia’s currency, the Rouble. After making numerous efforts the Central Bank of Russia stopped defending the value of the Rouble and instead hiked interest rates . With the sanction putting intense pressure on the economy, Vladimir Putin decided to turn to Africa to find new markets and partners. The efforts to penetrate Africa are currently being led by Yevgeny Progozhin, one of his close allies who has been linked with military contracts in Syria and Ukraine. Just like during the cold war, Russia hopes to increase its influence in Africa by providing military aid, grooming new leaders and signing business deals. Apart from selling arms, it hopes to make economic gain by exploiting Africa’s mineral resources such as gold and diamond. In Central African Republic (CAR), which has been plagued by a serious civil war, Russia runs a peace keeping mission which is being carried out by a small team of its military personnel and mercenaries from Wagner Group, a private military company linked to senior officials in the Kremlin and whose main financer is Yevgeny Proghozin. Although the goal of the peace keeping mission according to Russia is to bring about stability, it is secretly being used to create a conducive environment for the exploitation of the country’s minerals. Central Africa is rich in diamonds, gold, and uranium which are yet to be explored, and Russia, using its new influence, has already secured mining concessions which were initially given to China. It has also established its presence in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, another mineral rich country with huge deposits of gold and diamond. Recently, it sent a team of military specialists to the country to offer maintenance and repair services to military equipment. To ease the shipment of raw materials from Africa to Russia and goods from Russia to Africa, Moscow recently entered an agreement with Eritrea to establish a logistics base in the country. Eritrea is strategically located along the Red Sea and would definitely give Russia good access to the world’s major maritime routes. The Chinese and the Americans already have their bases in the neighbouring Djibouti. The only concern amongst security experts is that Russia’s interest in Africa could lead to gross human rights violations and security challenges, as it sells weapons to despotic governments and deploys mercenaries in regions under conflict.

Tout indique que des experts russes s’y trouveraient effectivement. Pourquoi y ont-ils été invités, qu’y font-ils vraiment, et quelles implications cela a-t-il pour la Centrafrique ainsi que pour la Russie ? Voici le tableau de la situation vu de l’extérieur. En octobre 2017, le président centrafricain Faustin-Archange Touadéra s’est rendu à Sotchi en Russie pour rencontrer le ministre des Affaires étrangères russe, Sergueï Lavrov. De source officielle, la visite avait pour but de demander l’appui de la Russie auprès des Nations unies pour une levée temporaire de l’embargo sur les armes à destination de la Centrafrique. [Malgré la fin de la guerre civile en 2014, plusieurs régions du pays restent en proie à la violence, et l’État ne contrôle qu’une infime partie du territoire national.] Le président Touadéra a également demandé de manière informelle la fourniture d’armements et de véhicules pour trois bataillons des Faca (forces armées centrafricaines), soit 1 500 hommes environ. La réponse fut positive. Un mois plus tard, l’ONU a accepté, pour les besoins de Moscou, de suspendre partiellement l’embargo sur les armes en Centrafrique et, le 26 janvier 2018, un premier avion-cargo militaire Il-76 a atterri dans la capitale, Bangui. Dès le 31 mars, le président Touadéra présentait en grande pompe un premier contingent de 200 hommes vêtus de camouflages russes et portant des armes russes. L’unité était commandée par des hommes étrangement blancs. Mais la principale surprise s’est déroulée la veille, le 30 mars, dans le grand stade de football de Bangui, lors de la célébration du deuxième anniversaire de l’élection de Touadéra. La garde rapprochée du président était composée d’hommes armés de type slave. Jusqu’alors, la sécurité publique lors des grands événements était assurée dans la capitale par les derniers soldats rwandais de la mission de l’ONU en Centrafrique (Minusca). Des “gardes blancs” autour du président centrafricain À l’heure actuelle, les gardes blancs ont pratiquement entièrement pris le contrôle de l’administration présidentielle et bénéficient d’un accès illimité à son agenda de déplacements, aux personnalités clés de l’entourage de Touadéra, à son garage et aux véhicules blindés. L’administration présidentielle centrafricaine reconnaît l’existence d’une “unité russe spéciale pour le renforcement de la sécurité du président”. Une nouvelle fonction de “directeur de la sécurité” a été créée au sein de l’administration, occupée par un officier russe chargé de “l’encadrement des gardes du corps”. La presse française voit en cet officier un “intermédiaire clé pour les contacts tant sécuritaires qu’économiques entre Centrafricains et Russes”. En quelques semaines seulement, des Russes, le plus souvent en civil mais à l’allure toute militaire, se sont imposés dans la vie de la capitale centrafricaine. Ils ont été vus non seulement dans le palais présidentiel et aux alentours, mais aussi dans les ministères, à [...] ",2018-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-24 23:38:18.222890+00:00,EXTM

Cette pâtisserie haut de gamme est l’un des rares endroits de la capitale centrafricaine à servir des cappuccinos et des croissants décents, mais les occupants du véhicule ne se sont pas attardés. Ils ont pris livraison de leur commande – des centaines de baguettes sorties du four – et ont quitté immédiatement la ville. Si peu de gens s’en doutaient à l’époque, ces baguettes étaient peut-être le premier signe tangible des ambitions russes sur le continent africain. Le pain devait nourrir les contractants militaires privés – c’est-à-dire des mercenaires – installés au palais de Berengo, l’ancienne résidence de Jean Bédel Bokassa [à la tête du pays de 1966 à 1979], pour former plus d’un millier de soldats centrafricains. La présence russe en République centrafricaine est passée inaperçue jusqu’à la fin juillet 2018, quand trois journalistes russes ont été tués sur la route de Sibut, à environ 180 kilomètres de la capitale. Ils enquêtaient sur les activités douteuses du groupe Wagner – une société privée de sécurité russe qui serait financée et dirigée par Evgueni Prigojine, proche du président Vladimir Poutine. Le groupe Wagner assurerait la gestion de la base militaire à Berengo. Influencer les élections à Madagascar et en Afrique du Sud Depuis cette date, la Russie et le groupe Wagner ont commencé à apparaître un peu partout sur le continent africain. À Madagascar, des stratèges politiques russes auraient financé plusieurs candidats en vue de la présidentielle de fin 2018.

Crédit photo : CNC Bangui (CNC) – La patrie de Boganda, jadis surnommée « la Suisse de l’Afrique », n’est plus que l’ombre d’elle-même depuis les crises politico-militaires sans fins qui ont ruiné le pays. A quand le temps du renouveau qui verra les fils et filles de Centrafrique goûter enfin les fruits mûrs et savoureux du développement ? En attendant, toutes les aides, toutes les bonnes volontés sont les bienvenues. On apprend ainsi, de sources bien informées, que les Russes se vantent partout d’avoir débuté la construction d’une usine de conditionnement de viande à Gbokolgbo, dans la préfecture de la Ouaka. L’usine devrait créer trente (30) emplois dans la population locale afin de produire une production bouchère de qualité, dans le respect des normes modernes de qualité sanitaire d’emballage sous vide. C’est une bonne chose qui permettra, on l’espère, à de nombreux Centrafricains de jouir d’une alimentation saine et bienfaisante. Mais ce beau projet sera-t-il conduit à bien dans l’intérêt de tous les Centrafricains ? On peut en douter. Et pour cause. La direction de l’usine serait confiée au sinistre mercenaire peulh Ali Darass, le chef de l’UPC. Ce faisant, les Russes ne se sont-ils pas alliés, bien légèrement, à un criminel cynique pour mieux tirer profit de l’argent qui devrait revenir aux paisibles et laborieuses populations ? Quel Centrafricain ignore que le bétail est une des principales richesses du pays ? Moins spectaculaire que l’extraction de l’or ou des diamants, l’élevage représente pourtant près de 13 % du produit intérieur brut (PIB) de la Centrafrique selon les chiffres officiels. En finançant l’usine de boucherie, la Russie ne veut-elle pas bénéficier, elle aussi, de cette vache à lait ? « La caque sent toujours le hareng », dit l’adage populaire et le centrafricain lambda se demande comment des étrangers alliés à un criminel avéré pourraient privilégier l’intérêt général dans leur entreprise. D’autant que, d’après les annonces faites, les Russes ont choisi de placer la sécurité de l’usine sous la protection des miliciens locaux. Diantre ! C’est donc aux groupes armés de protéger les intérêts russes maintenant ! Comment croire que le groupe armé renoncera à ses armes après cela ? Voilà comment les Russes prétendent aider la sécurité en Centrafrique. Pendant ce temps, les représentants russes continuent à avancer leurs pions pour un contrôle accru des institutions de la Centrafrique, pays généreux dont la souveraineté paraît aujourd’hui contrôlée sur les berges de la Volga. Et ils ne cessent d’annoncer la livraison de nouvelles armes comme l’arrivée d’officiers russes dans la MINUSCA, mais ils trouvent toujours une bonne explication pour expliquer leur retard.

Credit photo : Fred Krock, CNC. Centrafrique : Le village EGTB dispose désormais d’un Centre de santé Un centre de santé flambant neuf a été inauguré samedi 29 septembre dernier au profit des habitants du village EGTB – du nom de l’ancienne société forestière ‘’Exploitation générale et transport de bois (EGTB)’’. Il s’agit de l’œuvre patriotique de l’honorable Magloire Joscelin Makango, député de Mbaïki 5. L’assistant du Conseiller russe en matière de sécurité du Président Touadera a remis, à cette occasion, des médicaments et autres kits médicaux audit centre de santé. Une véritable satisfaction pour les habitants venus nombreux en présence de leurs Chefs de Groupements et de villages et biens d’autres autorités locales de la Lobaye invitées à la cérémoni Grand village de plus de 3000 habitants situé à près d’une dizaine de kilomètres de la ville de Mbaïki sur la route de Bagandou, le village Moto-Wakombo devenu depuis 50 ans village EGTB connait, comme beaucoup des villages centrafricains, d’énormes problèmes liés au manque de services sociaux de base. Pour la santé par exemple, des pertes en vies humaines sont enregistrées malheureusement à cause de la distance reliant le village à l’hôpital de Mbaïki, surtout pour les cas d’accouchements comme l’a relevé Kevin Lamine, Président de la jeunesse dudit village. Il y va de même pour l’école où les petits enfants sont condamnés à marcher quotidiennement sur des kilomètres pour atteindre leurs établissements. « A chaque fois que nous posons le problème à nos autorités ou à nos partenaires, ils disent que nous sommes proches de Mbaïki et qu’en cas de maladie, nous devons nous y rendre pour se soigner. Malheureusement, beaucoup de gens ont perdu la vie en cours de cette périlleuse route de Mbaïki. Beaucoup de nos enfants ont déserté à cause de la distance… », a indiqué Kevin Lamine. A en croire le député de Mbaïki 5, promoteur de la création du Centre de santé d’EGTB, les habitants lui en fait parvenir ces besoins en termes de plaidoyers, et il a bien voulu se mettre à l’écoute, mais aussi contribuer à la recherche de solutions aux problèmes énumérés par les habitants. « Les élus de la nation que nous sommes, avons deux attributions principales, à savoir proposer et voter les lois ; puis contrôler l’action gouvernementale. Mais, vu la situation que traversent nos populations aujourd’hui, nous nous sommes vus dans l’obligation de voler à leur secours dans différents domaines. Voilà pourquoi, je suis là pour remettre officiellement ce bâtiment qui abritera les services de santé au profit des populations de ma circonscription. Je ne resterai pas là, d’autres besoins sont exprimés dont celui de la création d’une école. », a déclaré l’honorable Joscelin Makango. Ce centre de santé a été entièrement construit sur fond personnel du député dont les travaux ont débuté il y a un an. A l’inauguration du bâtiment, l’Assistant du Conseiller russe en matière de sécurité du Président de la République, M. Kopot, a procédé à la dotation dudit centre hospitalier en médicaments et autres équipements médicaux. « Le bien-être de la population centrafricaine tient à cœur le Président Faustin Archange Touadera, et nous avons estimé qu’il est important d’être plus proches des populations avec notre appui », a-t-il déclaré à l’issue de la cérémonie. Et, de préciser, en ce qui concerne la dotation du centre de santé d’EGTB que « Nous avons été contactés par le Député Joscelin Makango avec qui nous entretenons de bonnes relations. Il nous a fait part de son projet et nous n’avons pas hésité de venir aider les populations ». Dans les kits médicaux remis au centre de santé d’EGTB, M. Kopot a indiqué sans trop de détail qu’ils sont constitués des tests de malaria, les médicaments de traitement de paludisme… bref, tout ce dont a besoin un Centre de santé. Sur les traces de leur député, M. Alain Bassangagna, Chef de centre sanitaire d’EGTB a adressé ses remerciements, ainsi que ceux des habitants bénéficiaires, à M. Valery Zakharov, le Conseiller russe du Président Touadera pour l’appui qu’il a accordé en dotation de leur centre de santé.

Bangui (CNC) – Arrivés en catastrophe en République centrafricaine début 2018 dans la foulée de la levée partielle de l’embargo sur les armes imposée par le Conseil de sécurité des Nations-Unies,les Russes, à travers leurs instructeurs militaires des FACA, ont installé à la Présidence de la République, avec la bénédiction du chef de l’État Faustin Archange TOUADERA, une cellule de propagande musclée contre les partenaires occidentaux du pays dans le but de les décrédibiliser. Enquêtes. Après l’installation de la cellule de propagande de Boy-Rabe par monsieur Valery Zakharov, le conseiller russe du chef de l’État Faustin Archange TOUADERA, dont les membres sont sélectionnés constamment pour des formations aux techniques de propagande en Chine ou en Russie, les partenaires russes du chef de l’État ont installé début novembre 2018, à seulement quelques mètres de la résidence du Premier ministre Simplice Mathieu Sarandji au quartier PK11, une station de radio dénommée Lengo Songo dans laquelle la ligne éditoriale est strictement contrôlée par les partenaires et les mots « français, américain, France, États-Unis … » ne doivent en aucun cas être prononcés à l’antenne. Comme si cela ne suffisait pas, les partenaires russes du chef de l’État ont installé au cœur de la Présidence de la République à Bangui, sous la supervision de monsieur Harouna Douenba, un autre conseiller ivoirien du chef de l’État, une cellule de propagande restreinte chargée de la rédaction des articles de presse et de la définition de stratégie globale de campagne anti-occidentale et anti-Minusca dans le pays. Cette cellule de la Présidence, qui ravitaille certains médias par des articles préformâtés (à la gloire de Moscou et contre les intérêts occidentaux en RCA), et payés une fois la publication faite, sponsorise et pilote à distance non seulement des manifestations publiques anti-occidentales à Bangui, mais aussi d’autres sites internet et des ONG fictives comme ANA (aimant Notre Afrique) , dirigé par un Directeur de rédaction d’un journal centrafricain en ligne, l’association APPAP –(Alliance des partis et personnalités politiques) coordonné par le Centrafricain Cyriaque Azouassa, l’activiste de campagne anti-Minusca et occidentale sur les réseaux sociaux. Outre les médias et les ONG sponsorisés par les Russes avec des fonds publics centrafricains, la cellule de la Présidence de la République, qui définit la stratégie globale de la propagande anti-Minusca et occidentale, met l’accent particulier sur la création des faux comptes sur des réseaux sociaux afin de tenter de décrédibiliser certains médias en ligne par des commentaires du genre « Intox,, fackNews, fausse information, sans pour autant la vérifier, encore moins lire l’article en question…. ». Des commentaires parfois proches de l’idiotie sont très facilement reconnaissables sur les réseaux sociaux par les lecteurs. Finalement, les Centrafricains se demandent à quoi servent toutes ses propagandes médiatiques contre les partenaires de longue date de la République centrafricaine. Le pays pourrait-il s’en sortir avec un seul partenariat avec la Russie qui est elle aussi un pays moins développé comme la RCA ? Et les Centrafricains, quel bénéfice qu’ils tirent de toutes ses campagnes ? Affaire à suivre. ",2019-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-24 23:41:09.360634+00:00,EXTM

Photograph: Kirill Kukhmar/Tass Faustin-Archange Touadéra and Vladimir Putin at the Russia-Africa summit. Photograph: Kirill Kukhmar/Tass Fri 25 Oct 2019 07.20 EDT Last modified on Fri 25 Oct 2019 07.46 EDT The president of Central African Republic has said his country would consider hosting a Russian military base, as Vladimir Putin woos dozens of African leaders in an effort to spread Moscow’s influence at an investment summit in southern Russia. In an interview with Russian state media, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra said he had also asked Russia for new weapons shipments for CAR’s soldiers, who have fought a civil war against rebel forces in the country since 2012. Asked about a potential military base, Russia’s first in Africa , he said that his government was “considering the possibilities”. The Kremlin later denied that Putin had discussed the establishment of a Russian military base in CAR. Touadéra said the question was being reviewed by the two countries’ defence ministries. The remarks came as Russia holds its first Russia-Africa summit, an estimated £55m effort to charm African leaders with the prospect of arms deals, and investments in mining, nuclear energy and other spheres, while promising no political strings attached. Read more Russia believes it can extend its influence to become a geopolitical powerbroker in Africa and begin to make up ground against China’s massive investment in the region, while edging out other powers like the US and France. The timing for the summit has also been fortuitous, with Putin recently brokering a deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey to take joint control over previously Kurdish-held territory in north-eastern Syria. The deal highlighted Russia’s role as a dealmaker in the conflict and ability to withstand western pressure, as well as the abrupt US pullout from its alliance with the Kurds under Donald Trump. Leaked documents revealed by the Guardian in June showed that Russia has sought to bolster its presence in at least 13 countries in Africa through military deals, private business contracts, and by grooming a new generation of leaders. That mission to spread Russian influence was led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman close to Putin whose interests include a private military group that has deployed to Ukraine, Syria and CAR. But while Prigozhin’s efforts to spread influence have largely remained in the shadows , Russia this week has sought to shine a spotlight on its growing relationship with Africa. On Wednesday, Putin rolled out the red carpet in Sochi, holding marathon bilateral sessions with African leaders to say Russia was open for business. “We currently export to Africa $25bn [£19.5bn] worth of food – which is more than we export in arms, at $15bn,” he said. “In the next four to five years, I think we should be able to double this trade, at least.” As the conference began, Russia flew two Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear bombers to South Africa, the first time the planes have landed on the continent. Russian trade with Africa is about 10% of China’s, which exceeded $200bn last year, but Moscow has traditionally dominated certain sectors like weapons exports. Agriculture, mining and civilian nuclear power were also a focus during the summit. Overall, Russia said $12bn in deals had been struck at the conference, although many were in memorandums of understanding that may not be fulfilled.

Past the rival billboards, Russian-sponsored radio stations, school classes, cartoons, film screenings and beauty contests are all jostling for locals' attention. French and Russian propaganda posters jostle for attention in downtown Bangui Credit: Jack Losh Indeed, Russia's growing reach has prompted calls on the Kremlin to be lawful and transparent in a region earmarked for Russia’s push into Africa. “Our message to the Russians is obviously any deals have to be done with the government and have to be legal,” the UN's deputy chief peacekeeper in CAR, Kenneth Gluck, told The Telegraph. Russia launched its surprise intervention in CAR five years after civil war erupted in 2013 between a Muslim rebel coalition and Christian “Anti-Balaka” militias. Moscow’s opening gambit involved flying in weapons shipments and military contractors in early 2018 to shore up CAR’s national army, targeting a volatile region that France regards as its equatorial backyard and winning mining rights in return. A recent UN report revealed the capabilities of Russian military instructors who have deployed nationwide in CAR, training all levels of the country’s security forces—including hundreds of police officers and over 2,200 soldiers. Their numbers are intensifying to outdo EU military officers who run a concurrent mission to train CAR’s army. In response to questions from The Telegraph, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman described CAR as “a promising partner for Russia”, adding: “Russia is prepared for constructive cooperation with French partners…Unfortunately, false information is sometimes disseminated in the press, including France’s, that discredits the Russian presence in CAR. [This] risks destabilising the already-fragile situation in the country.” The French foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

In the capital’s sprawling shantytowns, locals can tune into “Lengo Songo” on 98.9FM which, funded by Russian money, broadcasts African music alongside Russian language lessons. Its news reports trumpet fresh caches of Russian weaponry as well as prospective agrobusiness ventures backed by Russian investment, including new meat-processing plants and canning factories to supply CAR's army. The station's EU-backed rival is “Radio Ndeke Luka”, a popular outlet that describes itself as “the radio of all Central Africans”, with reports covering anything from government corruption to women's rights and negotiations with rebels. Beyond broadcasting, Russia puts on “Friendship Lessons” in CAR’s schools, involving specially curated history courses and boxes of free “WE LOVE RUSSIA” t-shirts. Moscow’s money has paid for a new youth football tournament launched on Saturday as well as gym equipment draped in Russian flags. Pro-Russian banners at these events are written not in French—an official language from the colonial era—but in the vernacular, Sango. Meanwhile Moscow has resuscitated its Soviet-era student exchange program with CAR, sending a growing number of Central Africans to Russian universities. And last year its Bangui embassy hosted a drawing and poetry contest for local teenagers. Winners were offered a trip to Russian-annexed Crimea to stay at a Soviet-era holiday camp originally built for the Young Pioneers, the USSR’s version of the Scouts.

Bangui’s “Lycée Charles-de-Gaulle”, founded in 1992, is one school in a network of nearly 500 accredited, overseas institutions that the foreign ministry in Paris describes as a “lever for French influence”. Other French initiatives in CAR include sponsoring budding welders on vocational courses and training bureaucrats and firefighters. A cultural centre called the ‘French Alliance of Bangui’ is on a self-proclaimed mission “to promote and disseminate La Francophonie”, bringing thousands of locals each year into its classrooms and libraries stocked with French magazines, literary classics and comics. China has its own “Ecole d’Excellence Chine-Centrafrique” on Bangui’s potholed Avenue du President Mobutu. And Moscow is reportedly following suit with upcoming plans to build a Russian cultural institute. Moscow’s propaganda playbook contains odd elements. Russian officials have shown pupils in CAR a pro-Russian animated knock-off of The Lion King, which charts the friendship between the bear of Russia and the lion of CAR. Besieged by a pack of rebellious hyenas, this cartoon lion roars out for help, prompting the bear to journey from Siberia’s snowy wastes to save him. The animation's credits show it was produced by Lobaye Invest, a Bangui-based company that has won mining concessions in CAR and is linked to the Russian oligarch, Yevgeny Prigozhin—a close ally of the Vladimir Putin. Bankrolling much of Russia’s push into the country, Prigozhin is widely thought to be behind the shadowy Wagner Group, which investigators say has deployed mercenaries to Libya, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine —and now CAR, where estimated numbers of Russians range from 250 to 1,000. Lobaye Invest funds an array of projects in the country, from the “Lengo Songo” radio station to the training of army recruits. It even sponsored last year’s “Miss Central African Republic” beauty contest—another one of Moscow's soft-power initiatives—during which a dozen young women paraded in front of government VIPs and Russian officials to win the crown. The media war is taking place online too. Anonymous Facebook accounts have popped up to hail Russian activities and smear rivals, sowing cynical half-truths and rabble-rousing falsehoods. One page called ‘Support to Russia in CAR’ celebrates Moscow’s military aid but recently denigrated a CNN investigation into Russian mercenaries, accusing the journalists of “spreading false information” and bribing interviewees, which the US outlet strongly denies. Suleiman Abossa, right, a rebel soldier with the FPRC armed group, stands at a checkpoint on the main road in northern rebel-held territory Credit: Jack Losh Its other posts accuse “neo-colonial” France of committing “serious violations of human rights” and links through to Sputnik—an inflammatory, Russian state-run news agency. Elsewhere the account falsely describes two accredited French journalists, who have both investigated Russian activities for leading outlets, as “secret agents”. One local journalist in CAR told The Telegraph how Russian officials pay reporters in Bangui to pen anti-French articles and cover Russian embassy events. In response, according to the Africa Intelligence newsletter, France's embassy has bolstered its communications unit “to wage this media battle with Moscow more effectively”, launching a series of campaigns in the press and on local radio. As part of their humanitarian outreach, the EU is generally more discrete, channelling its support through established funds to local organisations. The Russians, meanwhile, have distributed aid in PK5—Bangui’s volatile Muslim enclave—and set up field hospitals offering free care to civilians in north-eastern, rebel-held towns, which they say treat hundreds of patients a month. It is this remote, restive region bordering Chad and Sudan that Russia will struggle most to tame. The area is controlled by AK47-wielding militants who are clad in a motley array of camouflage and accused of committing war crimes. Early in September, in violation of a new peace deal brokered partly by Russia, violent clashes erupted between two rebel groups in the town of Birao, displacing thousands. Wildlife rangers take a rest while on patrol in a national park in rebel-held territory Credit: Jack Losh Recent revelations from this vast, lawless area could put Russia in a bind. UN investigators say that, despite new accords, rebel groups in CAR have continued to acquire arms in the neighbouring Sudanese region of Darfur from the ‘Rapid Support Forces’. This tribal militia, formerly known as the ‘Janjaweed’, is led by the deputy head of Sudan's ruling junta and the country’s most powerful general, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as Hemeti. This means that Moscow is, on the one hand, backing the government in CAR against rebel groups being armed, on the other, by the de facto leader of Sudan—also a Moscow ally. “From Russia's point of view, there is room for building mutual benefits among the opposed parties,” says Hans De Marie Heungoup, a senior analyst for International Crisis Group. “Another view is that you cannot bargain with the angel and the demon at the same time.” Regardless, the Kremlin’s envoys in CAR are undeterred. “In a few months, Russia has managed to achieve peace, even if it’s not a lasting peace but a truce” Moscow’s ambassador, Vladimir Titorenko, said. “Former French colonies are moving away from the metropolis.” The EU’s ambassador in CAR called on international players to cooperate more closely in war-ravaged CAR. With rival powers crowding CAR, European nations risk losing to upstarts like Moscow and Beijing. “We would like to sit around the table with everybody…and work together in a transparent way,” Samuela Isopi told The Telegraph. “Coordination is not easy.” Related Topics ",2019-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-24 23:46:04.890203+00:00,EXTM

ПРЕМИУМ 23 october 2015 | 21:00 Russia has the ability to help Democratic Republic of Congo reach its potential The Democratic Republic of Congo is believed to be the most resource-rich country in the world, yet it has struggled to develop because of two decades of war. Russia, which recently began renewing its ties with Africa, is ready to help Congo achieve political stability and economic prosperity. Congo is taking a step this summer that may help — increasing the number of its provinces from 11 to 26. That decentralization is designed to give more political and economic clout to regions that feel underrepresented, particularly the eastern part of the country, where a civil war is raging. Russia can help Congo achieve stability and prosperity. It has a history of engaging with the country during its early days of independence in the 1960s. It also has expertise in extracting the minerals that could make Congo prosperous. And it has a willingness to help Africa’s second-largest country end its civil war. “We wish to develop relations (with Congo) in every direction,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has asserted. The Democratic Republic of Congo’s resources are worth $24 trillion, experts estimate. The biggest minerals trove on earth includes 70 percent of the world’s coltan, more than 30 percent of its cobalt and diamonds, and 10 percent of its copper. Coltan is a mineral containing the elements niobium and tantalum, which are widely used in electronics. A lot of Congo’s mineral resources have yet to be tapped, however. A key reason is the civil war, which has scared off would-be investors not just in the east but the entire country. The conflict that has devastated the country has a complicated history. The fighting that occurred during the 1990s was actually a combination of regional and civil war, pitting Congo’s armed forces against neighboring countries’ armies and guerrillas. Today’s conflict is purely a civil war. The guerrillas are fighting because they believe that Congo’s population, particularly those living in the east, have failed to benefit from the country’s natural-resources wealth. Their argument is hard to refute. International surveys of gross domestic product per capita always list Congo as among the poorest nations on earth. As Russia gears up its investment in Africa, it would like to help Congo change that. Russia’s stature as a global leader in oil, gas and mineral extraction could be a major help to the country of 75 million. In addition to petroleum- and mining-development help, the Democratic Republic of Congo needs transportation and energy assistance. The country has only 2,250 kilometers of paved roads, half of which are in bad shape. It also has a shortage of rail lines. Russia’s experience building roads, rail lines, ports and other transportation links would make it a natural partner in Congo’s quest to create goods- and people-moving infrastructure. Russia could also help Congo build the facilities it needs to become energy-independent. The country is crisscrossed with rivers that could be used for hydroelectricity. In fact, experts say Congo has so much hydro potential that with enough dams it could be a major exporter of electricity to neighboring countries. Russia is also one of the world’s leading nuclear-plant builders and operators. That expertise would come in handy if Congo wanted to broaden its energy mix. A sweetener is that Russian companies’ terms for building and running nuclear facilities are among the most generous in the industry. Congo was a colonial territory known as the Belgian Congo until becoming independent in 1960. The Soviet Union reached out to the new country right away, establishing business, educational and cultural ties with it. In fact, in 1960 the U.S.S.R. established the Peoples’ Freedom University of Russia in Moscow specifically to educate young people from Congo and other developing nations in Africa, Asia and South America. The fast-developing relations between the Soviet Union and Congo were cut short when Congo’s first president, Patrice Lumumba, was assassinated in 1961. Cold War politics stalled relations between the countries until after the break-up of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Russian leaders believe they can work with the current president, Joseph Kabila, a pragmatist whose priorities include getting the country on a faster development track. Kabila has signaled he’s open to working with any country of goodwill that’s ready to help. But peace is crucial to Congo achieving its development potential. Lavrov has declared that Moscow is willing to do whatever it can to help bring peace to the country and the rest of Africa. He hasn’t discussed the specifics of a Congo peace strategy, but Russia’s commitment is clear. The end of the civil war would put Congo on a development path that would transform it from one of the world’s poorest countries to a prosperous one. Russia would benefit from the broader economic ties it forged with Congo as the country accelerated its development. It would truly be a win-win partnership.

China’s Ambassador to Dominica, Li Jiangning told the ground breaking ceremony on Monday evening that the new facility “will bring higher quality medical services to the community in the years to come. “I am confident that this new facility once it is completed…would enhance the capacity of Dominica to deal with new emerging health issues and challenges as well as current ones. It will contribute to long term social and economic development of this beautiful country.” The Chinese diplomat said the new hospital will be “one of the most complicated and challenging project to construct for both sides…thanks to the tremendous efforts put in by both sides”. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said that the new facility should serve as an impetus for Dominicans to put aside their political differences and unite for the socio-economic development of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country. “I need more ambassadors for Dominica from Dominica. It is amazing ladies and gentlemen that we travel and hear the most delightful things foreigners say about this country and then you read what is advanced by persons whose navel strings are buried right here on this island. “It is absolutely amazing some of the things they say. That is why I am saying…that I want this hospital project to be apolitical. This is not Labour or UWP starting construction for a new hospital. This is Dominica getting a new modern well equipped hospital to benefit every single citizen in our beautiful country.” Skerrit said he was urging all Dominicans “to proclaim to the region and the world that Dominica has just started construction of a modern state of the art hospital and soon will boast some of the finest healthcare service in the region”. He said the new facility could also spawn a new tourism product, “health and convalescent tourism which would be a wonderful adjunct to our famous nature island experience”. The construction of the hospital by a Chinese firm, forms part of the four-pillar projects agreed to in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two governments when they re-established diplomatic relations in 2004. The new hospital is being built on the same site at the present Princess Margaret Hospital, at goodwill, on the outskirts of the capital. Negotiations for the hospital started in 2010. Talks of constructing a new hospital in Dominica goes back to 2010 with Skerrit announcing three years later that the facility was among projects to be undertaken that year through gratuitous aid and concessionary financing from Beijing.

The housing development is scheduled to be completed within 54 months and will be developed in six phases, with 14 clusters. Each cluster will be served by essential community amenities such as sidewalks, grocery stores, recreational spaces, and have easy access to public transportation. Lands will be reserved for the building of a primary school, secondary school, church, police station, health centre, and commercial facilities.

This will represent approximately eight per cent of the total cost of the two developments which have been on Jamaica's wish list for years. Last September the Government announced that both projects would be fast-tracked after the Cabinet approved joint-venture agreements between CHEC and the Factories Corporation of Jamaica (FCJ). Details of both agreements were presented by Prime Minister Andrew Holness in Parliament on Tuesday in response to questions posed by Peter Bunting, the Opposition spokesman on industry, investment and competitiveness. According to Holness, the Naggo Head project will have rentable building space of 810,000 square feet with the full development cost being approximately US$75 million. The Morant Bay project will have rentable building space of 365,000 square feet and is projected to cost approximately US$49.8 million. The FCJ, which will be leading both developments, will contribute $1.78 billion in equity for the Naggo Head Technology Park and $800 million for the Morant Bay Urban Centre. Holness, in his response to the questions from Bunting, said the decision to partner with CHEC on the two projects came after the Chinese firm made an unsolicited offer to the FCJ. “On receipt of the unsolicited investment proposal, FCJ assessed the merits of the proposal and identified that the proposal was of a unique nature,” said Holness. He argued that the proposal was unique because CHEC, as a private investor, would arrange 100 per cent financing to facilitate the development of both projects without any Government or FCJ guarantee and without any cash contribution from the State. “It allows the FCJ, as an investor, to capitalise on the bilateral agreement between the Jamaican and Chinese governments whereby funding, if available, may be secured at a concessionary interest rate to be provided by a Chinese financial institution. “It [also] allows FCJ, without any cash injection, to maximise its return on investment of up to 70 per cent, without which [it] may not have been available to the GOJ,” added Holness. The prime minister further argued that without going the route of a joint-venture it would be challenging to find an investor to put up the large amount of money that would be required to package the project to present to a financial institution for consideration of funding. Holness added that under the joint venture agreement each development will be done by a project company, with CHEC holding a 30 per cent stake in each, the FCJ 29 per cent, and 41 per cent available to other investors. He said both projects will be financed by a combination of debt and equity with the money to be sourced before the work begins. “If the loan is not secured before start-up, then CHEC is obligated to use its own resources to provide bridge financing to initiate the project and this will be in the form of a loan to the project company, which interest rate will not exceed the interest rate that would ordinarily be paid had the financing been secured with China Development Bank,” said Holness. While not giving a start date for the two projects, Holness said they are scheduled to start at the same time and be completed together. When done, the Morant Bay Urban Centre is slated to house the St Thomas Municipal Council, St Thomas Parish Court, Tax Administration (Revenue Centre), an office of the Passport Immigration and Citizenship Agency and a branch of the National Insurance Fund. These State agencies will account for approximately 40 per cent of the available rental commercial with the other 60 per cent being made available to other Government agencies and private sector investors for rental. The Naggo Head Technology Park is not planned to house any Government agency as it is being targeted to offer world-class information and communications technology/business process outsourcing facilities. It will also facilitate an appropriate mix of industry and services for optimum functionality. Now you can read the Jamaica Observer ePaper anytime, anywhere.

The challenges to the construction of the airport have been narrowed down to a suitable acreage of flat land and construction financing. In his Independence Day address on the weekend, he announced that the long-awaited facility will be delivered next year. “We have been working on this project and have hired a reputable American firm to advise on the best way and best place for sitting an international airport,” he explained, “They have advised us on an area between Woodfordhill and Wesley.” Hon Skerrit revealed, “We have been discussing and negotiating the funding of the airport with a number of interested parties., Today, in the year of our Lord 2019, I can announce to you that the Government of the People’s Republic of China sent a special envoy to me last week to confirm that China will provide the financing to build the international airport for Dominica.” The announcement was met with cheers and applause. Hon Prime Minister Skerrit quoted from the Bible that one must seek and knock and he will find. He said that the doors have been opened for Dominica to have its international airport. “This week, we visited the site and on November 8th, they will send a team to review what we have done so far and to look at the next steps. So, my dear friends, with the solid support if the People’s Republic of China, Dominica will have its international airport and work will begin in earnest in 2020, the year of our Lord.” In the meantime, he says, discussion is in advanced stages with several airlines to make Dominica more accessible to visitors. Hon Skerrit reported that by February, JET Blue will help bring passengers directly from New York to Dominica. Seaborne from November 12th will help connect international air carriers to Dominica with daily flights from Puerto Rico. He says Seaborne will also overnight in Dominica to allow for early departures and easier connections. Air Antilles has increased flights from four to seven days a week from Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint Maarten into Canefield Airport and Douglas Charles Airport, Hon Skerrit revealed.

The certificate and key were presented to the Minister for Education and Human Resource Development, Petter Saint Jean by Chinese Ambassador to Dominica, Li Jiangning on Wednesday 20 January 2016 at the Ministry of Education. The Dominica and Chinese Governments signed a six million dollars contract for the new school in October 2013 as the thirty-year old existing building was in a state of deterioration, coupled with persistent threat of slope failure posing danger to students. The school, which is a grant from the Chinese Government, was expected to be completed within fourteen months of the contract signing but suffered a few set-backs. “I’m happy to inform today that the Newtown Primary School, funded by the People’s Republic of China is now complete and as of the second week of January, the students of Newtown and surrounding areas actually moved to the new school, marking the commencement of the new school term,” Minister Saint Jean said. Chinese Ambassador to Dominica, Li Jiangning presenting the certificate of completion to Minister for Education and Human Resource Development, Petter Saint Jean He added that the school, which comprises of fourteen (14) classrooms and can accommodate three hundred (300) students, was not significantly affected during the passage of Tropical Storm Erika and the contractors were able to put the finishing touches in the last couple of months of 2015. “Two weeks ago, officials of the Ministry of Education, along with the Project Supervisor visited the site of the new school to assess its readiness for opening. I was advised that all is in place, including the procurement of all furniture for the effective functioning of the school. The new school is truly a state of the art facility, a modern structure that caters for the needs of students,” Minister Saint Jean informed. “The school boosts large student friendly classroom, rooms for art and craft, information technology, a library, a kitchen to facilitate the school feeding program, and comfortable office space and staff quarters for school administration and teachers. Other amenities include a sick bay and a new feature to our schools in Dominica, an elevator that caters for the needs of the physically challenged students,” he continued. The Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development is planning an official commissioning ceremony for later this year as “work is ongoing on the school grounds”. “While significant progress has been made to level and prepare the yard for sporting activities and to clear the grounds of all debris associated with building, the construction of the perimeter fence will continue well into the month of February,” Mr Saint Jean said. The Ministry of Education, he added, “is extremely pleased with the new school” and thanked the People’s Republic of China for this gift of “a long overdue educational institution to the people of Newtown” for which the government and people “are profoundly grateful”. Meanwhile, to the Chinese Ambassador and government, the completion of the new Newtown Primary School is “another example of our strong friendship and cooperation between our two countries” Ambassador Li added that the eleven-year diplomatic relations between China and Dominica, “has come a long way and many achievements have been made”.

The bridge was severely damaged following the collapse of the Matthieu Dam in July 2011 and the government of the People’s Republic of China funded its reconstruction. The bridge project commenced in 2016 headed by China Railway 14th Bureau Group Corporation Limited and was scheduled to be completed in September 2017, but was delayed due to Hurricane Maria. Project Manager for the China Railway 14th Bureau Group Corporation Ltd, Xiangping Fan said while the passage of Hurricane Maria, hindered their progress, it did not affect the quality of their work. “The newly constructed bridge stood. This is a true testimony of the quality of work that the China Railway 14 is known for,” he said adding that it is ready to withstand the elements. He said the Company is pleased to hand over the bridge which will serve the people of Layou and by extension the entire country. “May it not only serve as a passage to the other side of the river but may it serve as a connection to each and every Dominican… the Yorke Valley project is a wonderful beginning.” This bridge he said symbolizes the deep friendship between the two countries in the face of difficulties and disasters.

Bangui, République centrafricaine, mardi, 23 mars 2021, 07:49:30 ( Corbeaunews-Centrafrique ). Arrivée de Wagner en RCA en 2018… En 2018, lorsque la société Wagner arrive discrètement en Centrafrique, de nombreux habitants expriment leur étonnement et leur inquiétude vis à vis de ces étrangers ne parlant pas leur langue. Il était encore plus étonnant de constater l’insistance de ces mercenaires pour installer leurs bases en province, dans des zones riches en ressources naturelles… Malheureusement pour eux, en 2018, la grande majorité de ces zones sont aux mains de groupes armés locaux, notamment dans la région de Bria, riche en diamants. Pas de chance pour Wagner ! Surtout que le Front Populaire pour la Renaissance de la Centrafrique (FPRC), qui contrôlait cette zone, est connu pour sa violence. Wagner choisit la corruption et la collaboration avec tous les acteurs Pour s’assurer de pouvoir accéder aux ressources sans être dérangé, Wagner choisit alors de collaborer avec les seigneurs de guerre locaux. En 2019, à Khartoum, au Soudan, un accord de paix est négocié entre le gouvernement centrafricain et plus d’une dizaine de groupes armés. Parmi eux, nous retrouvons le groupe du Général Nourreddine Adam… le FPRC, très actif dans la région de Bria. Comme par hasard, voilà une affaire qui arrange bien les intérêts de Wagner. L’accord de Khartoum, destiné à œuvrer en faveur de la paix en Centrafrique, a malheureusement été perverti par des intérêts privés obscurs. Il a en effet été révélé par la suite que plusieurs groupes armés signataires de l’accord avaient reçu de fortes sommes d’argent en échange de leur signature. Ainsi, cet accord, qui est pourtant une initiative nécessaire pour le bien du pays, est entaché de manœuvres de corruption pour faciliter l’accès aux ressources naturelles du pays à des individus peu scrupuleux. Mais la stratégie de Wagner s’est retournée contre eux En échange de leurs signatures, les groupes armés ont pu bénéficier discrètement de financement, et d’autres avantages. Mais une fois l’argent livré, il n’y a plus d’accord qui tienne. Pire, en achetant cette fausse paix, Wagner a contribué au financement des groupes armés qu’ils disent combattre aujourd’hui ! Ces derniers se sont alors empressés d’acheter armes et matériels pour poursuivre les combats et organiser le coup d’État de la Coalition pour le changement (CPC), lancé en décembre dernier. Finalement, cette société privée russe a donc joué un double jeu en collaborant avec les groupes armés comme avec le camp présidentiel. En fournissant armes et financements aux rebelles, en échange d’un pillage sans scrupule des ressources des Centrafricains, cette collaboration a aggravé dangereusement la situation sécuritaire du pays de Boganda. Et que dire du refus russe à l’ONU de voter pour le renforcement des effectifs de la MINUSCA ? Pourquoi refuser l’aide de la communauté internationale ? A l’heure actuelle, toutes les aides sont bonnes à prendre quand il s’agit de la sécurité des Centrafricains. Ne serait-ce pas une manœuvre pour que personne ne vienne mettre son nez dans les lucratives affaires et la course aux richesses naturelles de M. Evgueni Prigojine, le sulfureux patron de Wagner ? A l’origine de la situation actuelle, c’est Wagner le pompier pyromane. Par Adama Bria ",2021-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-31 21:51:17.453885+00:00,EXTM

Décidément, rien ne va plus avec ces mercenaires de la société Wagner. Ils chassent les rebelles, ils deviennent encore des rebelles à la place des rebelles. Les populations ne savent plus à quel saint se vouer. Après la reprise d’une ville, ils s’organisent pour rançonner, racketter et voler les pauvres centrafricains et quelque peu des sociétés paraétatiques qui s’y trouvent. Ainsi, à Bossangoa, on assiste depuis quelques semaines à un véritable pillage de la ville par les mercenaires de la société russe Wagner. Les populations les dénoncent, et appellent à la communauté internationale ainsi qu’à la Cour pénale internationale . Dans le but de reconquérir les villes occupées par les rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC), le gouvernement centrafricain faisait appel au gouvernement rwandais qui a dépêché en République centrafricaine ses ex-rebelles devenus des soldats de l’armée nationale rwandaise, mais aussi des mercenaires de la société russe Wagner après un accord de partenariat. Ainsi, à la mi-janvier, ces forces bilatérales, appuyées par les soldats de l’armée centrafricaine, ont lancé une offensive musclée contre les positions des rebelles qui ont tour à tour quitté leur position dans des villes qu’ils avaient occupée. Ainsi, le mercredi 24 février, la ville de Bossangoa, fief historique de l’ancien Président François Bozizé tenue depuis quelques mois par les rebelles, a été reprise par les forces gouvernementales. Cependant, après la reprise de ces villes, les habitants de ces localités, qui venaient tout juste de subir les caprices des rebelles, se confondent désormais aux comportements crapuleux des mercenaires de la société Wagner qui n’hésitent plus à piller, rançonner, racketter et voler les pauvres citoyens, mais aussi les agresser. Ainsi, les populations dénoncent entre autres la confiscation de certaines de leur maison ainsi que la destruction de leur élevage par les mercenaires. Chose étonnante, la société cotonnière de la ville a aussi été pillée par ces mercenaires alors que les rebelles ne la touchent pas. Pour les cas de viol et de pillage des boutiques, n’en parle pas. Tout se passe comme si les Centrafricains font face désormais aux rebelles de Jean-Pierre Bemba. Mais à quand la communauté internationale va-t-elle ouvrir ses yeux sur ces crimes ? Il y’a lieu de rappeler aussi que l’hélicoptère russe utiliser par les mercenaires dans leur opération de reconquête des villes à l’intérieur du pays est aussi tombé en panne ce jeudi à Bossangoa. Il est mis sous la bâche par ses pilotes. Par Anselme Mbata ",2021-03-19 00:00:00+00:00,2021-03-31 22:07:08.662365+00:00,EXTM

Photo de courtoisie. Bangui, République centrafricaine, samedi, 27 mars 2021 ( Corbeaunews-Centrafrique). Depuis sa réélection contestée et controversée aux élections groupées du 27 décembre 2021, le président de la république s’abreuve et excelle dans des discours ambigus, avec des contours flous dont la capacité de pénétrer la quintessence du message n’est réservée qu’aux initiés. Contre vents et marrés, le virus de l’erreur a conduit le pouvoir de Bangui à signer un accord infructueux et exclusif avec les groupes armés. Cet accord dit de Khartoum alors signé à coût de billets de banque à Bangui le 6 février 2019 a légitimé ou institutionnalisé de façon insipide les bourreaux du peuple faisant de ces derniers les partenaires privilégiés du pouvoir. Les conséquences juridiques et politiques de cet fameux accord de Khartoum ont offert des postes juteux et sensibles dans la haute administration de l’état en violation des prévisions constitutionnelles. A ce stade, il apparaît important de rappeler qu’en dépit des engagements scellés dans l’accord de Khartoum par les groupes armés, le peuple sans défense subissait des violences, des sévices, des tortures, des pillages, des spoliations, des enlèvements et des innombrables tueries aux vus et aux sus des autorités sans la moindre réaction si ce n’est que des condamnations de principe. Ainsi, il a fallu les évènements militaires du mois de décembre 2020 visant à empêcher la tenue des élections et qualifié par le pouvoir de tentative de coups d’état pour que le pouvoir se réveille de son long sommeil pour se rendre à l’évidence que les groupes armés étaient véritablement des fossoyeurs de la république… la peur a ainsi changé de camp car le pouvoir était menacé. Désormais le pouvoir utilise le langage de fermeté qui se matérialise par les différentes offensives des forces armées centrafricaines appuyées par les alliés russes et rwandais qui ont abouti à la reconquête d’une bonne partie du territoire national. Parallèlement à cette opération militaire qui n’annihile pas véritablement les capacités de nuisance des ténors de la rébellion et pour éviter d’ouvrir un autre front suite à l’hostilité caractérisée de l’opposition démocratique, le président de la république a esquissé un dialogue dit républicain avec un format sectaire, peu audible qui nous ramène à la frontière du malheureux accord de Khartoum. Submergé par la cacophonie politique et l’ambiguïté des contours du dialogue républicain proposé par le président de la république, le citoyen lambda s’interroge : Au regard de l’architecture juridique du pays, qui est républicain et qui ne l’est pas ? Qui est dans la république et qui est en dehors ? Les observateurs de la vie politique centrafricaine étaient unanimes qu’on ne négocie pas avec les terroristes…puisqu’ils ont commencé, pourquoi ne pas continuer ? Pourquoi le pouvoir avait refusé la main tendue de la sous région plus précisément de la CEEAC ? Doit-on comprendre en filigrane que le dialogue républicain proposé sera sans médiateur ? Pourquoi le pouvoir ne communique pas assez pour expliquer au peuple la substance de ce dialogue républicain ? A quand la fin de cette naïveté politique pour enfin définir le format de ce dialogue ? C’est quoi un dialogue républicain en lieu et place d’un dialogue largement inclusif ? Ce dialogue conduira t-il à la rupture en vue de redistribuer les cartes politiques aux forces vives de la nation ? Pensez-vous que le seul usage de la force saura réconcilier durablement les centrafricains ? Au delà du dictat de l’ambassadeur russe teinté d’une hégémonie bolchevique, la crise socio-politique centrafricaine impose sans détours une large concertation à la base de tous ceux qui se réclament centrafricains sans oublier les différents acteurs c’est à dire un dialogue politique inclusif y compris les groupes armés. Au regard des péripéties, on remarque que le pouvoir n’a pas la bonne définition de la notion de la « paix ». Hier en signant un accord politique exclusif avec les groupes terroristes, on nous opposait la maxime qui énonce que « la paix n’a pas de prix ». Aujourd’hui sans pour autant définir le prix, la valeur marchande de la paix, on envisage d’imposer au peuple un dialogue encore exclusif…c’est paradoxal et contrasté. De tout ce cirque digne d’un carnaval brésilien, nous pointons un doigt accusateur sur le peuple à cause de docilité, sa versatilité et qui se laisse souvent orienté par le sens du vent. Pour finir, nous estimons que ce sont les différentes offensives militaires des groupes armés qui ont mis la pression sur le pouvoir de dialoguer car depuis toujours les actes posés par la COD 2020 précédés de ceux de son ancêtre « E zingo biani » étaient systématiquement considérés comme anti-républicain…maintenant qu’on y est, on ne peut dialoguer sans les groupes armés.

Le 15 mars 2021, sur les réseaux sociaux, plus particulièrement sur Facebook, le ministre conseiller spécial du chef de l’État, Monsieur Fidèle Gouandjika, dans un Live, avait indiqué que les centrafricains pourraient offrir leur femme en guise de cadeau sexuel aux mercenaires de la société russe Wagner pour leur intervention au côté des soldats FACA dans leur lutte contre les rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC). Lors d’un point de presse tenu à Bangui, dans la capitale, les femmes leaders, qui ont déposé plainte contre le ministre conseiller Gouandjika, ont demandé que la justice soit faite, et que l’intéressé soit aussi relevé de ses fonctions. « On m’a dit que pour arriver au bureau de monsieur Fidèle Gouandjika, il faut passer par le Président de la République parce qu’il doit connaître ce monsieur plus que nous. Et si ce monsieur se permet de parler ainsi, ça fait mal au cœur. Aujourd’hui ce sont les femmes de Centrafrique, mais demain ça va être qui ? Alors je lui demande tout simplement le pouvoir que le peuple lui a donné pour qu’il soit reconduit à la tête de ce pays, dont il nous relève Fidèle Gouandjika de ses fonctions du ministre conseiller à la Présidence. Nous, les femmes de Centrafrique, qui subissons de tous les jours des travers par rapport à tous ces étrangers qu’ils amènent. Aujourd’hui ce sont les Russes, demain ça va être quoi ? Ce sont les femmes qui souffrent encore de ça. Aujourd’hui, ce monsieur, qui avait servi tous ces gens-là, se permet de traiter les femmes de Centrafrique de ce genre… Ça, il faut que je lui dise pour que le Président écoute parce qu’on est salie dans notre propre chair. On veut le respect pour les femmes centrafricaines. Moi je veux tout simplement que la jeunesse ne voie pas ce monsieur comme un modèle, parce qu’un homme qui parle comme ça d’une femme, il est maudit ! », a déclaré madame Lucie AGBO, responsable de l’association des femmes pour le développement et le progrès en Centrafrique. Rappelons que le ministre conseiller du président de la République va plus loin pour offenser les femmes. C’est un véritable outrage public fait aux femmes, c’est-à-dire les considérer comme des objets. « …Les Russes là ; ils ne cesseront de venir. Ils vont venir. Même s’ils demandent nos diamants, on va leur donner. Ils demandent de l’uranium, on va leur donner. Du bois, on va leur donner. Même s’ils demandent nos femmes pour qu’ils les violent, on va leur C pour qu’ils les violent. Écouter ceux que je vous dis », a déclaré Fidèle Gouandjika dans son live sur Facebook. Pour un enseignant-chercheur camerounais ayant contacté CNC, les propos outrageants du ministre conseiller du président de la République Fidèle Gouandjika sont intolérables, inadmissibles et méritent une sanction tant politique que judiciaire.

Le prix des transports en commun entre Bangui, la capitale, et Bouar, chef-lieu de la préfecture de la Nana-Mambéré, située à 450 kilomètres au nord-ouest de la capitale, a presque doubler depuis quelques semaines. Passant de 10 000 francs CFA à 20 000 francs CFA en raison des multiples tracasserie sur la route. « Tout va bien après l’opération de libération.

Nous réfléchissons aussi sur cette situation de transport car les choses ont changé, mais les voyageurs se plaignent des nombreuses tracasseries sur la route », a déclaré Madame Natalie, déléguée des transporteurs de Bouar. L’armée centrafricaine et ses alliés russes et rwandais ont lancé une vaste opération contre les rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC). Cette opération a permis la libération de l’axe Bangui – Bouar, puis Bouar – Béloko.

Après quelques jours de panique due aux rumeurs de l’avancée des forces gouvernementales, les rebelles de l’unité pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC), membres de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement exigeaient des commerçants de Mobaye, chef-lieu de la préfecture de Basse-Kotto de leur payer une prime de départ avant qu’ils ne quittent la ville. Attention ! Ceci n’est pas une blague. Les rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC) exigent des commerçants de Mobaye de l’argent avant de se retirer de la ville. Selon des sources locales, ils auraient demandé jusqu’à 1,5 million de francs CFA. Après la reprise de la sous-préfecture d’Alindao aux mains des rebelles la semaine dernière par les mercenaires de la société russe Wagner, les rebelles du CPC qui sont à Mobaye commençaient à quitter la ville par peur, laissant derrière eux quelques-uns de leur officier. Ce dernier, qui souhaite désormais quitter la ville à leur tour, exige des commerçants une prime de départ qui s’élevait à 1,5 million de francs CFA. Un véritable revirement dans cette histoire. Les pourparlers seraient en cours, mais les rebelles campent sur leur position. Ce qui fait peur à la population locale d’une possible conséquence. Rappelons que les mercenaires russes, quand ils reprennent une ville, ils attendent les soldats FACA venir occuper la ville avec quelques-uns de leur avant de progresser à une autre.

La ville de Bouar, capitale provinciale de la Nana-Mambéré, située à environ 450 kilomètres au nord-ouest de la capitale Bangui est secouée depuis cette nuit par la reprise des affrontements dans les villages périphériques de la ville. Les populations sont en débandade, et les combats se poursuivent. Après le retrait des rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement de la ville de Bouar à la mi-février, ces derniers se sont repliés, pour une bonne partie, dans les villages longeant l’axe Bouar – Niem. Ces rebelles, selon des sources locales, multiplient des exactions : racket et pillage sur les populations locales, poussant même les responsables de l’hôpital de Beninga à fermer leur portent. Cette nuit, les soldats FACA et leurs alliés russes et rwandais ont décidé d’attaquer les positions des rebelles dans le village Bessan , situé sur l’axe Niem-Yelewa. Selon des sources militaires, des combats se poursuivent à l’heure actuelle entre les FACA et les rebelles. Pour l’heure, aucun bilan n’est disponible, mais des sources indépendantes parlent de plusieurs blessés, et les populations sont dans la brousse pour échapper aux violences en cours.

Pendant le mois de février 2021, M. TOUADERA a tout orchestré pour empêcher cette initiative salvatrice, portée par la CEEAC (Communauté Économique des États de l’Afrique Centrale) et la CIRGL, en vue de mettre fin à la violence et de ramener la paix en Centrafrique. Ce sera tout d’abord, le 12 février 2021, la sortie dans les rues des jeunes du Mouvement Cœurs Unis (MCU), entourés des associations de femmes et de quelques entités de la galaxie présidentielle, et le 13 février 2021, l’instru- mentalisation et la corruption de directeurs d’écoles et de proviseurs de lycées pour mettre dans la rue les élèves, lycéens et étudiants. Par le même procédé, les militants de son parti le MCU (Mouvement cœurs Unis), quelques associations de jeunes et de femmes, ainsi que des partis politiques de la mouvance présidentielle ont manifesté devant le siège de la CEEAC, les 22 et 25 février 2021, afin de refuser la tenue dudit dialogue. Pour couronner le tout, certains conseillers à la Présidence de M. TOUADERA ont clairement exprimé la volonté de ce dernier de ne pas vouloir Dialoguer avec les rebelles qualifiés de « terroristes ». Enfin, la Ministre centrafricaine des Affaires Étrangères portera le 24 février 2021 cette fin de non-recevoir de la part de M. TOUADERA au Président angolais, Son Excellence Monsieur Joäo Manuel Gonçalves LOURENÇO. Bien qu’il ait dans un premier temps annoncé sa disponibilité à organiser sans délai la Concertation avec les Forces vives, le Président Faustin Archange TOUADERA semble avoir plié sous les menaces à peine voilées des faucons de son régime, ainsi que face au refus aussi catégorique que surprenant de son Conseiller russe pour la sécurité et de l’Ambassadeur de Russie, ce dernier sortant largement de son devoir de réserve diplomatique. Cette volte-face de Bangui met à mal la démarche des Chefs d’Etats de la CEEAC. Toutefois une forte délégation venue de l’Angola, conduite par le Ministre des Relations Extérieures, a été reçue à Bangui il y a quelques jours. Nous attendons de voir ce qui en sortira. TOUADERA a ainsi fermé la porte de l’initiative diplomatique de ses pairs de la sous-région en vue du dialogue inter-centrafricain. La Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement (CPC) tient tout d’abord à remercier les Chefs d’Etats de la ClRGL, les Hauts représentants de la CEEAC et de l’Union Africaine pour leur initiative en faveur d’un dialogue inclusif centrafricain et pour leur détermination à mettre fin å la violence en cours en République Centrafricaine. La Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement (CPC) a été réceptive et sensible aux recommandations faites par les Chefs d’Etats à l’issue du mini-som- met du 29 janvier 2021. Ainsi la CPC avait-elle tour à tour accepté le cessez- le-feu immédiat et unilatéral, desserré l’étau autour de la ville de Bangui, rouvert le corridor Bangui/Garoua-Boulai et repris ses positions initiales. Dans la perspective du dialogue du 02 Mars, une équipe restreinte de la CPC avait été reçue par les émissaires de la CEEAC et elle a participé aux travaux préparatoires dudit sommet. Pendant ce temps, les mercenaires du Groupe WAGNER et le conglomérat russo-rwandais ont continué d’occuper les positions et les villes volontaire- ment laissées par la CPC, perpétuant des violences sur la population et pratiquant des exécutions extra-judiciaires multiples à divers endroits du pays, comme récemment dans la ville de Bambari où la découverte de charniers, les enlèvements et les exécutions sommaires sont quotidiens. La Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement (CPC) prend donc acte du refus catégorique de M. TOUADERA de résoudre par le dialogue et la concertation la crise politico-militaire. Cette posture gouvernementale irresponsable entraînera inéluctablement, pour la CPC, un durcissement militaro-sécuritaire. La Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement tiendra pour seuls responsables M. TOUADERA et son gouvernement. Les capacités de la CPC sont restées quasi-intactes. La posture conciliante et constructive qu’elle a observée jusqu’ici ne vise qu’à donner une chance au dialogue national inclusif véritable et à la paix, dans la dynamique engagée par la CEEAC depuis les sommets des Chefs d’Etats d’octobre 2020 et de janvier 2021. Tous les autres mécanismes discutés ou projetés restent par ailleurs assujettis à la tenue effective d’un véritable dialogue national, demandé et attendu de- puis de nombreux mois par l’écrasante majorité de la communauté nationale.

Les résultats seront connus d’ici le 22 mars. Si l’issue du scrutin n’a pas encore été dévoilée, une chose est sûre : le taux de participation ne sera pas très élevé. « Il n’y a pas une grande affluence », observait à la fermeture des bureaux de vote Ali Ousman, responsable du réseau Arc-en-ciel, qui regroupe les observateurs du scrutin de 15 organisations de la société civile. « Chez nous, les législatives ne suscitent pas un grand enthousiasme, c’est la présidentielle qui compte », ajoutait-il./////////////. Après avoir glissé son bulletin dans l’urne au lycée Barthélemy Boganda de Bangui, Godefroy Mokoamanede, directeur d’un bureau d’études, s’était désolé de la faible affluence : « quand les gens votent une première fois, ils ne voient plus l’utilité de voter une seconde fois ». « Je dois faire mon travail de citoyen, malgré l’insécurité. Il ne faut pas que le pays recule », avait embrayé Michel, un cultivateur./////////////. Faible enjeu politique/////////////. La peur de violences a-t-elle tenu les électeurs éloignés des urnes ? Le 27 décembre, les scrutins avaient été considérablement perturbés par l’offensive annoncée sur Bangui de la CPC, coalition des plus importants groupes armés qui occupaient depuis plusieurs années plus des deux tiers du territoire. Réunis au sein de la Coalition des patriotes pour la Centrafrique, ils avaient juré d’empêcher la réélection du président Faustin-Archange Touadéra. Ce dernier a toutefois été réélu, mais avec 53,1% des voix de moins d’un tiers des 1,2 millions d’inscrits. La légalité de la présidentielle comme la légitimité de la réélection du chef de l’État sont depuis fortement contestées par l’opposition./////////////. Globalement ça s’est bien passé, il n’y a pas eu d’incident majeur »/////////////. L’enjeu de ces législatives est faible, tant il fait peu de doute que le parti au pouvoir conservera sa majorité à l’Assemblée nationale. Mais dimanche, le pays tout entier avait les yeux rivés sur d’éventuelles violences dans les campagnes, où les rebelles se sont repliés et menacent toujours, jurant de renverser Faustin-Archange Touadéra./////////////. 140 sièges à pourvoir/////////////. « Globalement ça s’est bien passé, il n’y a pas eu d’incident majeur », a assuré à l’AFP dimanche soir le lieutenant-colonel Abdoul Aziz Fall, porte-parole des Casques bleus de l’ONU déployés depuis 2014 en Centrafrique. « Tous les centres où il n’y avait pas pu avoir de premier tour ont pu voter aujourd’hui », a-t-il ajouté./////////////. Le scrutin perturbé fin décembre a paradoxalement permis au pouvoir de se renforcer, en reprenant militairement du terrain depuis. Mais les rebelles ont été repoussés uniquement grâce à l’engagement dans les combats de centaines de paramilitaires russes et de soldats rwandais, envoyés par Moscou et Kigali à la rescousse de Faustin-Archange Touadéra et d’une armée centrafricaine peu formée et mal équipée. On ignore combien de temps ils resteront dans le pays./////////////. Cent-quarante sièges sont à pourvoir mais, au premier tour, 22 députés ont été élus et seulement 49 circonscriptions sont en ballottage pour le second tour.

L’affaire faisait grand bruit sur les réseaux sociaux dans tout le pays, mais également à Bambari depuis la semaine dernière. Ce jour, le 5 mars 2021, les quatre jeunes ont été arrêtés par les mercenaires russes, à leur domicile, et depuis lors, ils ne sont jamais revenus à la maison. Leurs parents ont mené des investigations auprès de la gendarmerie et de la police locale en vain. Finalement, ils viennent d’apprendre 48 heures plus tard qu’ils avaient été froidement abattus le même jour de leur arrestation par les mercenaires russes, et l’émotion est grande au sein de leur famille. Les victimes s’appellent Mahamat, AndiAllah, Oumarou Balki, et Jean de Dieu Mbrepou. Ils avaient été interpellés chez eux à la maison le vendredi 5 mars 2021, puis exécutés froidement le même jour de leur arrestation par les mercenaires russes. Selon des sources proches de la famille, ils auraient été accusés par les Russes d’avoir collaboré avec les rebelles de l’unité pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC), membre de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC). Ce qui soulève beaucoup d’interrogation sur les manœuvres et pratique des mercenaires russes dans le pays. « Il faut leur expliquer que nous sommes dans un pays ou la justice fait encore son travail. Même s’ils ont accusé de collaborer avec les mercenaires rebelles, ils n’ont qu’à les déférés devant le parquet qui a le droit de les juger. Mais aller les exécuter sommairement, je crois que c’est une exécution extrajudiciaire. On doit interpeller la justice de notre pays, et si ça ne va pas, la justice internationale a le dernier mot », a déclaré monsieur Philip Andipako, cousin de monsieur Jean de Dieu Mbrepou. Quant à trois autres victimes, leur famille ne souhaite pas commenter l’affaire, mais elle se réserve le droit de saisir la justice sur l’affaire. Pour le ministre de la Communication, Monsieur Maxime Ange Kazagui, porte-parole du gouvernement, il n’y a aucune preuve de ces allégations. C’est une manière de freiner l’élan des forces de l’ordre et leurs alliés qui continuent de libérer tout le territoire occupé par les rebelles. Notons que les mercenaires russes sont régulièrement accusés de viol, agression, vol et pillage par les habitants des villes reprises par les forces loyalistes.

136,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://corbeaunews-centrafrique.com/la-centrafrique-au-coeur-dune-guerre-dinformation/,"Publié le 10 mars 2021 , 11:09 Mis à jour le: 10 mars 2021 11:09 Bangui, République centrafricaine, jeudi, 11 mars 2021, 05:33:14 ( Corbeaunews-Centrafrique ). La Centrafrique, l’ex Oubangui-Chari, immensément riche en minerais et pierres précieuses, aussi vaste que la France et vingt fois plus grande que la Belgique, Jadis considéré comme un bastion du « pré-carré » français en Afrique centrale est devenue au cours des trois dernières années l’arrière-cour des ambitions russes sur le continent africain au grand dam de l’hexagone. Comment la France a-t-elle pu perdre pied dans « son porte-avion au cœur du continent », pour emprunter à Jean Pierre Tuquoi, auteur de Oubangui-Chari, le pays qui n’existait pas, au profit de la Russie de Vladimir Poutine ? Comment Paris a « perdu » Bangui Paul-Simon Handy, de l’institut d’études de sécurité de Dakar est formel : « La France a été prise de court par l’implication russe qui ne découlait pas d’une stratégie mûrement réfléchie. Moscou a agi par opportunité » en profitant du vide abyssal occasionné par la fin précipitée en octobre 2016 de l’opération militaire française Sangaris lancée en 2013 au plus fort des massacres intercommunautaires dans le pays et du désenchantement des nouvelles autorités Centrafricaines. « Nous avions souhaité que la Force Sangaris poursuive sa mission et avons regretté son retrait » reconnait sans détour, dans une interview au quotidien Le Monde , le Président Centrafricain, Faustin Touadéra, élu tout juste à peine, huit mois, avant l’acte de requiem de Sangaris. Lâché par la France, le nouveau locataire du Palais de la Renaissance de Bangui, Faustin Touadéra, mathématicien formé à Lille, se tourne vers la Russie. En octobre 2017, il se rend dans la célèbre station balnéaire de Sotchi, au bord de la Mer Noire pour y rencontrer le ministre Russe des Affaires étrangères Sergueï Lavrov. Cette visite signe le début d’un nouvel aggiornamento politico-militaire en Centrafrique marqué par la signature, un an plus tard, d’un accord de défense entre la Russie et l’ancienne colonie française à l’issue du tête-à-tête, à St Pétersbourg, entre le Président Touadéra et son homologue Russe Vladimir Poutine. Moscou s’engage à défendre l’intégrité territoriale de la Centrafrique, envoie des centaines d’instructeurs dans le pays et livre du matériel militaire russe tel que prévu dans l’accord de coopération. Mais pas seulement ! Car ainsi que le souligne Thierry Vircoulon de l’institut français des relations internationales (Ifri) : « Les Russes ont ouvert deux bases dans le Nord-Est du pays, dans la zone diamantaire : à Bria et à Ouata. » et la compagnie minière russe Lobaye Invest Sarlu, dirigée par Evgenil Khodotov, réputé proche du Kremlin, se voit délivrer une demi-douzaine de permis d’exploration et d’exploitation. Les médias au cœur de la lutte d’influence Personne, ou presque, à Paris ne prend conscience de l’ampleur du déploiement russe en Centrafrique. « Mon premier courrier sur la présence russe datait du 8 novembre 2017, mais le message n’est pas passé. Des gens pensaient que ça n’avait aucune espèce d’importance » regrette l’ancien ambassadeur français à Bangui Christian Bader qui alerte aussi le Quai d’Orsay sur la campagne massive de dénigrement dirigée contre la France et financée par les Russes. De fait, selon Julien Nocetti, spécialiste de la Russie, « la véritable motivation des Russes en Centrafrique est de nourrir et renforcer le sentiment anti-français en RCA, et affaiblir son influence en Afrique ». Ce qui expliquerait cette vaste campagne anti-française dans de nombreux médias centrafricains ainsi que l’observe Reporters Sans Frontières, qui affirme avoir recueilli des témoignages de centrafricains ayant été rémunérés par les russes pour mener ces campagnes qui trouvent écho dans les médias internationaux liés à Moscou : Sputnik et RT. Dans les médias centrafricains, la Russie met en avant son absence de passé colonial et vante, par des campagnes d’influence les vertus de la coopération entre Bangui et Moscou. Le dessin animé produit par la compagnie minière russe Lobaye Invest met cela en scène, comme le raconte Poline Tchobar de la Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, l’histoire de ce « lion attaqué par une multitude d’hyènes qui fait appel à son ami l’ours, qui accourt depuis le Grand Nord pour l’aider à se défendre et à faire régner l’ordre en Afrique. » La Chaine de Radio Lengo Songö « Nouons la solidarité », divers médias centrafricains (Centrafric matin, le Potentiel Centrafricain, Djoni sango, Radio Révolution Panafricaine, la feuille volante du Président), ainsi que des ONG comme Urgences Panafricanistes, Aimons Notre Afrique auraient par ailleurs reçu des subsides russes pour alimenter le french bashing et chanter les louanges de Moscou. Sans compter la création de sites pro-russes tel que Bangui24News sur Facebook en outil de propagande hostile à la France. Des tracts inspirés par Moscou vont même jusqu’à être distribués dans la capitale centrafricaine. Ainsi l’un d’eux affirme sans ambages que « la Fédération de Russie est aux origines de la paix en République centrafricaine. » Sur son compte Twitter, Valery Zakharov, qui se présente comme le conseiller spécial du Président de la RCA pour la Sécurité Nationale met en musique la propagande russe : « les Centrafricains sont sortis dans les rues de Bangui pour manifester leurs remerciements aux alliés de la RCA pour la lutte contre les rebelles. C’est la Russie qui a été la première à venir à l’aide et a beaucoup contribué au succès des FACA dans le maintien de la paix ». C’est également sur son compte Twitter que le monde entier découvrira la livraison à Bangui de dizaines de véhicules blindés, des chars et du matériel russe. Riposte française La presse française n’est pas en reste, elle dénonce à longueurs d’articles et sur les plateaux de télévision la présence de mercenaires russes dans l’ancienne colonie. Le quotidien La Croix peste ainsi contre la présence de plus en plus visible des russes « À Bangui, ils sont partout. Les voici assurant la formation de l’armée centrafricaine, encadrant la garde présidentielle (…) Ils accueillent même le Président centrafricain à sa descente d’avion » Pour contrer la campagne de dénigrement anti-française à Bangui, des officines proches de l’armée lancent une contre-offensive sur les réseaux sociaux en créant de faux profils et de faux comptes, qui pointent du doigt la Russie, l’accusant d’ingérence dans les élections centrafricaines. « Bien que les personnes derrière cela aient tenté de cacher leur identité et leur caractère coordonné, notre enquête a trouvé des liens avec des individus associés à l’armée française » indique Facebook qui fait le ménage et supprime 84 comptes et 16 profils Instagram liés à ces officines. Cette opération de contre-propagande « conçue sans une logistique très élaborée, voire de façon amateur » comme l’indique au média russe Sputnik, Fabrice Epelboin, enseignant à Science Po Paris, ne fera donc pas long feu. Facebook suspend aussi de nombreux faux comptes téléguidés par les services de renseignement russe pour influencer la présidentielle centrafricaine . Dans le même temps, de manière plus visible, Paris s’active à contrer l’influence russe dans l’espace médiatique centrafricain. C’est ainsi qu’en novembre 2020, la France par le biais de son nouvel ambassadeur Jean-Marc Grosgurin alloue un financement en soutien au Haut Conseil de la Communication pour l’organisation d’un atelier de formation destiné aux journalistes de médias publics et privés. Présent à l’ouverture de ce séminaire de formation qui vise officiellement à lutter contre la désinformation pendant la campagne électorale et au-delà, le Président Faustin Touadera fustigera les campagnes de désinformation « contre les partenaires de la Centrafrique » La tentative de conciliation Dans ce rapport de force, le conseiller russe Valery Zakharov tente de minimiser la rivalité entre les deux pays. « Nous sommes dans le même bateau ici et notre tâche commune est d’aider la République Centrafricaine » déclare-t-il à Sputnik. La Russie a cependant renforcé sa présence militaire en Centrafrique et pourvu le pays en équipements militaires à grand renfort de publicité. De son côté la France semble avoir entamé un changement de cap en se réengageant après l’épisode déconcertant de la fin de l’opération Sangaris : 280 soldats ont été déployés au sein de la mission militaire de l’Union Européenne en République Centrafrique (EUTM-RCA) dirigée par un officier de haut rang français, le General de Brigade Éric Peltier. Sans compter, les allocations en forte hausse de l’Agence Française de Développement à Bangui, pour appuyer les projets de développement soumis par les autorités centrafricaines ; Si les Forces armées centrafricaines ont pu reprendre le contrôle du corridor stratégique entre Bangui et le Cameroun, qui sert de mamelle nourricière au pays, plusieurs pans entiers du territoire centrafricain restent occupés par des groupes rebelles puissamment armés dont l’offensive récente n’a pas pu se faire, selon Paul-Simon Handy « sans soutien extérieur » , la stabilité de ce pays pourvu en ressources minières inestimables passe désormais par une pax franco-russe couplée à l’initiative africaine conduite par le Président Angolais João Lourenço.

Le mercredi 10 février, vers 10 heures du matin, les soldats des forces armées centrafricaines (FACA), appuyées par les mercenaires russes de la société Wagner, ont mené une opération de démantèlement d’une barrière illégale érigée par les rebelles de l’unité pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC) au village Kombélé, situé à 10 kilomètres de Bambari centre sur l’axe Ippy. Au cours de cette opération des forces loyalistes, deux rebelles auraient été capturés, ce qui n’aurait pas plu à ses camarades rebelles qui ont contre-attaqué les positions des forces gouvernementales qui ont réussi à repoussé l’attaque, mais aussi mettre en déroute les assaillants qui ont du fuir leur principale base logistique et opérationnelle au profit des forces loyalistes qui renforcent désormais leur position dans le secteur. Pendant ce temps, à Bambari centre, la ville est calme, mais l’inquiétude domine au sein de la population qui redoute une nouvelle flambée des violences qui pourrait perturber leur tranquillité.

Après la reconquête de certaines villes de l’intérieur du pays par les militaires de l’armée nationale appuyés par les mercenaires russes de la société Wagner, ces derniers se livrent littéralement au racket et au pillage de la population, mais également au vol et à la détention arbitraire des habitants de villes conquises. Mais ces derniers, dépassés, appellent à l’aide et dénonce le comportement des paramilitaires Russes. Face aux attaques des rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement, qui réunit sept groupes armés du pays, et qui cherchent à asphyxier depuis près d’un mois la capitale en coupant les trois principales routes qui y mènent, le gouvernement centrafricain, à travers des accords de coopération militaire signés avec le gouvernement rwandais et la société de mercenariat Wagner, déploie plus d’un millier des mercenaires russes, mais également des troupes rwandaises à l’appui des militaires de l’armée nationale en vue de reconquérir « toutes les villes de l’intérieur du pays occupées par les rebelles ». Ainsi, le dimanche 24 janvier, les Russes, les Rwandais et les soldats FACA ont repris la ville de Boda aux mains des rebelles, suivi de Boali, Bossembélé, Yaloké, Bouar, Béloko, et tout récemment la ville de Bambari au début de la semaine. Cependant, après la reprise de ces villes, les habitants de ces localités, qui venaient tout juste de subir les caprices des rebelles, se confondent désormais aux comportements crapuleux des mercenaires russes qui n’hésitent plus à racketter les pauvres citoyens, piller les boutiques aux abords de la route, mais aussi agresser toutes personnes, surtout les jeunes, qui portent sur leur corps des cicatrices du vaccin traditionnel. « Après m’avoir déshabillé, les soldats russes ont vu sur mon corps des cicatrices de vaccins traditionnels qui avait été fait par ma mère quand j’étais enfant. Par la suite, ils m’ont accusé d’être un milicien Anti-Balaka. Malgré mes explications, ils m’ont agressé durant des heures jusqu’à l’intervention d’un gendarme centrafricain », a déclaré un habitant de Yaloké interrogé par CNC. Et ce n’est pas tout ! Certains dénoncent le vol et pillage de leur boutique par les mercenaires russes : « si tu n’as pas un gardien devant ton magasin, c’est sûr qu’ils vont le casser pour prendre des choses. Je ne suis pas seul ici, même mes voisins ont subi les mêmes dégâts », explique un jeune commerçant de Yaloké. Face à ce comportement des mercenaires russes, les soldats FACA et les gendarmes qui sont avec eux tentent de prévenir certains citoyens en langue nationale : « Heureusement j’ai été averti par un policier qui était avec eux. Ils m’ont dit de cacher mon téléphone portable rapidement sinon ils vont le récupérer », témoigne un citoyen du quartier Élevage à Bambari. La situation est de plus en plus inquiétante pour les habitants des villes conquises par les soldats FACA et les Russes si le gouvernement n’arrive pas à faire quelque chose pour que ces rackets et pillages de la population cessent. On se souvient encore de la ville de Boali ou un Motel construit par un paisible citoyen avait été littéralement pillé et saccagé par les mercenaires russes le mois dernier. « Ils peuvent démonter et emporter même les antennes paraboliques sur le toit d’une maison », s’alarme un habitant de Boali interrogé par CNC. Notons que les militaires rwandais ont également pris part aux combats au côté des soldats FACA et des Russes dans l’opération de reconquête des villes aux mains des rebelles, mais ils se comportent dignement, selon les dires des populations.

Face à la progression rapide des forces loyalistes, la panique s’empare de la ville de Bossangoa, et les activités commerciales et administratives sont aussi paralysées.

Ainsi, depuis vendredi matin, on signale des affrontements à une centaine de kilomètres de Bossangoa sur l’axe Bossembélé. L’objectif, reprendre symboliquement la ville de Bossangoa et ses environnants aux mains des rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement, et si possible traquer l’ancien Président François Bozizé qui serait retranché dans le coin. Selon le gouvernement, l’ancien Président François Bozizé serait l’auteur de trouble postélectoral qui secoue actuellement le pays depuis deux mois. En conséquence, il a été radié, ainsi que ses deux enfants, dans le rang de l’armée nationale. Retranché dans son fief de Bossangoa, l’ancien Président François Bozizé est sous le coup d’un mandat d’arrêt international de la justice centrafricaine pour son implication présumée dans la déstabilisation actuelle du pays.

D’après nos informations, les rebelles de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC), en provenance de Bangui, derrière les collines qui surplombent la capitale, sont nombreuses dans les localités de Lioto, Bolbala, Ngadza, Bianga, et nombreux sont aussi à Goya. « Je peux vous dire que c’est terrible ici. Le retour massif des combattants du CPC depuis Bangui aux pieds de la colline à pieds jusqu’à Kouango continue à nous faire peur. Ils sont nombreux à revenir. Certains ont continué à pied pour tenter de rentrer chez eux s’ils ne sont pas attaqués. D’autres sont encore là, attendant que la douleur des pieds enflés avec les longues marches disparaisse », soupire un habitant de Kouango interrogé par CNC. Selon un autre habitant, il est plus que nécessaire de faire recours à la force pour les chasser de la ville : « Ils sont encore nombreux ici. Si l’on ne les chasse pas par la force, ils ne vont pas quitter. Hors mis Lioto, ils sont aussi à Bolbala, Ngadza, Bianga, nombreux à Goya.

Photo renaissance. Bangui, République centrafricaine, lundi, 22 février 2021, 08:59:47 ( Corbeaunews-Centrafrique ). Incroyable, mais vrai ! L’ambassadeur plénipotentiaire de la Fédération de Russie près la République centrafricaine, Monsieur Vladimir TITTORENKO, a fait une sortie hasardeuse et peu diplomatique, pour ne pas dire surprenante après sa rencontre avec le chef de l’État Faustin Archange TOUADERA le 15 février au palais de la renaissance. Ceux-ci ne sont pas des propos diplomatiques, déclarent les observateurs. « Il n’est pas question de dialoguer avec François BOZIZÉ et encore moins avec Ali DARASSA, Al Khatim et le mouvement 3R qui ne sont pas des citoyens de la République centrafricaine ».Tel est le propos tenu par le diplomate russe Vladimir TITTORENKO à la presse présidentielle à la suite de sa rencontre avec le chef de l’État. D’après lui, la fédération de la Russie soutient seulement la concertation avec l’opposition démocratique et les forces vives de la nation. Or, pour de nombreux observateurs nationaux, l’ambassadeur russe semble aller loin des cadres diplomatiques, et tient des propos mêmes qui vont à l’encontre des chefs d’État de la communauté économique des États de l’Afrique centrale (CEEAC) et des Grands Lacs qui préconisent un dialogue s’insère entre les centrafricains sur la crise qui traverse leur pays en ce moment. En plus, le gouvernement, sur l’initiative de la fédération de la Russie, avait engagé des pourparlers avec ces chefs rebelles étrangers il y’a deux ans, et un accord politique pour la paix et la réconciliation avait été signé entre le gouvernement centrafricain et les 14 groupes armés, contre l’avis de la classe politique centrafricaine qui dénoncent un deal politique à but électoraliste. Et contre toute attente, durant deux ans, les chefs rebelles sont devenus des partenaires privilégiés du gouvernement, selon les propos du Premier ministre Firmin Ngrebada sur la radio France internationale (RFI). Mais voilà ! Deux ans plus tard, ces mêmes chefs rebelles, du moins sept d’entre eux, réunis au sein d’une coalition dénommée pompeusement CPC, ont tenté de renverser le pouvoir en place, poussant le chef de l’État à rompre ses relations avec eux. Pour ce dernier et les Russes, ce sont d’ailleurs l’ancien chef de l’État François Bozizé qui serait à l’origine de la création de la CPC, et donc il est inadmissible d’envisager un dialogue avec lui et ses chefs des groupes armés de la CPC. En plus, l’ambassadeur russe parle du dialogue avec la classe politique et les forces vives de la nation. Mais ce dialogue avait été souhaité par la classe politique depuis longtemps avant même les élections, mais le chef de l’État y s’oppose catégoriquement jusqu’à la pression de la CPC.

Les rebelles de l’unité pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC), membres de la coalition des patriotes pour le changement (CPC), ont affirmé à CNC avoir pris un mercenaire russe en otage, puis assassiné plusieurs d’autres dans les combats qui les ont opposé aux forces gouvernementales le 10 février à 10 kilomètres de Bambari sur l’axe Ippy. Le mercredi 10 février, vers 10 heures du matin, les soldats des forces armées centrafricaines (FACA), appuyées par les mercenaires russes de la société Wagner, ont mené une opération de démantèlement d’une barrière illégale érigée par les rebelles de l’unité pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC) au village Kombélé, situé à 10 kilomètres de Bambari centre sur l’axe Ippy. Au cours de cette opération des forces loyalistes, deux rebelles auraient été capturés, ce qui n’aurait pas plu à ses camarades rebelles qui ont contre-attaqué les positions des forces gouvernementales qui ont réussi à repoussé l’attaque, mais aussi mettre en déroute les assaillants qui ont du fuir leur principale base logistique et opérationnelle au profit des forces loyalistes qui renforcent désormais leur position dans le secteur, selon le gouvernement. Mais l’une de nos équipes, qui est arrivée sur le lieu, a constaté la présence toujours des rebelles de la CPC dans le secteur. « Le mercredi et jeudi dernier, il y’avait eu bel et bien un affrontement ici, mais nous avons mis en échec les mercenaires russes et leurs alliés », a indiqué un officier de la CPC interrogé par CNC. « Nous avons pris un mercenaire russe en otage, et assassiné plusieurs d’autres. Nous avons également détruit leur camion », poursuit-il. Cependant, à la Croix-Rouge et au MSF, on nous confirme qu’il y’avait eu bel et bien des corps qui sont amenés à la morgue ce jour, mais notre interlocuteur ne nous confirme pas le nombre exact. Pour l’heure, la tension est toujours vive entre les forces loyalistes et les rebelles à Bambari et ses localités. Mais dans un mémorandum adressé à la Minusca, une partie des habitants de Bambari demandent à la Minusca de prendre sa responsabilité pour la sécurisation de la population dans la ville. Elle dénonce les présumées « exactions » commises sur les civils par les mercenaires russes dans la ville et ses localités. Elle demande également le retrait des mercenaires russes de leur ville. D’après les signataires, les mercenaires russes ne sont intéressés que par le sous-sol du pays et non à la sécurisation de la population, comme témoigne leur intérêt pour la ville minière de Ndassima (exploitée par la société « MIDAS RESSOURCE », réputée proche de la Russie, mais aussi les localités de la Lobaye, où la forêt est exploitée par la société russe Lobaye Invest ».

145,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://corbeaunews-centrafrique.com/rca-wagner-ou-nerf-vague/,"Publié le 19 février 2021 , 5:14 Mis à jour le: 19 février 2021 5:14 Les instructeurs russes de la société Wagner à Bangui, CopyrightDR Bangui, République centrafricaine, vendredi, 19 février 2021, 10:08:10 ( Corbeaunews-Centrafrique ). Si beaucoup de mentions ont été faites dans la presse ces derniers jours quant à la progression des mercenaires de Wagner, il est étonnant de constater à quel point leurs échecs, leurs bavures et leurs pertes au combat sont passées sous silence. Et pourtant les constats illustrant le comportement douteux de ces mercenaires ne manquent pas et les médias centrafricains, en tout cas ceux qui ont su préserver leur indépendance éditoriale, se sont déjà fait l’écho des bavures de Wagner depuis bientôt deux mois que les combats avec la CPC ont débuté. Parler la langue du pays leurs serait en effet utile pour communiquer avec la population locale ou les humanitaires et éviter ainsi tout amalgame qui a causé les dommages collatéraux de ces dernières semaines parmi la population civile. Mais ce n’est pas une condition de recrutement, c’est fort dommage mais ce n’est pas le plus grave : ces chiens de guerre agiraient en dépit des lois internationales dont ils se moquaient. Ces soldats de l’enfer ne se posent-ils donc aucune question si ce qu’ils font est bien ou pas ? Comme le groupe Wagner n’est signataire d’aucune convention internationale, on peut se demander quelles règles ses mercenaires respectent ? Et surtout, s’ils viennent à les enfreindre, à qui rendront-ils des comptes ? Cela amène par ailleurs à s’interroger sur la constitution réelle de leurs effectifs et notamment sur la variété de nationalités représentées. Même si la majorité des mercenaires semblent bien être Russes, on en voit beaucoup qui sont loin du type « caucasien »… Les Syriens peut-être ? Libyens ? Recrutés partout où Wagner est déjà présent ? Normal qu’on soit dans le flou puisque la Russie a plusieurs fois démenti la présence de combattants lui appartenant en Centrafrique. Depuis fin décembre, les FACA comme les rebelles de la CPC témoignent de mercenaires Wagner qu’ils voient blessés ou tués sur le terrain. Au milieu des nombreux témoignages, provenant de différentes sources, il est difficile d’établir un bilan précis. Les blessés et les morts se compteraient toutefois par dizaines. Pourtant, il n’y a aucune communication des chefs de Wagner, aucun hommage, aucune image des cercueils… Que font-ils de leurs morts ? En aparté, certains blessés de Wagner se plaignent des conditions dans lesquelles ils ont été pris en charge, surtout en province. Avec ses mystères, que cherche à cacher le groupe Wagner ? Si la guerre et l’argent sont les deux motivations d’un mercenaire, agissent-ils pour leurs propres intérêts privés ou pour les Centrafricains ? Qui nous assure que la symphonie de Wagner pour ramener la paix en Centrafrique ne se transformera pas en cacophonie pour le peuple centrafricain ?

Sputnik France https://fr.sputniknews.com/afrique/202103131045343643-la-russie-sabstient-de-voter-pour-laugmentation-des-effectifs-des-forces-de-paix-de-lonu-en/ Alors que le Conseil de sécurité de l'Onu a approuvé vendredi 12 mars une résolution prévoyant d'augmenter de près de 3.000 Casques bleus les effectifs de la MINUSCA en Centrafrique, seule la Russie s’est abstenue de voter, appelant à ne pas «saper le principe de respect de la souveraineté nationale» et à coordonner les actions avec Bangui. La Russie est le seul pays à s'être abstenu de voter pour la résolution visant à augmenter les effectifs des Nations unies en Centrafrique, indique une déclaration publiée le 12 mars sur le site de la Mission permanente de la Fédération de Russie auprès de l'Onu. «Moscou a été déçu par le fait que les auteurs du projet ont décidé de ne pas mentionner dans le texte les principes directeurs des Nations unies pour la fourniture d'une aide humanitaire conformément à la résolution 46/182 de l'Assemblée générale. Garantir les conditions pour la fourniture de l'aide humanitaire est une partie importante du mandat de la MINUSCA [mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations unies pour la stabilisation en Centrafrique, ndlr]», indique le communiqué. La Russie n'accepte pas que des pays occidentaux s’évertuent à «retirer des documents de l'Onu les références aux principes directeurs de l'Onu sur l'aide humanitaire». La mission permanente a accusé ses «collègues occidentaux» de «porter atteinte à la sévérité des paramètres de l'aide humanitaire», ce qui pourrait conduire à «saper le principe de respect de la souveraineté nationale». Une coordination étroite avec Bangui recommandée Moscou continue de considérer qu'il est nécessaire de se coordonner étroitement avec les gouvernements des pays bénéficiaires pour l'acheminement de l' assistance humanitaire sur leur territoire. «Nous sommes également fermement convaincus que lors de la sélection des effectifs de la MINUSCA dans le cadre de l'augmentation du nombre de soldats de la paix, le secrétariat de l'Onu devrait se coordonner étroitement avec Bangui et écouter l'opinion des Centrafricains, notamment en ce qui concerne la composition nationale des troupes et de la police envoyées», ajoute le communiqué. Le motif de la France Selon la résolution adoptée vendredi 12 mars par 14 membres sur les 15, le Conseil de sécurité de l'Onu décide d'augmenter les effectifs de la composante militaire de la MINUSCA de 2.750 personnes et d'augmenter le nombre de la composante police de la mission de 940 personnes. Jusqu'à présent, la MINUSCA comprenait 11.650 militaires et 2.080 policiers. Dans un communiqué, l'ambassadeur français à l'Onu, Nicolas de Rivière, a assuré que «cette résolution donne à la MINUSCA les moyens de continuer à remplir son mandat pour protéger les civils et faciliter l'accès humanitaire». «Derrière ce chiffre de 3.690 personnels, le Conseil de sécurité valide un plan pour améliorer les capacités de la MINUSCA, à travers notamment la fourniture de matériels spécifiques tels que des hélicoptères», a-t-il précisé. Des tensions en Centrafrique La décision de l'Onu intervient deux jours avant la tenue dimanche 14 mars d'un deuxième tour d' élections législatives en Centrafrique. Mi-décembre, 6 des 14 groupes armés qui occupaient deux tiers du pays depuis le début de la guerre civile en 2013, avaient lancé une offensive contre le Président Faustin Archange Touadéra, réélu fin décembre. Vladimir Monteiro, porte-parole de la MINUSCA, a déclaré le 20 décembre que les rebelles avaient été bloqués ou repoussés dans plusieurs localités. Puis, le 20 janvier, les soldats de la paix, ainsi que l'armée centrafricaine, ont évincé les paramilitaires de la quatrième ville la plus importante du pays, Bambari. Une aide de Moscou À la suite de la montée des violences attribuées aux groupes rebelles, les autorités de Bangui ont demandé l'aide de Moscou, 300 instructeurs supplémentaires et quatre hélicoptères Mi-8 avec équipages et ingénieurs de maintenance y ont été envoyés le 22 décembre. Selon le ministère russe des Affaires étrangères, la Russie en avait préalablement informé le comité du Conseil de sécurité de l'Onu pour les sanctions contre la Centrafrique. Les instructeurs russes avaient pour mission de former les soldats de l’armée nationale de Centrafrique chargés de garantir la sécurité à la veille et pendant les élections générales du 27 décembre. Le ministère russe de la Défense a en outre annoncé avoir fourni des blindés de reconnaissance BRDM-2 à la République centrafricaine. Le ministère russe de la Défense a retiré les quatre hélicoptères Mi-8 déployés en République centrafricaine pour la période électorale, mais la mission des 300 instructeurs récemment envoyés dans ce pays pour former l’armée locale sera prolongée, a annoncé le 27 janvier le ministère russe des Affaires étrangères. ...

149,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56585731,"China is 'trampling on Hong Kong's democracy' By Andreas Illmer image copyrightReuters image captionAuthorities seek to intimidate dissenters, critics warn China's overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system is being seen as a watershed moment by those who fear Beijing's encroaching influence on the city. Recent changes ensure that only ""patriots"" loyal to the mainland can end up in positions of power. To those hoping Hong Kong might move towards greater democracy, it feels like the final blow. The US, Australia and European countries condemned China's actions, but it has been harder to gauge the reactions in Hong Kong itself. Many people simply don't want to talk anymore. In fact, over the past few years it has become harder and harder to get ordinary people to speak their mind about the city's relationship with the mainland. 'That's how authoritarian regimes work' Sharing that observation with a friend in Hong Kong, the response was a cynical ""Lol"", with a sober afterthought: ""That's how authoritarian regimes work."" Lee Jonghyuk, an assistant professor at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, told the BBC that sensitive topics of conversation would ""naturally perish"" under these kinds of circumstances. ""People will self-censor themselves, and this is intentional,"" he said. ""Most likely, the Chinese Communist Party will destroy social trust among citizens by incentivizing more people on the street to report criticism to the government."" So what is it like in patriotic Hong Kong, and what do people expect in the future? image copyrightEPA image captionProtests like in 2019 are likely a thing of the past 'Turning Hong Kong back 20 years' Opposition politicians - those most directly affected by the change - are still speaking up, at least for the time being. The changes will put Hong Kong ""20 odd years back,"" warned Lo Kin-hei, the chairman of the opposition Democratic Party. He told the BBC that any progress over the past two decades had essentially been erased by Beijing. ""We know that the space for us to participate is much less than before, and we know that it is very difficult to get through the vetting system,"" he said, referring to the system which will in future decide who can run for office. Lo Kin-hei's party treasurer, Ramon Yuen Hoi-man, said that China's leadership was ""trampling on democracy"" and breaking with the vision of universal suffrage spelled out in the city's constitution, the Basic Law. media captionLo Kin-hei: This is turning Hong Kong back 20 years Lo Kin-hei and other pro-democracy forces now face a difficult discussion over whether they will keep on participating in the election ""or whether we will go another way"". Professor Lee, from Nanyang Technological University, said there may simply be no avenues left for political or public influence. ""I think that it is too late,"" he said. ""China's leadership will never give in to the public. It will never revert their decisions even with the international pressure."" Talking to people on the ground is more difficult, but not impossible. ""We can hear a lot of people discussing leaving the city now,"" said Ken Liu, who works in the city's IT sector. He said he planned to stay - ""And as long as I can find any legal way to spread my views, I will do it"" - but he said he feared many would leave Hong Kong for good. The UK has already opened a pathway out by allowing people born before the handover to get onto a special visa scheme that can lead to British citizenship. media captionThe exiles: Hong Kong at a crossroads Yet that's a costly option for many, warned Professor Lee. For most ordinary Kong Kong residents, it will simply be not possible to uproot and leave. And while many might be unhappy with the changes forced by Beijing, ""political rights are not essential for living"". ""There is an argument of 'political bargains for economic benefits,'"" he explains, pointing to mainland China where citizens have also made their peace to have political rights withheld as long as the leadership brings about economic prosperity. 'Hong Kong will prosper' Finding voices that support China's changes is already a lot easier than finding open dissent. Penny Sun is an online influencer with thousands of followers on social media. She told the BBC she fully backs the changes and that Hong Kong's political figures should be ""patriots"" and do the same. She said she enjoyed more freedom now than she did during the long months of the 2019 protests that she described as ""riots"". ""During the riots I was afraid that I could be attacked for speaking my mind, I was scared something could happen to me,"" she said. image copyrightPenny Sun image captionPoliticians should be 'patriots', said influencer Penny Sun She said during the time of the protests those who supported China avoided talking about politics in order not to run into trouble. ""That was not Hong Kong as we knew it,"" she said. She said ""patriotic"" politicians would still be free to discuss the topics that matter and are much closer to people's lives, such as the city's pressing housing problem. ""Hong Kong will prosper and our lives will be more stable."" Others fear this will only be true for those whose views align with China's, and not for those who dissent. Beijing's fear of a chain reaction Many in Hong Kong, as well as observers from abroad, have been shocked by the speed with which the recent drastic changes have taken place. From the introduction last year of the much-criticised ""national security law"" - which criminalised secession, subversion and ""collusion with foreign forces"", and carries a life sentence - to the recent electoral changes. And yet Professor Lee said he had expected those changes to come even faster. The Chinese leadership was ""quite afraid of a domestic chain reaction if it would give in to Hong Kong"", he said. ""Surprisingly, Beijing trusted Hong Kong's government's ability to deal with the protesters,"" he added. ""However, when the second mass protests happened in 2019, the Communist leadership decided to engage directly in Hong Kong issues to eliminate the sources of collective actions, such as democratic representations, civil networks, and education systems."" Two years later, speaking out against Beijing has been made illegal and opposition politicians can be easily kept out of parliament. ""There will be no reversion,"" Professor Lee said. ""This is quite certain. Universal suffrage is a mere obstacle to the stability of the Communist Party's regime."" media captionIn 2019, How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Additional reporting by Jeff Li and Cho Wai Lam.

150,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56607815,"'The grim reality of reporting in China that pushed me out’ By John Sudworth media captionThe BBC's John Sudworth: ""Intensifying attempts to obstruct and harass us wherever we film"" It was a reminder of the grim reality of reporting in China to the very end. As my family scrambled to the airport - late and unprepared from the last-minute packing - we were watched outside our home by plainclothes police, who then followed us to the airport and tailed us through check-in. True to form to the very end, China's propaganda machine has been at full throttle, denying I faced any risks in China, while simultaneously making those risks abundantly clear. ""The Foreign Ministry said they are not aware that Sudworth was under any threat,"" the Communist Party controlled Global Times said, ""except that he may be sued by individuals in Xinjiang over his slanderous reports."" The chilling effect of such statements lies in the reality of a court system run - like the media - as an extension of the Communist Party, with the idea of an independent judiciary dismissed as ""an erroneous Western notion"". The disinformation tactics used by China China's ministry of foreign affairs has continued the attacks, using the podium at its daily press briefing on Thursday to criticise what it called the BBC's ""fake news"". It played a video clip from our recent interview with Volkswagen in China over its decision to operate a car plant in Xinjiang, suggesting that this ""is the kind of report that triggers the anger of the Chinese people"". It's an unlikely claim, of course, given that the vast majority of the Chinese people cannot see any of our reporting, which has long been blocked. But while all of this has brought my posting to a fraught and fretful end, it is worth remembering that mine is just the latest in a long line of foreign media departures in recent years . And it is part of a far bigger battle that China is waging over the global space for ideas and information. Media becomes battleground ""Economic freedom creates habits of liberty,"" former US President George W Bush once said in a speech urging China's acceptance into the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ""And habits of liberty create expectations of democracy,"" he continued. That starry-eyed assumption - that as China grew richer it would grow freer - could still frequently be heard in news analysis and academic discussion of China when I first began working here in 2012. But my arrival that year coincided with a development that has come to make that prediction seem utterly naïve - the appointment of Xi Jinping to the most powerful job in the country, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. image copyrightEPA image captionChina's President Xi Jinping has been tightening control over society since he took office 10 years ago While the huge shift in global trading patterns over the years has undoubtedly changed China - unleashing a whirlwind of economic and social change - those expectations of democracy appear further away than ever. President Xi has used China's already rigid political system to tighten control over almost every aspect of society, and 10 years into his now open-ended tenure, it is the media landscape that has emerged as the defining battleground. ""Document Number 9"" - reportedly a high-level leak - identified early on the main targets in that fight: ""Western values"", including freedom of the press. And, as the BBC's experience shows, any foreign journalism that exposes truths about the situation in Xinjiang , questions China's handling of the coronavirus and its origins , or gives voice to opponents of its authoritarian plans for Hong Kong , is now firmly in the firing line. Undermining democratic debate But as China's propaganda attacks continue in the wake of my departure, it is also notable that foreign social media networks are being used extensively to amplify the message. image copyrightTwitter The irony is, of course, that at the same time that the space for foreign journalism is shrinking in China, the Communist Party has been investing heavily in its media strategy overseas, taking full advantage of the easy access to a free and open media. Its ""wolf-warrior"" diplomats unleash furious tweet-storms , lambasting foreign reporting - while denying their own citizens access to those very same foreign platforms - in an intensive, co-ordinated strategy across multiple platforms, as documented by this report by researchers from the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute . State-media propagandists publish and post their content overseas without restriction, while at home, China ruthlessly shuts down independent reporting, censors foreign broadcasts and websites, and blocks foreign journalists from its own social media networks. image copyrightTwitter In this context, my departure can be seen as one small part of an emerging and highly asymmetric battle for the control of ideas. It is not a happy prospect for the free flow of good, accurate information. Decreasing access will undermine our ability to understand what is really happening in China, while at the same time, it is is harnessing the power of the institutions of a free press to undermine democratic debate everywhere. Footprints that lead to the truth While there are no easy answers, and the idealism of President Bush's prediction has long since evaporated, there is some room for hope. Much of the information that has been revealed in recent years about the truth of what is happening in Xinjiang has - despite China's dismissal of it as ""fake"" - been based on its own internal documents and propaganda reports. Investigating China's hidden camps in Xinjiang In the running of a system of mass incarceration, a modern, digital superpower cannot help but leave footprints online, and the important journalistic effort to uncover them will continue from afar. I join a growing number of foreign correspondents now forced to cover the China story from Taipei, or other cities in Asia and beyond. image captionJohn Sudworth (seen here) and his team were followed and had their footage deleted on a trip to Xinjiang in late 2020 And of course, while depleted in number, there are brave, determined members of the foreign press corps in China who remain committed to telling the story. Most remarkably, within the tightening confines of the political controls, there are also the few extraordinary Chinese citizens who, at enormous personal danger, find ways round the censorship to do the most important job in journalism anywhere - telling the story of their country in their own words. Much of what we know about the early days of the Wuhan lockdown came from these citizen journalists, who are today paying the price for that bravery. I am able to leave the plain-clothes police, for the final time I hope, in the departure hall of a Beijing airport. In the new global battle for ideas, we should never forget that it is China's citizens who continue to face the greatest risks for telling the truth.

151,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56574336,"image copyrightReuters image captionChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, signed the deal China and Iran signed a deal over the weekend that their foreign ministers said was designed as a strategic partnership to last for the next quarter of a century. The details have not been published yet, but the assumption is that China, in defiance of American sanctions, will buy Iranian oil. It will, in turn, invest some of its wealth in Iran. Sanctions have starved Iran of foreign investment. It is the latest extension to China's vast infrastructure project, the Belt and Road initiative, which is creating the connections Beijing needs to continue its expansion as a global power. Some Iranians were suspicious of China's motives when a draft of the co-operation agreement was leaked last year. Belt and Road deals are intended to benefit China most of all. Some that looked attractive have turned sour when smaller, poorer countries (and most countries are smaller and poorer than China) found they were in out of their depth. Iran - smaller than China, but still a big country with huge natural resources and an activist foreign policy - is a different proposition. image copyrightEPA image captionUS sanctions have succeeded in scaring away foreign investment in Iran's economy The new deal will feed into Iran's face-off with the United States. Both Iran and the Biden administration in Washington have declared that they would like the US to rejoin the agreement regulating Iran's nuclear activities, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Former President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018 and tried unsuccessfully to destroy it, claiming that far from stopping Iran getting a nuclear weapon it made the process much easier. Both the Iranians and the Americans have been staring each other out, unprepared to be the one that blinks first in the negotiation. Now that Iran has signed a strategic accord with China, which is also a party to the JCPOA, it will be hoping for more than simply increased oil sales, vital as they are to an economy that has been badly damaged by sanctions. The deal should give Iran more leverage with the US. media captionWhat China's One Belt, One Road really means President Biden, like his two predecessors, has tried to ""pivot"" away from the Middle East to the lucrative and strategically important Asia-Pacific region. In practice, it has been impossible, as there is too much in the Middle East that the US considers vital to its interests. One of those agenda items is Iran, and the nuclear ambitions that it claims not to have. While the US has not performed its longed-for pivot and pulled back, it has not pushed forward either. Its reluctance to dig any deeper holes for itself in the Middle East has opened up opportunities for its rivals. Russia saw space to revive the Soviet Union's old role by intervening in Syria. China believes that the US is in a long-term, irreversible decline. It sees itself as the world's rising power of the 21st Century and beyond. A power of that magnitude cannot ignore the Middle East. image copyrightReuters image captionChina's foreign minister also visited three other countries in the Gulf, including the United Arab Emirates Strategic co-operation in the Gulf might have more significance for China's long-term ambitions than any short-term benefit banked by Iran. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's Middle East tour was not confined to Tehran for the signing ceremony. China Daily, an organ of the Chinese Communist Party, reports that he unveiled a five-point plan ""for achieving security and stability in the Middle East by offering constructive boosts to Palestine-Israel dialogue, resuming the Iran nuclear deal and building a security framework in this region"". image copyrightAFP image captionChina opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017 That is the kind of thing that Western diplomats say too. But the US has seen the Middle East as its preserve since the end of the Cold War. It has resisted allowing its allies in the European Union much of a role beyond signing cheques. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has already built its first overseas military base on the Red Sea, in Djibouti. It overlooks one of the world's busiest shipping lanes and is only 10km (six miles) away from the home of the US military's Africa Command. Could Beijing be planning something similar on Iran's Gulf coast, giving it a naval foothold in what the US Navy has regarded as its own lake? Joe Biden and his administration might find a way back into the JCPOA. They judge it is in their best interests. They will be much more uneasy about signs that China, as its rise gathers pace, is jostling its way into the world's most unstable region.

Last month, China banned Taiwanese pineapple imports, citing the risk of “harmful creatures” that could affect its own crops. The move infuriated Taiwan’s leaders, who said the move had nothing to do with bugs, and was instead an example of China ramping up political pressure on the island, which Beijing considers a province of China. In response, Taiwan’s leaders sought out new customers overseas, and asked locals to eat what Chinese consumers no longer could. “Taiwanese pineapples are stronger than fighter jets. Geopolitical pressures cannot squeeze their deliciousness,” declared Taiwan’s Vice President Lai Ching-te, in a tweet. According to Taiwan’s Council of Agriculture, the island produces 420,000 tonnes of pineapple annually, and exported a little over 10% of that last year, with almost all of it going to China. Without mainland sales, Taiwanese growers face a possible glut of pineapples, and with it a danger that prices might fall. Taiwan reports 'large incursion' by Chinese war jets Freedom pineapples President Tsai Ing-wen launched a “pineapple challenge” on social media, aimed at getting Taiwanese consumers to buy more of the fruit. After Australian wine, unfair Chinese trade practices are now targeting #Taiwanese ????pineapples????. But that won’t stop us.

The Canadian Trade Office in Taipei posted a photo of staff posing around a pineapple pizza, with a polite reminder that it was Canada’s idea rather than Hawaii’s. “We in the Canadian Office like pineapple pizza, especially pineapples from Taiwan!” the post said. Japanese consumers might have made the biggest difference, with orders for 5,000 tonnes coming from Japan, Ms Tsai said. I'm touched by all the support for our pineapple????farmers, both from the #Taiwanese people & our friends around the world. 台湾のパイナップルはまもなく本格的な収穫期を迎えます。これから美味しいパイナップルが日本にどんどん輸出されます。日本の皆さん、どうぞ宜しくお願いします！ pic.twitter.com/owHdupFK0X — 蔡英文 Tsai Ing-wen (@iingwen) March 17, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Now I love its juicy sweet taste,” one user wrote . Within just a few days the Taiwanese government’s campaign led to enough orders to cover the pineapples that would have been exported to China. That still leaves the 90% of pineapples growers usually sell domestically, so they will be hoping that consumers don’t get sick of the taste. Yang Yufan, a well-known organic pineapple grower from Southern Taiwan, has become known as the ""pineapple prince"". He told BBC Chinese that in recent years Taiwanese growers had gravitated to the Chinese market, because inspections were easier and faster than in other markets like Japan. But he said Taiwan's agriculture sector needed to diversify because too much of its exports go to mainland China. ""The pineapples we hope to harvest next year will [have been] sown last year, so the problems we will face next year may be even greater,"" he said. image copyrightYang Yu-Fan image captionYang Yufan, a well-known organic pineapple grower from Southern Taiwan Foreign pests and diseases China insists the pineapples were blocked because its customs authorities had repeatedly detected pests on fruit coming from Taiwan. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, described it as a normal biosafety precaution measure. However, over the past 12 months China has been accused of using ambiguous and opaque trade policies to punish its rivals. Australian agricultural producers in particular worry that their products have been subject to unofficial bans or unreasonable new standards, as retribution for Australian government policies. Ms Tsai flatly dismisses China’s claims, pointing out that 99.97% of imported pineapple batches passed inspection. media caption""Taiwan is a war and peace issue for China"" Biosecurity is an unusually tricky area, because introduced species can cause real economic damage, but there is a long history of using it as a weapon in trade disputes. “Some of these concerns are genuinely driven by legitimate worries over the possible introduction of foreign pests and diseases against which most native species may have no defences at all,” said Deborah Elms from the Asian Trade Centre. “But rules over what are called sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues can also be a fairly easy way to block foreign trade.” The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (Unctad) database shows that China has 1,642 SPS restrictions, which is more than any country except for India, the US, Panama and Peru. But those numbers should be treated with caution, said Ms Elms, as they are not qualitative. One poorly framed rule might be more restrictive than dozens of less onerous restrictions.

It said hackers used malicious websites and apps to infect devices and allow for remote surveillance, with journalists and activists targeted. A majority of the cyber attacks didn't happen directly on Facebook but used the social media platform to share links to infected sites. This is not the first time hackers have been accused of such activity. The Uighurs are originally from the north-western region of Xinjiang in China and those targeted are currently living in places including Turkey, the United States, Australia and Canada. ""This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while obfuscating who's behind it,"" Facebook's Mike Dvilyanski, head of cyber espionage investigations, and Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy, said in a blog post . Facebook said it removed accounts - which totalled fewer than 100 - it found to have been created by the hackers, a group known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. It believes fewer than 500 accounts were targeted. Facebook says some of the ways the group infected devices included: creating fake Uighur-themed apps for the Android app store, including a prayer app and a dictionary app posing on Facebook as journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the Uighur community, building trust and tricking them into clicking on malicious links creating look-alike websites for popular Uighur and Turkish news websites The Chinese Embassy in Washington has yet to comment.

The report, released Tuesday by the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy think tank in Washington DC, claimed the Chinese government ""bears state responsibility for an ongoing genocide against the Uyghur in breach of the (UN) Genocide Convention."" It is the first time a non-governmental organization has undertaken an independent legal analysis of the accusations of genocide in Xinjiang, including what responsibility Beijing may bear for the alleged crimes. An advance copy of the report was seen exclusively by CNN. Up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to have been placed in a sprawling network of detention centers across the region, according to the US State Department, where former detainees allege they were subjected to indoctrination, sexually abused and even forcibly sterilized. China denies allegations of human rights abuses, saying the centers are necessary to prevent religious extremism and terrorism. A Chinese flag flies outside the east gate of the Old City in Kashgar, Xinjiang, on November 8, 2018. Speaking at a press conference on March 7 , Foreign Minister Wang Yi said allegations of a genocide in Xinjiang ""couldn't be more preposterous."" Read More On January 19, the outgoing Trump administration declared the Chinese government was committing genocide in Xinjiang. A month later, the Dutch and Canadian parliaments passed similar motions despite opposition from their leaders. Azeem Ibrahim, director of special initiatives at Newlines and co-author of the new report, said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence to support its allegation of genocide. ""This is a major global power, the leadership of which are the architects of a genocide,"" he said. This photo taken on June 4, 2019 shows a facility believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, north of Akto in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. Genocide Convention The four-page UN Genocide Convention was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 and has a clear definition of what constitutes ""genocide."" China is a signatory to the convention, along with 151 other countries. Article II of the convention states genocide is an attempt to commit acts ""with an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" There are five ways in which genocide can take place, according to the convention: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Since the convention was introduced in 1948, most convictions for genocide have occurred in the International Criminal Tribunals held by the UN, such as those for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, or in national courts. In 2006, former dictator Saddam Hussein was found guilty of genocide in a court in Iraq. However any establishment of an International Criminal Tribunal would require the approval of the UN Security Council, of which China is a permanent member with veto power, making any hearing on the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang unlikely. While violating just one act in the Genocide Convention would constitute a finding of genocide, the Newlines report claims the Chinese government has fulfilled all criteria with its actions in Xinjiang. ""China's policies and practices targeting Uyghurs in the region must be viewed in their totality, which amounts to an intent to destroy the Uyghurs as a group, in whole or in part,"" the report claimed. A separate report published on February 8 by Essex Court Chambers in London, which was commissioned by the World Uyghur Congress and the Uyghur Human Rights Project, reached a similar conclusion that there is a ""credible case"" against the Chinese government for genocide. No specific penalties or punishments are laid out in the convention for states or governments determined to have committed genocide. But the Newlines report said that under the convention, the other 151 signatories have a responsibility to act. ""China's obligations ... to prevent, punish and not commit genocide are erga omnes, or owed to the international community as a whole,"" the report added.

The park, which is expected to generate approximately 60,000 jobs, is pivotal to Jamaica's Logistics Hub Initiative (LHI), development of which is being spearheaded by the Jamaica Special Economic Zone Authority (JSEZA). It is one of the three largest being developed by the Authority. The others are the Caymanas Special Economic Zone in St Catherine, and Vernamfield Aerotropolis in Clarendon. Work on the park's development is expected to get under way by year end. Chairman of the JSEZA, Metry Seaga, provided details during a media briefing at the Authority, Waterloo Road, St. Andrew, on Wednesday (June 20). Seaga said the park's phased development will involve the establishment of a bauxite/alumina refinery and an electricity plant to power this and other businesses that are set up; and a smelter that will underpin JISCO's focus on manufacturing aluminium and its by-products locally. “I think it is important that we, as Jamaicans, understand the game changer that this is going to be. It is going to transform, not only St. Elizabeth, but all the towns around it. Most importantly, this has the backing of the Government of the People's Republic of China. This is real and we are going to make it happen,” the Chairman said. Meanwhile, Seaga, who indicated that this is part of a wider project targeting housing developments, said JISCO has given an undertaking that liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be utilised to generate power. “(They) made it very clear that this is not going to be a concrete jungle… and that they are going to make sure that this is ecologically friendly… with lots of green space. So, that's encouraging,” he added. Meanwhile, JSEZA Chief Executive Officer, Dr Eric Deans, said the key summary findings of the Logistics Hub Initiative Master Plan, which was recently endorsed by Cabinet, articulate the creation of three new towns around these SEZs that will impact 75,000 households and 220,000 residents, “but, more importantly, a market reach of 80 million people”.

The facility is a gift from the Government of the People's Republic of China and will have 220 beds. It will be the first of its kind in the English-speaking Caribbean, offering specialist medical care for youngsters up to age 18 years. Funding for the project is being provided under an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, which was signed on Thursday, October 18 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, New Kingston, by portfolio minister Kamina Johnson Smith, on behalf of the Jamaican Government; and China's Ambassador to Jamaica Tian Qi. Prime Minister Andrew Holness, who broke ground for the facility, said he was happy with design of the hospital, arguing that the way in which some buildings are constructed in Jamaica poses huge problems which impact health. Minister of Health and Wellness Dr Christopher Tufton, who welcomed the construction of the facility, said it will be the first hospital to be built in the country in two decades. “In terms of this regional health authority geographic space it is 500,000 people who will be served in this region, comprising St James, Westmoreland, Trelawny and Hanover,“ said Dr Tufton. He added: “The Western Children and Adolescents Hospital is a significant indication of the commitment of our honourable prime minister and the Administration to advance the improvement of public health infrastructure.” “Today is a good day for the people of Jamaica and the relationship between Jamaica and the people of China,” Dr Tufton said. Ambassador Qi, at the same time, noted that the construction of the facility, which is expected to be completed in two years, is a testament of the friendship between Kingston and Beijing. “For the past 47 years we have been working together as true friend and real partners,” said the Chinese ambassador. Mayor of Montego Bay Councillor Homer Davis also commended the Chinese Government for its generous contribution of the well- needed paediatric and adolescents hospital in western Jamaica. Meanwhile, Holness, who argued that “credit must be given where credit is due”, praised former Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller for initiating the partnership with the Chinese Government for the construction of the public health care facility. “The concept of having the paediatric adolescents hospital didn't start with her (Simpson Miller), obviously something that was always conceptualised, but she brought it a step closer when she visited China [in 2013] and placed it on the agenda as a project of cooperation between Jamaica and the people of China. The Government of China agreed and that brought the project one step closer to fruition. So I want to acknowledge her great effort and input in reaching to this point,” Holness remarked under heavy rain beating down on the tent under which the ground-breaking ceremony was held. The heavy rains also forced the ground-breaking to be done under the tent. Now you can read the Jamaica Observer ePaper anytime, anywhere.

167,SCOPE_S_1 - Online news article,https://www.worldhighways.com/wh10/feature/el-sillar-bolivias-challenging-road-project,"El Sillar – Bolivia’s challenging road project El Sillar – Bolivia’s challenging road project Construction of Bolivia’s El Sillar highway, the country’s most complicated road project – Mauro Nogarin reports Road Structures / February 6, 2020 3 mins Read SHARE By Mauro Nogarin The earthmoving portion of the work will be carried out in several phases and includes building cuttings and retaining walls Since the 1970s, drivers of vehicles have been suffering regular delays due to landslides on the El Sillar highway in Bolivia, connecting Santa Cruz with Cochabamba. A section of the route suffers badly from geological instability and it has a difficult topography. A particular problem comes from the stretches with rocky slopes during the rainy season, as there are frequent rockfalls onto the road, which pose a hazard to drivers and block the highway. The section of El Sillar located between kilometres 100 and 128 of the Cochabamba - Santa Cruz route forms part of the East-West Bioceanic Corridor and crosses a number of towns belonging to Chapare Province in Cochabamba Department. Widening the route will contribute to the area’s economy, providing a new transport corridor and boosting trade between Bolivia and its neighbouring countries, Brazil, Peru and Chile. This improved route will also boost connectivity for Bolivia, speeding transport between its eastern and western borders, becoming a main part of the interoceanic corridor. Likewise, it will contribute to the national development, especially to the department of Cochabamba and eastern Bolivia, since it is its main export route and links with the rest of the departments. The dual carriageway will provide better traffic flow at all times of the year, as well as reducing wear and tear on vehicles. It will also help develop the local agricultural sector, producing bananas, citrus fruits, avocado, corn and ginger. The Bolivian road authority, Administrator Bolivia de Carreteras (ABC), called for the El Sillar dual carriageway to be built to a higher standard than the existing route to improve traffic flow and reduce danger and disruptions from rockfalls. The project to upgrade the El Sillar route to a dual carriageway includes building 28 bridges, two tunnels and a number of retaining walls with a total length of 6km. These will be used to pass through the stretches suffering from landslides and rockfalls on a 30km stretch with the worst geological instability. The contract to build the El Sillar was awarded to the Chinese contractor Sinohydro Corporation for US$426 million. Work began in mid-June 2018 and it is expected that the project will be delivered in March 2021. One of the conditions of the package is that the contractor is responsible for all of the work and there are no subcontracts involved in the project. From a financial point of view, 85% of the necessary funding requirement was provided by Eximbank of China. Meanwhile, the remaining 15% has been provided on a counterpart basis by Bolivia’s government. In all, the 28 bridges total 6km in length. The bridges include nine large structures, the San Jacinto, Mayu Crystal, Limatambo, Anchu Mayu, Antahuacana, Thuyu Mayu, Chuamayu and the Holy Spirit I and II bridges. These nine bridges require the installation of more than 190 piles, in difficult conditions due to the rain. The earthmoving work will be carried out in different phases that will last until 2021, and a total of 6 million m3 of earth will be moved.The first phase of the earthmoving work also includes the construction of five major structures to support the roadway. Another key element for this project has been the boring of the two tunnel stretches. One of the tunnels is 1,025m in length while the other is 765m long. The contractor, Sinohydro, started by building the portals, then bored through from the ends. These two underground routes will help boost safety for traffic travelling through the El Sillar area, particularly in the rainy season when the risk of rockfalls and landslides is at its highest. According to the new design developed by the Sinohydro engineers, the dual carriageway is being built with four 7m-wide lanes. This allows for two lanes of traffic in both directions. The design also features a 2m external berm and a central dividing strip 1m-wide. The dual carriageway is being built with both asphalt and concrete surfaces in different stretches, to best suit the conditions. The contractor, Sinohydro, commenced the project by carrying out clearing of vegetation, cutting the slopes and building necessary drainage.

Geremew is part of a new generation of African scientists whose prospects are expanding as their governments team up with foreign powers on a potential fast-track to electrification. For now, South Africa is the only country on the continent operating a nuclear power plant. But in recent years, at least seven other sub-Saharan African states have signed agreements to deploy nuclear power with backing from Russia, according to public announcements and the World Nuclear Association (WNA), an industry body. Geremew first heard about the ambitious nuclear deal Ethiopia had struck with Moscow on the television news two years ago. The next day, his university department was buzzing with talk about it. Ethiopia’s memorandum of understanding on nuclear cooperation with Russia paves the way for the construction of a nuclear power plant and a research reactor in the long term, said Frehiwot Woldehanna, Ethiopia’s state minister for the energy sector. The East African country has been electrifying rapidly to meet rising energy demand and its own goal to become the biggest power exporter on the continent, while sticking to pledges to remain a low emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Under a 2015-2020 development plan, Addis Ababa wants to raise power generation to more than 17,000 megawatts (MW) from current capacity of just over 4,200 MW, mainly by harnessing hydro, wind and geothermal sources. Its most ambitious project under construction is the Grand Renaissance Dam on the Nile river that will churn out 6,000 MW at full capacity when completed within the next four years, according to Ethiopian Electric Power, the state-owned utility. But Woldehanna worries about betting on an abundance of water for the country’s main source of electricity, as droughts become more frequent. With rivers sometimes drying up, “you cannot fully rely on hydropower”, he said, adding that nuclear technologies have “environmental” advantages over others. Plans for a nuclear power plant in Ethiopia remain at the “pre-feasibility stage”, but the country is serious about building one, he emphasized. ‘ATOMS FOR AFRICA’ With sub-Saharan Africa’s 48 countries generating the same amount of power as Spain, despite a population 18 times larger, the option to bring electricity access to their people on a bigger scale using nuclear energy is gaining momentum. Nearly six out of 10 sub-Saharan Africans still lack access to electricity, according to World Bank data. Like Ethiopia, emerging nuclear states Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia and Ghana have signed agreements with Russia’s state nuclear corporation, ROSATOM - most since 2016. Their content ranges from language on the construction of nuclear reactors to assistance with feasibility studies and personnel training, press statements show. ROSATOM’s solutions for managing spent fuel and radioactive waste vary from country to country, but are normally worked out at the later stages of a nuclear new-build program “in the strictest compliance with international law”, a spokeswoman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Chinese state-owned nuclear firms have also taken the lead in the region, sealing deals with Kenya, Sudan and Uganda, WNA data shows. South African student Masamaki Masanja, 23, won a ROSATOM competition for young people to make videos about Africa’s nuclear potential, and got to visit the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant in western Russia in 2017. “It was mind-blowing,” said the second-year mechanical engineering student, via Skype. The experience left him with a strong sense that nuclear power should be adapted quickly for Africa’s needs. Sub-Saharan African nations have shown an interest in nuclear because coal is scarce, while large volumes of natural gas in Nigeria and Tanzania tend to be exported for profit, said Jessica Lovering, co-author of a 2018 report, “Atoms for Africa”, from the U.S.-based Center for Global Development. Booming populations and international pressure to curb greenhouse gas emissions also play a role, she added. Ethiopia, for instance, has pledged under the Paris Agreement on climate change to curb its already meager emissions by two-thirds from business-as-usual projections by 2030. The Paris accord, agreed in 2015 by about 195 nations, seeks to wean the global economy off fossil fuels in the second half of this century, limiting the rise in average temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Ramping up nuclear power may be a carbon-neutral option, but presents dilemmas such as the high cost of building a plant and setting up supporting infrastructure, including safe management of nuclear fuel, said Lovering. Yet gaining access to large amounts of cheap electricity from nuclear plants that run 24/7 could boost domestic manufacturing, as well as lighting up homes, she said. REBEL RISK Some political observers, however, are concerned about the prospect of nuclear reactors backed by Russia in some countries with rebel groups and weak government institutions. An Africa-based Western diplomat, who asked to remain anonymous, doubted Russia’s assurances it would collect nuclear waste from projects it helped establish. “You could end up with very unfortunate situations in parts of Africa ... if you have a decaying nuclear power plant overrun by rebels, with waste that’s not going away,” he said. Multiple requests for an interview with Russia’s ambassador in Ethiopia were declined. So-called dirty bombs can combine conventional explosives like dynamite with radioactive material such as nuclear waste. Noel Stott, a South Africa-based researcher with VERTIC, a non-profit that tracks the implementation of international treaties, highlighted an array of agreements in place to control the weaponization of nuclear technology. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which all African countries but South Sudan are party, mandates safeguards to secure nuclear material, for example. And 40 nations have joined the Treaty of Pelindaba that creates a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. HALF-BAKED? At family-run cookie factory Mo-Ya, which towers over surrounding homes in Addis Ababa, chief executive officer Sara Zemui said Ethiopia’s plans to grow and modernize its energy production would mean better-powered businesses - and more jobs. Frequent electricity cuts have long disrupted baking at the factory, spoiling batches of the cookies whose sugary scent perfumes Sunday mass at a nearby church. A few months ago, Mo-Ya forked out more than $100,000 to purchase equipment that, in a blackout, enables a seamless transition to generator power, Zemui said. Here, as in the nearly two-thirds of Ethiopia with access to an electricity connection, power cuts - and associated costs - are caused mainly by overloads on the ageing grid, said Tilahun Legesse, a director at the Ethiopian Electric Utility. In other parts of Africa, however, similar daily outages are due to insufficient power production, said Lovering. At Addis Ababa University, assistant professor Tilahun Tesfaye cannot wait for his country to reap the benefits of a nuclear reactor. “It’s long, long overdue,” he said. “The need is very high.” But the road will be a long one, he said, pointing to out-of-order machinery in his nuclear physics laboratory, the largest such facility in this country of 105 million people. It could take 20 years for Ethiopia to build a nuclear power plant, estimated Hong-Jun Ahn, a Korean electrical engineer who advises the Ethiopian government on its nuclear plans. Yonas Gebru, director of Addis Ababa-based advocacy group Forum for Environment, said green activists could prove another hurdle amid debate over whether nuclear power is “clean” energy. “It would be good, and it would be wise also ... to better capitalize on already started initiatives such as hydropower, wind energy (and) solar energy,” said Gebru.

WASHINGTON - When a crowd in Bambari, in the Central African Republic, accused Mahamat Nour Mamadou of belonging to a militia group tied to the country’s previous regime, the consequences were swift and harsh. Soldiers whisked Mamadou away to a nearby town hall, where he was questioned, and then to a base, where he was tortured for five days. Mamadou told the AFP news agency that soldiers choked him with a chain, slashed his back with a knife and sliced off one of his fingers. Evidence of the abuse he endured appeared in an internal United Nations report circulated last month. Government-sanctioned torture isn’t unusual in conflict-scarred countries where authoritarian regimes fear popular uprisings and armed rebels. What makes Mamadou’s case unique is the group he says tortured him: Russian soldiers. The U.N. is now investigating allegations of torture at the hands of Russians in the CAR based on Manadou’s account, AFP reported. Military ties Private military contractors from Russia have, in recent years, stepped into a pivotal role in central Africa, including in the CAR and neighboring Sudan. Working closely with local governments, PMCs are providing security, gathering intelligence and training local armies. In the CAR, they’re advising the president. In Sudan, they’re guarding gold, diamond and uranium mines. Moscow has downplayed the groups’ roles and insists that they act independently of the Kremlin’s wishes. But experts say the contractors have close ties to Russia’s military apparatus, and their presence helps Moscow achieve its strategic goals, from acquiring needed resources to competing with China and the United States, both of whom have permanent bases in Africa and more military might. Jonathan Hutson is a human rights advocate and strategic communications consultant in Washington. He told VOA that Russian PMCs do the Kremlin’s bidding. “They’re really pretending to be mercenaries while actually functioning as part of Russia’s military intelligence arm, the GRU,” Hutson said. ‘Geopolitical ambitions’ “It’s being done with the knowledge and the aid of Russian government bodies,” said David Isenberg, an independent analyst who has studied private security contractors since the 1980s and testified before Congress on the topic. “This is basically part and parcel of Russia’s greater geopolitical ambitions in Africa and elsewhere in the world,” he added. The Russian Ministry of Defense, for example, helps issue passports to contractors, Isenberg said. PMCs also use weapons supplied by the Russian government and, on occasion, fly Russian military planes to destinations in Africa, Isenberg added. He estimates that about 175 Russian PMCs are in the Central African Republic, and at least 300 are in Sudan. So far, the model has proved successful for Moscow. Just a few hundred people on the ground in central Africa have provided Russia with access to both resources and power. FILE - Russian President Vladimir Putin talks with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during their meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia, Nov. 23, 2017. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin flew Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to Sochi, in western Russia, to discuss strategic interests. Al-Bashir said he needed protection, and he promised minerals in return. Since then, Russian involvement in the country has only increased, even as Sudan convulses under growing civil unrest, prompting protests and a violent crackdown on the press. ‘A shady area’ Whether PMCs are legal hasn’t been settled. In Russia, Hutson said, “It is illegal for private military contractors to exist. However, the Wagner Group, which is present in Sudan, is actually sponsored by the Russian government. They fly on Russian military planes. When they’re wounded, they’re treated in Russian military hospitals.” “It’s a shady area,” Isenberg said. A United Nations convention against mercenaries barely took effect due to low numbers of signatories, he added, and enforcement has been spotty. In a legal gray zone, outside the kind of traditional approach to security that would be subject to more diplomatic scrutiny, Russia has helped suppress protests and gather intelligence, Hutson said. “It’s much more opaque, and therefore much more difficult to deal with,” Isenberg added. But even as unrest in Sudan and the Central African Republic continue, Russia’s bets appear well placed. With a modest investment, they’ve found strategic allies and access to resources. Now, they’re planning a base in Sudan, along the Red Sea.

Cameroon is sending more than 1,000 troops to the Central African Republic. (Photo: M. Kindzeka / VOA) YAOUNDE, CAMEROON - Cameroon is dispatching more than a thousand troops to help bring peace to its troubled neighbor, the Central African Republic. The troops are leaving as analysts say they are already stretched handling such internal crises as piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, the Boko Haram insurgency and the separatist crisis that has left at least 3,000 killed in three years. The Cameroon military band plays as the first contingent of over 300 peacekeeping troops leaves for the neighboring Central African Republic on September 4. Cameroon's defense minister, Joseph Beti Assomo, said they have been well trained to join the U.N. peacekeeping mission of more than 13,000 troops, police and civilians to restore peace to the Central African Republic while respecting the rights and dignity of the people they are protecting. ""Always determined to fulfill his regional and international commitment as concerns collective security, the head of state, commander in chief of the armed forces has provided the Central African Republic with multifaceted support in order to enable the country to get its institutions which have already been damaged back on the feet,"" he said.

Beti Assomo said Cameroon was deploying 1,300 troops and civilians who, by protecting the Central African Republic, will also be protecting Cameroon. Cameroon hosts about 250,000 CAR refugees, and rebels quite often cross over and hold Cameroonian farmers and cattle ranchers for ransom. They also hide across the porous border with Cameroon when challenged in the Central African Republic The crisis began in the troubled country in 2013, when a mainly Muslim rebel movement called the Seleka overthrew President Francois Bozize, a Christian. That move triggered the rise of a predominantly Christian militia called the Anti-Balaka. Thousands have been killed and a quarter of the population of 4.5 million have fled their homes. Counting on international help CAR Ambassador to Cameroon Marcial Beti Marace said his country has been counting on the international community to help it out of the crisis. He said the people and president of CAR are proud to know that they will have support to bring back badly needed peace and order to their country from well-trained Cameroonian peacekeepers. Donatien Tchega, a visiting lecturer at the University of Yaounde, said the decision to dispatch Cameroon troops to the neighboring state may seriously undermine efforts to secure its own territory and the Gulf of Guinea, where there are regular reports of pirate attacks. FILE - Houses destroyed during battles with Boko Haram are seen in Kousseri, Cameroon, June 11, 2019. He said it is not a good decision for Cameroon, which is already facing enormous challenges fighting Boko Haram terrorists on its northern border with Nigeria, containing the spillover of the crisis in CAR with sporadic rebel attacks on its territory, and especially stopping separatists from their fight to create an English-speaking state, to send over a thousand of its troops to a foreign country. He said the Cameroonian military is overstretched and this decision may also hamper its effort to fight piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, separatists in the English-speaking regions, and Boko Haram terrorists. Cameroon, however, said it must contribute to bring peace and order in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, of which the Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo are also members. Cameroon has over 24 million of the 54 million people in the economic bloc.

La France et la Russie rivalisent d’initiatives pour aider la Centrafrique à sortir de la crise qui la frappe depuis cinq ans. Mais, les intérêts des deux puissances semblent bien différents. La ministre française des Armées est arrivée ce lundi à Bangui. Comme pour s’accommoder de la tradition africaine qui veut qu’on apporte quelque présent à la personne qu’on visite, Florence Parly a remis 1 400 fusils d’assaut (kalachnikov de type AK-47 ) et trois embarcations amphibies aux forces armées centrafricaines (FACA). Si ce don procède des relations séculaires et excellentes existant entre la France et son ancienne colonie, d’autres puissances se montrent de plus en plus solidaires de la République centrafricaine (RCA) pour l’aider à sortir de la crise politico-militaire qui la cisaille depuis 2013. Parmi ces puissances, le géant russe. Exempté comme la France de l’embargo sur la livraison des armes à la RCA, le pays de Vladimir Poutine a livré en janvier dernier aux FACA, une cargaison de 1 700 armes de type Kalachnikov. Pour Florence Parly, « il est important que cette contribution positive qu’un certain nombre de pays, parmi lesquels la Russie, apportent, puisse s’inscrire dans l’initiative africaine de paix qui est soutenue par l’UA », a-t-elle déclaré ce mardi au cours d’un point de presse. La Russie a aussi formé 2 000 soldats et les a aidés à se déployer dans certaines localités reculées du nord, du centre ou du sud-est. Elle y a envoyé 170 instructeurs civils, qui ne sont autres que des mercenaires, étroitement liés à des sociétés minières russes, avoisinant aujourd’hui 300 à 400 hommes, selon des sources occidentales. « Contribution positive » Le volet culturel n’est pas mis de côté. En finançant le concours de beauté Miss Centrafrique 2018, la radio Lengo Songö et des journaux comme « La Feuille volante du président », la Russie est loin d’oublier que la culture peut adoucir les mœurs dans un pays en conflit. Il s’agit de « restaurer le charme d’antan de Bangui La coquette (surnom de la capitale centrafricaine) », selon un Banguissois. « C’est important le concours des miss, il y a de très belles filles dans le pays, et avant on ne les mettait pas en valeur », s’est réjouie dimanche, Vénus Claudie Perrière, sœur de Charlène Sombo, miss élue miss Centrafrique 2018. « La déclaration de Khartoum récemment signée est un gage de paix », déclarait pour sa part Léa Floride Mokodopo, organisatrice du concours. Initié par la Russie en août, le sommet de Khartoum est une médiation entre les groupes armés qui occupent les 2/3 du pays pour tenter de trouver une issue à la crise que connaît la Centrafrique depuis 2013. Un sommet un peu mal perçu par la France. « Il n’y a aucune alternative, ni souhaitable, ni susceptible de réussir en dehors de celle de l’UA », déclarait en septembre dernier, Jean Yves Le Drian, ministre français des Affaires étrangères, lors d’une visite à Bangui. S’il n’existe pour l’instant aucune relation de cause à effet, l’assassinat en fin juillet de trois journalistes russes en terre centrafricaine pourrait aussi s’inscrire dans ce contexte où tout porte à croire qu’il y a une sorte de concurrence entre la France et la Russie dans ce pays d’Afrique centrale. Un pays qui, à l’instar de bien d‘États au monde peut payer un lourd tribut à l’antagonisme entre grandes puissances de la planète. ",2018-11-12 00:00:00+00:00,2021-04-09 18:14:46.644405+00:00,EXTM

Mis à jour à 17h GMT “Un hélicoptère Mi-24 de la Minusca, avec son bord quatre membres de l’Aviation sénégalaise, a été victime d’un crash (…) lors d’une mission de soutien”, a indiqué vendredi la Minusca dans un communiqué. Le quatrième membre d‘équipage “est dans un état jugé critique”, selon l’ONU, et était en cours d‘évacuation à l’hôpital pour des soins intensifs. “Selon les premièrs éléments, cet accident est dû à de mauvaises conditions atmosphériques ayant rendu impossible l’atterrissage”, ajoute le communiqué. Le crash de cet hélicoptère d’attaque de construction russe a été confirmé par l’armée sénégalaise dans un communiqué publié vendredi après-midi. “L‘état-major général des armées est en contact permanent avec les autorités de l’ONU en vue de l‘évacuation du blessé et du rapatriement des dépouilles”, a indiqué le ministère des forces armées. La Minusca a mené jeudi une attaque contre le groupe armé centrafricain Retour réclamation réhabilitation (3R) à Koui, dans le nord-ouest du pays, ont confirmé à l’AFP plusieurs responsables de la Minusca sous couvert de l’anonymat. Jeudi soir, le mouvement rebelle avait affirmé qu’une de ses bases avait été bombardée par des casques bleus. 3R fait partie des 14 groupes armés signataires le 6 février d’un accord de paix avec le gouvernement centrafricain, qui a pour ambition de mettre fin aux conflits qui déchirent le pays depuis 2013. Mercredi, le porte-parole de la Minusca, Vladimir Monteiro, avait appelé le leader des 3R, Sidiki Abass, “à livrer les auteurs des massacres commis en mai dernier dans la région de Paoua”. Violences sans répit Quarante-six civils avaient été tués par des éléments des 3R dans cette région du nord du pays. A ce jour, seuls trois auteurs présumés ont été livrés aux autorités. Le 4 septembre, Sidiki Abass, également connu sous le nom de Sidi Bi Soulemane, avait annoncé sa démission de son poste de conseiller militaire auprès du gouvernement centrafricain, qu’il occupait dans le cadre de l’accord de paix. Sidi Bi Soulemane avait intégré le gouvernement le 6 mars, en même temps que d’autres représentants des 14 groupes armés signataires de l’accord de Khartoum. Malgré une relative accalmie depuis la signature de cet accord de paix, les violences contre les civils et entre groupes armés se poursuivent en Centrafrique. Le 14 septembre, deux groupes armés signataires de l’accord se sont affrontés à Birao, dans l’extrême nord-est du pays. Quelque 13.000 personnes ont été déplacées par ces combats, qui ont causé la mort de 23 miliciens. Riche en ressources naturelles, la Centrafrique est déchirée depuis 2013 par une guerre qui a forcé près d’un quart de ses 4,7 millions d’habitants à fuir leur domicile.

Parmi de nombreux projets pour le développement du business et des relations étroites économiques, l’un des secteurs les plus importants à investir est l’énergétique, plus précisément, l’électrification du continent. D’après les statistiques officielles, une moitié de la population africaine n’a pas toujours d’accès à l’électricité. Les infrastructures existants comme les panneaux solaires et stations hydrauliques ne sont pas en mesure de fournir ce bien au moins à une bonne majorité des Africains. Il est pourtant évident que le développement du potentiel des pays du continent, riches en ressources naturelles, nécessite beaucoup plus d’énergies, surtout lorsqu’il s’agit des économies émergentes. Actuellement, il n’y a qu’une seule centrale nucléaire sur le continent africain. C’est la centrale nucléaire de Koeberg d’une capacité De 1 GW située près de la ville du Cap en Afrique du Sud. Elle a été construite dans les années 1960 dans le cadre d’un projet français et est maintenant la principale source énergétique dans la province du Cap-occidental. Quant à la Centrafrique, il n’y a que 2 stations fournissant l’électricité. Il s’agit de Boali 1 et Boali 2. En outre, il existe plusieurs stations solaires. Mais, pour être franc, ces capacités sont insuffisantes pour couvrir tout le territoire de la république afin que la totalité de la population puisse accéder à l’électricité. Dans ce cas, l’énergie nucléaire peut être la meilleure solution car elle est écologique, sûre et bon marché pour la production de l’électricité. Elle est en mesure de répondre aux besoins des régions à forte intensité et assurer une croissance significative commerciale et industrielle. Par ailleurs, le partenariat éventuel et les contrats qui vont succéder avec un géant énergétique russe, Rosatom, pourrait liquider totalement le problème du manque énergétique sur le continent. Le sommet de Sotchi pourrait donc devenir une plateforme prometteuse pour des coopérations africano-russes. @Herman THEMONA, ",2019-10-04 00:00:00+00:00,2021-04-09 18:17:39.526586+00:00,EXTM

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu and his CAR counterpart Marie-Noelle Koyara signed the document on the sidelines of Army-2018 defense expo outside Moscow. The deal “will help strengthen ties in the defense sphere,” Shoigu was quoted as saying after the ceremony. The agreement is set to deepen Moscow’s involvement in the impoverished Central African Republic, where the government is desperate to boost its armed forces in the fight against militias which control most of the country. There were no immediate details, but Interfax reported that the accord would see Russia help with training for the Central African Republic Armed Forces (FACa). Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Alexander Fomin said that the agreement will allow FACa personnel to study at Russian Defense Ministry universities, Interfax reported. Fomin told Interfax that the pact was a “framework agreement” about general avenues of cooperation, including: “Exchange of delegations, education in Russian military institutes, mutual visits and so forth,” AFP reported. Later on Tuesday, RJDH reported that, according to a document seen by RJDH, Central African Republic armed groups had expressed willingness to return to talks with the government under the auspices of the African Union. The groups issued 89 demands, 12 of which are “non-negotiable,” and the “non-negotiable” demands include “the revision or cancellation of military cooperation agreements with Russia and South Africa.” Russian advisors already work with the CAR’s military and provide security and advice for President Faustin-Archange Touadera. A United Nations arms embargo imposed in 2013 was last year lifted by the Security Council to allow delivery of Russian weapons for CAR’s armed forces. The U.N. Security Council in January unanimously extended its sanctions against CAR until January 31, 2019. France, Belgium, China and the United States have also recently supplied equipment for CAR’s military . In July, the European Union extended its military training mission in the Central African Republic until 2020 , pledging €25 million ($29 million) to help reform the country’s defense sector. The scope of the mission, known as the EUTM RCA, has also been modified to give strategic advice to the president’s cabinet, interior ministry and police, as well as the military. in June, the E.U.’s diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini proposed a new €10.5 billion ($12.4 billion) “peace facility” that could pay for military equipment , including lethal weaponry, for partner countries in crisis zones such as the Central African Republic and Africa’s Sahel region. In April, President Faustin Archange Touadera said he wants to “accelerate” the disarmament of members of armed groups in Central African Republic, calling for more peacekeepers to be deployed, and for the U.N.’s Minusca mission to transition from peacekeeping to peace enforcement . Russian journalists murdered The military cooperation agreement follows the murder in late July of three Russian journalists who were ambushed in Central African Republic while investigating Wagner, a shadowy Russian private military contractor group, and its possible relation to both government and rebel forces. The investigation was funded by ex-oil tycoon Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Both CAR authorities and Moscow have labeled the killings a robbery, but Khodorkovsky claimed this argument “does not stand up to scrutiny”. More: Does the murder of 3 journalists in Central African Republic expose Russia’s ‘raid, seize and exploit’ strategy? A poor country beset by violence One of Africa’s poorest countries, the CAR descended into violence in 2013 following the ousting of the majority-Christian country’s president, Francois Bozize, by a coalition of Muslim-majority rebel groups called the Seleka. Within months, Seleka was officially disbanded, but many fighters refused to disarm, becoming known as ex-Seleka. Many others joined the mainly Christian anti-balaka militia to fight the Seleka, leading to a spiral of violence between groups along both religious and ethnic lines in which thousands died. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned – anti-Balaka in the southwest and ex-Seleka in the northeast. France intervened militarily to help force out the Seleka before handing on to the U.N. peacekeeping mission, Minusca . President Touadera’s weak government controls around a fifth of the country and relies heavily on Minusca for support. The rest is controlled by at least 14 different militia groups who often fight each other for control of revenue from extortion, roadblocks or mineral resources. Violence has led to thousands of deaths. Nearly 700,000 people are displaced, 570,000 are refugees abroad and 2.5 million are in need of humanitarian aid, according to the United Nations.

Congo borders Central African Republic (CAR), where Moscow has a U.N.-approved mission, and will become one of the few African countries with an officially confirmed presence of Russian military personnel on the ground. In recent years Moscow has pushed for influence on the continent - where China has a major economic presence - by signing military cooperation deals with around 20 African countries. Peskov, in a conference call with reporters, disregarded questions on how many military specialists Russia will send to Congo Republic and whether they are regular soldiers or private contractors working for the Russian government. He said they are expected to service military hardware and munitions that had been supplied earlier. “Much of this hardware can be still used if there is proper maintenance and these people, who are sent there, will service the munitions,” Peskov said. The military deal was signed on Thursday after talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Congolese counterpart Denis Sassou Nguesso in the Kremlin. Russia has donated hundreds of weapons and sent more than 200 trainers to Central African Republic earlier this year to bolster the government’s fight against militia groups after receiving an exemption from a United Nations arms embargo. Reuters reported earlier that Russian troops and contractors were on assignments in Egypt, Libya and Sudan, though only in the case of Sudan did Russian officials acknowledge the Russian presence.

Russian advisors work with the CAR’s military and provide security and advice to Touadera. Speaking at the ceremony, Touadera said that the deployment of the newly trained soldiers will be carried out jointly with the United Nations mission Minusca because they set the same strategy, the CAR Presidency said in a Facebook post . Touadera said that the Russian instructors teach soldiers how to use Russian weapons, after training provided by the European Union Training Mission in Central African Republic. He said that CAR “is still under embargo, and the lifting of the embargo begins with the EUTM training.” “Those who have been trained must undergo weapons training so that we have the opportunity to deploy them on the ground,” he said. FACa personnel are “requested everywhere by the population, so gradually, we will deploy them, but in conjunction with Minusca,” he said. “We have already established a deployment plan with Minusca.” “I am very happy that they will contribute to the protection of the population, help Minusca to fulfill its mission and help restore peace in our country,” Touadera said.

Image: Renaissance.cf/Facebook Russian ambassador Lebanov says new arms shipment being prepared Speaking at the ceremony on Monday, Russia’s Ambassador to CAR Sergey Lebanov said that the training program reflects Russia’s aim to help the CAR reform its defense and internal security forces. Lebanov noted that the recent signing of a defense agreement between Russia and CAR offered the possibility for Central African officers and NCOs to be trained in Russian military schools. He said that the relationship between Russia and CAR should not be limited to military cooperation, and the two states should also strengthen economic, humanitarian and political dialogue. Lebanov said that a second shipment of Russian arms and ammunition “is in preparation,” and will be delivered once it has been approved by the U.N. Security Council. A U.N. arms embargo imposed in 2013 was last year lifted by the Security Council to allow delivery of Russian weapons for CAR’s armed forces. The U.N. Security Council in January unanimously extended its sanctions against CAR until January 31, 2019. France, Belgium, China and the United States have also recently supplied equipment for CAR’s military . In July, the European Union extended its military training mission in the Central African Republic until 2020 , pledging €25 million ($29 million) to help reform the country’s defense sector. The scope of the EUTM RCA mission has also been modified to give strategic advice to the president’s cabinet, interior ministry and police, as well as the military. in June, the E.U.’s diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini proposed a new €10.5 billion ($12.4 billion) “peace facility” that could pay for military equipment , including lethal weaponry, for partner countries in crisis zones such as the Central African Republic and Africa’s Sahel region.

Image: Renaissance.cf/Facebook A country divided Despite reserves of diamonds, gold, uranium, copper and iron, Central African Republic is one of the world’s poorest countries. The majority-Christian country descended into violence following the 2013 ousting of President Francois Bozize in 2013 by the Seleka, a coalition of mainly Muslim rebel groups. Seleka was officially disbanded within months, but many fighters refused to disarm, becoming known as ex-Seleka. Many others joined the mainly Christian anti-Balaka militia to fight the Seleka, leading to a spiral of violence between groups along both religious and ethnic lines. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned – anti-Balaka in the southwest and ex-Seleka in the northeast. Violence by both sides led to thousands of deaths. Nearly 700,000 people are displaced, 570,000 have fled the country and 2.5 million are in need of humanitarian aid, according to the U.N. Touadera’s weak government controls around a fifth of the country and relies heavily on the United Nations peacekeeping mission, Minusca , for support. The rest is controlled by at least 14 different militia groups who often fight each other for control of revenue from extortion, roadblocks or mineral resources. In April, Touadera said he wants to “accelerate” the disarmament of members of armed groups in Central African Republic, calling for more peacekeepers to be deployed, and for the U.N.’s Minusca mission to transition from peacekeeping to peace enforcement .

Since then, however, a deepening mystery over the nature of the cargo and the identity of those on board has left the Congolese government facing awkward questions. The fate of the stricken plane, a mysterious Antonov-72 so far only identified by its former registration number, EK-72903, may also provide a glimpse into the murkier side of Russia’s attempts to reassert its influence in Africa. The details remain scant. Last Thursday, the plane crashed 59 minutes after taking off from the eastern city of Goma bound for the capital Kinshasa. None of the eight people on board survived, officials said. The passengers were identified as the personal chauffeur of Felix Tshisekedi, Congo’s president, and three of his bodyguards. An armoured vehicle used by the president was also on board. A more troubling disclosure followed when two of the four-strong crew were identified. Vitaly Shumkov and Vladimir Sadovnichy, the plane’s pilots, were not only Russian nationals, they both appeared to have a background in gun running. The plane, too, has a murky past. EK-72903 was once owned by an Armenian company whose proprietor has been linked to arms smuggling elsewhere in Africa. Whether the crew were somehow furthering Kremlin interests remains unknown. However, there is no secret that Russia hopes to regain the influence the Soviet Union once wielded in Africa by wooing its leaders with arms sales, private security and “political technologists” adept at winning elections. Such attempts have often been linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin who has been accused of masterminding attempts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Mr Prigozhin allegedly had Congo in his sights after Russia announced in May that it was sending a team of army specialists to the country. Some Russia media outlets speculated that Mr Prigozhin, was on board the plane ahead of a meeting with President Tshisekedi. That is almost certainly untrue. Slumming it on an Antonov is generally not Mr Progozhin’s style. “He wouldn’t get into a plane like that,” a Congolese government official said. “This gentleman is an oligarch and if he travels then he travels on his own plane.” The official said that while Mr Prigozhin had not been scheduled to meet President Tshisekedi, other Russian government representatives had requested a meeting to discuss the upcoming summit. It is unclear if any were on board. At least two people described as being “of eastern European origin” were also on the plane. They have not yet been identified, adding to the intrigue surrounding the flight. For the moment, whoever else was on board the plane remains unknown. With some sources saying there may have been 11 people rather than eight on board, UN officials were attempting to identify the remains of the dead — some of whom had been hastily buried — last night.

(Photo by Behrouz MEHRI / AFP) (Photo by BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP via Getty Images) Now playing Why researcher is concerned about Japan's cherry bloom (CNN) — When anti-government protests erupted in Sudan at the end of last year , the response of President Omar al-Bashir came straight from the dictators’ playbook – a crackdown that led to scores of civilian deaths. At the same time, a more insidious strategy was being developed – one that involved spreading misinformation on social media, blaming Israel for fomenting the unrest, and even carrying out public executions to make an example of “looters.” The author of this strategy was not the Sudanese government. According to documents seen by CNN, it was drawn up by a Russian company tied to an oligarch favored by the Kremlin: Yevgeny Prigozhin. Multiple government and military sources in Khartoum have confirmed to CNN that Bashir’s government received the proposals and began to act on them, before Bashir was deposed in a coup earlier this month. One official of the former regime said Russian advisers monitored the protests and began devising a plan to counter them with what he called “minimal but acceptable loss of life.” While the documents do not come from official Russian agencies, they were essentially a blueprint for protecting the Kremlin’s interests in Sudan and keeping Bashir in power. The documents seen by CNN, which include letters and internal company communications, are among several thousand obtained and investigated by the London-based Dossier Center, run by exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The Dossier Center receives data, documents and other information from a variety of sources, often anonymous, and shares them with journalists. Khodorkovsky ran afoul of President Vladimir Putin after alleging widespread corruption in Russia and spent several years in prison for alleged tax fraud – which he has always denied. CNN has assessed the documents to be credible. They are also consistent with the accounts of witnesses who say Russian observers were seen at the recent protests in Sudan. -/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Police fired tear gas at protesters demonstrators in Khartoum in December. Sudan has been Moscow’s template for expanding its influence in Africa and around the globe: A hybrid of private and state interests that rewards both oligarchs and the Kremlin. It’s a low-cost strategy that gives Moscow a foothold in strategic places, without the commitment of regular forces or major investment by the Russian government. Instead it uses companies that supply private contractors in return for commercial concessions. Indeed, the documents seen by CNN originate from a St. Petersburg-based company, M-Invest, which has an office in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. M-Invest lists as its core business the “extraction of ores and sands of precious metals.” As CNN has previously reported, the company was granted concessions for a gold mine in Sudan. But its activities seem to have gone far beyond mining. What the Dossier Center’s documents show President Bashir cultivated a close relationship with the Kremlin, visiting Moscow in 2017. Russia supplied modern Su-35 fighter jets in the same year. Put simply, Russia had placed a big bet on Bashir. As protests against the regime gathered steam, that bet was at risk. According to the documents reviewed by CNN, M-Invest drew up a plan to discredit and suppress those protests. One document from early January, reviewed by CNN, proposes spreading claims that protesters were attacking mosques and hospitals. It also suggested creating an image of demonstrators as “enemies of Islam and traditional values” by planting LGBT flags among them. And it proposed a social media campaign claiming that “Israel supports the protesters.” CNN An extract from the documents details a plan to spread disinformation. The strategy also suggested the government “simulate a dialogue with the opposition and demonstrate the openness of the government” in order to “isolate leaders of the protest and gain time.” M-Invest proposed ways to make the government look good – through widely publicized “free distribution of bread, flour, grain, food.” But most of its focus was on the protests. It recommended fabricating evidence “of arson by protesters against mosques, hospitals and nurseries, [and] stealing grain from the public store.” It also suggested blaming the West for the protests and using “extensive media coverage of the interrogation of detainees, where they admit they arrived to organize civil war in Sudan.” And it even proposed “public executions of looters and other spectacular events to distract the protest-minded audience.” CNN made multiple efforts to reach M-Invest. Its phone number in St. Petersburg did not work. An Arabic speaker answered a call to its office in Khartoum but hung up. CNN visited the address but was told the space was leased to a Russian company called Mir Gold. Another company document recommends the arrest of protest leaders the day before demonstrations are due to take place – and spreading disinformation by saying that protesters were being paid to take part. Also recommended: Show how “security forces detained a car with weapons, foreign currency, propaganda materials operated by foreign citizens.” MOHAMED NURELDIN ABDALLAH/REUTERS Protests erupted in Sudan last December. M-Invest also proposed building social media teams to attack the protest movement, “starting disputes with users and voicing alternative agenda…The optimal number of accounts working in parallel – 40-50.” In some ways the playbook is similar to that deployed by the Internet Research Agency, accused by US authorities of trying to disrupt the 2016 US election campaign. Prigozhin – kown as “Putin’s chef” for the catering contracts he held with the Kremlin – was one of 13 Russians charged as part of the investigation into Russian election interference by US special counsel Robert Mueller. The US alleges that fictitious social media sites were set up to polarize voters with inflammatory and, in some cases, fake information. Prigozhin has denied any involvement in election meddling, and has denied any connection to the Internet Research Agency. Calls to his main company, Concord Management and Consulting, went unanswered. The documents reviewed by CNN do not indicate that official Russian security agencies were directly involved in trying to suppress the protests in Sudan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova said at a press briefing in January: “We are informed that some employees of Russian private security firms, who have no relation to the Russian government authorities, are indeed working in Sudan. But their functions are limited to personnel training.” Time starts to run out Sources in Khartoum have told CNN that Bashir’s government did try to begin implementing some of M-Invest’s plans. For example, it began detaining students from the Darfur region and accused them of trying to foment civil war – one of the ploys recommended by M-Invest. The sources say Russian advisers from a private company were placed in several ministries and the National Intelligence Service. But it was too little, too late. In a letter to Bashir, drafted on March 17, Prigozhin complained that the Sudanese government’s “inaction” had “provoked the intensification of the crisis.” And he added, with unknowing prescience: “The lack of active steps by the new government to overcome the crisis is likely to lead to even more serious political consequences.” CNN One letter expressed concern that the plan had not been implemented. Another letter from Prigozhin, dated April 6, praised the longtime Sudanese ruler as a “wise and far-sighted leader” but urged immediate economic reforms to solve the crisis. Five days later, Bashir was deposed . The military dimension Sudan, a resource-rich nation which has borders with seven other countries, has been shunned by the West. Its Red Sea coast was of particular interest to Moscow, because of recent moves by the United States and China to establish a military presence in the region. Moscow has been eyeing the development of a naval base at Port Sudan. Again, M-Invest was involved. In June 2018, it drafted a letter on behalf of Sudan’s Military Industrial Corporation to push closer military links. It mentions a visit the previous month by the deputy commander of the Russian navy, Lt. Gen. Oleg Makarevich, which had discussed “the possibility of creating on the territory of the Republic of Sudan point of logistics ships of The Russian Navy.” CNN M-Invest documents indicate the importance to Russia of a port in Sudan. The letter is addressed to Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian armed forces. Gerasimov is credited with promoting the use of alternative measures to military force – including political and economic levers as well as influencing public opinion through social media – to destabilize adversaries. Yevgeny Prigozhin has been a pioneer and partner in Russia’s hybrid strategy. Not only was the Internet Research Agency connected to his company Concord Management; he was also linked to a company, Evro Polis, which secured oil exploration rights in Syria. At the time, fighters of a company called Wagner, a private military contractor were also operating in Syria. As CNN has previously reported , Wagner is led by Dmitry Utkin, who is under US sanctions for assisting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Utkin has long been close to Prigozhin’s inner circle Prigozhin’s sprawling business empire is difficult to unravel. But the mining concession on behalf of M-Invest in Sudan was signed by a director named Mikhail Potepkin. A man of the same name also co-owned a company called IT-Debugger with Anna Bogacheva, one of those named in Mueller’s indictment of 13 Russians as working for the Internet Research Agency. Mikhail Metzel/TASS/Mikhail Metzel/TASS Concord Catering General Director Yevgeny Prigozhin seen after the sixth meeting of the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council Potepkin also identifies himself as a project manager for another company, Megaline, which is 50% owned by Prigozhin’s holding company Concord, according to company records. In a note on Megaline’s letterhead to Sudan’s minerals ministry in 2017, he says that M-Invest “will enjoy all the necessary support of the Megaline Group.” CNN was unable to contact Potepkin. M-Invest also signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry, seen by CNN, for the use of transport aircraft of the 223rd Flight. Between August 2018 and February 2019, two aircraft of the 223rd Flight made at least nine flights to Khartoum. One of those planes took Bashir on his controversial visit to Syria last December, the first by an Arab leader since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Russia has also reinforced its presence in the neighboring Central African Republic, sending convoys of supplies across the border. Whether Sudan will remain central to Russian ambitions in Africa depends on the unfolding situation in Khartoum. Moscow will not give up easily. It has strong links with the Sudanese military, which is now in the driving seat – even if Bashir, the man described by Prigozhin as a “wise and balanced politician,” is now in a high-security prison.

The company said on Wednesday it had suspended three networks of “inauthentic” Russian accounts. The Facebook pages targeted eight countries across the continent: Madagascar, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya. Read more All were linked to Prigozhin, a Russian tycoon close to Vladimir Putin. The US has previously indicted Prigozhin for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. It accuses him of running a global disinformation media empire and of funding the Internet Research Agency , the St Petersburg troll factory that boosted Donald Trump. Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said Russia used almost 200 fake and compromised accounts to reach more than 1 million followers in Africa. Russian-run networks worked closely with locals in order to disguise the sites’ true origins, he said. “There’s sort of a joining of forces, if you will, between local actors and actors from Russia ,” he told Reuters. “It appears that the local actors who are involved know who is behind the operation.” In recent years the Kremlin has made considerable efforts to cultivate support from African rulers. Last week Putin held the first-ever Russia-Africa forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, attended by more than 40 African heads of state. Prigozhin has led Russia’s push in Africa. Mercenaries from Wagner – a shadowy private military contractor linked to Prigozhin – have been sent to the Central African Republic . Prigozhin entities have also established media outlets in several African countries and have sent Russian “advisers” to help with elections. Moscow’s aim appears to be to bolster existing governments and smear pro-western opposition parties. Documents seen by the Guardian earlier this year envisage grooming a new generation of African “leaders” and undercover “agents”, and pushing out former colonial powers such as France or the UK. Facebook said one fake network was centred on Sudan, where in late 2018 Russia tried unsuccessfully to prop up President Omar al-Bashir, who was deposed in April . Another – featuring 35 accounts and 53 pages – was run out of Madagascar and Mozambique. A third was focused on Libya. The campaigns shut down for meddling in Africa had posted about local news and geopolitical issues, as well as sharing content from local and Russian state media including Sputnik and RT. Some of the accounts were active as far back as 2014, Facebook said. The company did not identify which accounts had been suspended. The Guardian found that the Facebook page of a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama , based in Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, was no longer working. Also not working was the account for Afric, a South Africa-based website previously linked with a Russian attempt to meddle in the country’s recent election by backing the ruling African National Congress. The campaign appears to have had little impact. Researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the research lab at Stanford University, said the networks used a variety of techniques across the African countries. Some accounts supported a specific party or candidate, they said, while others backed multiple figures. In other cases, the pages appeared geared towards building support for Wagner activities or Russian deals for gold, diamonds and other natural resources. The takedown on Wednesday was Facebook’s second move against groups it linked to Prigozhin in a week. Last week the company said it had suspended a network of 50 Instagram accounts connected with the Internet Research Agency Prigozhin has denied US claims he finances the troll factory and says Wagner does not exist.

While in Russia, Touadéra asked Putin for increased military assistance and even floated the idea of hosting a Russian military base. Russian investigative outlet Proekt previously reported that Prigozhin became interested in soft-power projects in Africa in early 2018. According to Proekt, his St Petersburg office had prepared for him an extensive research of 20 African countries and laid out possible pathways for creating a network of loyal political strategies on the continent. However, Proekt described the efforts as of mixed success, with political strategists lacking necessary education and Prigohzin-backed candidates not securing the desired seats during local elections.

In 2002, he served caviar and truffles to President George W. Bush during a summit in St. Petersburg. Before that, he renovated a boat that became the city’s most exclusive restaurant. But his business empire has expanded far beyond the kitchen. US investigators believe it was Prigozhin’s company that financed a Russian “troll factory” that used social media to spread fake news during the 2016 US presidential campaign, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation.

Prigozhin was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in December of 2016 for providing financial support for Russia’s military occupation of Ukraine. Two of his companies, including his catering business, were also sanctioned by Treasury this year. CNN has examined scores of documents leaked from Prigozhin’s companies that show further evidence of his links to the troll factory.

The contract was for 20 million rubles (then $650,000) for construction work at the IRA and was signed by the director general of IRA. Additionally, company records reviewed by CNN show that an employee at Concord Consulting subsequently joined IRA. Several emails and calls from CNN to Concord Consulting went unanswered.

Last year, he filed 15 lawsuits against the Internet company Yandex, using a Russian law that obliges online search engines to remove “illegal, inaccurate, or irrelevant information.” The case was subsequently dropped. The Internet Research Agency has long been in the crosshairs of US investigations. A declassified assessment by the US intelligence community published in January concluded that the “likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence,” though it did not name Prigozhin. Prigozhin has a colorful past. He spent nine years in prison in the 1980s for fraud and robbery, according to Russian media reports. After his release, he went into the catering business – renovating a boat and opening New Island, one of a half-dozen upscale restaurants he owns in St. Petersburg. Putin turned to him to cater his birthday parties as well as dinners with visiting leaders, including President Bush and Jacques Chirac of France. A headline in The Moscow Times referred to Prigozhin as Putin’s “Personal Chef.” Prigozhin subsequently won lucrative catering contracts for schools and Russia’s armed forces. He escorted Putin around his new food-processing factory in 2010. By then he was very much a Kremlin insider with a growing commercial empire. Origins of IRA The Internet Research Agency was based at 55 Savushkina Street in St. Petersburg before it officially ceased operations on December 28, 2016. But investigative journalist Andrei Zakharov, who works for the business media group RBC, says its work continues. “They have a lot of legal entities,” Zakharov says, “and they still, I think, change it every year or every two years.” Company registrations retrieved by CNN appear to confirm that. Another company at 55 Savushkina Street is Glavset, whose director general has the same name as the boss of IRA. The name matches that of a former regional police chief in St. Petersburg. CNN has also tried to reach Glavset’s management without success.

Photograph: Peter Kovalev/Tass Scepticism and safety concerns persist before vessel begins 4,000-mile Arctic journey by Andrew Roth in Murmansk Sun 4 Aug 2019 08.00 EDT Last modified on Sun 4 Aug 2019 15.25 EDT “I feel like I’m one of the first cosmonauts going into space,” said Vladimir Irminku, one of the chief engineers of the Akademik Lomonosov, as he stood on the deck of the giant, box-like platform on a chilly summer morning at Kola Bay in the Barents Sea. Russia is planning to dispatch the vessel, its first floating nuclear power station, on a 4,000-mile journey along the Northern Sea Route, in a milestone for the country’s growing use of nuclear power in its plans for Arctic expansion. If all goes to plan, the Akademik Lomonosov will be towed to the Arctic port of Pevek this month, where it will use its twin nuclear reactors to provide heat and energy to homes and support mining and drilling operations in Russia’s mineral-rich Chukotka region . Russia claims the project will provide clean energy to the remote region and allow authorities to retire an ageing nuclear plant and a coal-burning power station. But the Akademik Lomonosov has raised safety concerns among environmental groups, including accusations from Greenpeace that it could be a “floating Chernobyl”, and doubts about whether floating nuclear power stations meant to provide power to remote regions are economically viable. The Northern Sea Route – shipping lanes opened by melting ice sheets in the Arctic – presents new trade routes between China and Europe that Russia hopes to make navigable year-round. Northern Sea route – map The prospect of lucrative trade routes, as well as the region’s military importance, has led to a proliferation of nuclear-powered icebreakers, submarines and other high-tech nuclear technologies in the Arctic region. Thomas Nilsen, the editor of the Barents Observer newspaper, based in the Norwegian town of Kirkenes, has estimated that by 2035, the Russian Arctic “will by far be the most nuclearised waters on the planet”. Floating nuclear power stations may play a role. While plans have existed for generations and the US deployed a small nuclear reactor onboard a barge in the Panama Canal Zone in the 1960s and 70s, they have never been mass-produced. Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy company, hopes to change that and sell customised floating nuclear power stations to countries around the world. Rosatom said it has signed a project development agreement to explore the possibility of building a floating nuclear power plant for Sudan, among others. In Rosatom’s business plan, the Akademik Lomonosov is part of the sales pitch. The platform, recently painted a brilliant white and stamped with the energy agency’s logo, is an expensive pilot project with some extravagant flourishes, including a gym, pool and bar (with no alcohol) for crew members. Security is tight and visiting reporters were shadowed by private security guards while onboard. The Akademik Lomonosov, which took more than a decade to build, carries two KLT-40S nuclear reactors, similar to those used on Russia’s nuclear icebreakers. The reactors use low-enriched uranium and are capable of producing a combined 70MW of electricity, which Rosatom estimates as enough for 100,000 homes. Rosatom also claims the platform is “virtually unsinkable” and able to withstand collisions with icebergs and the impact of a seven-metre wave. Greenpeace has described the project as a “nuclear Titanic” and “Chernobyl on ice”, at a time when popular attention to the threat of nuclear accidents has been stoked by the popular HBO miniseries Chernobyl , dramatising the nuclear disaster of 1986 . Neighbouring countries including Norway have successfully lobbied Rosatom not to load nuclear fuel on to the platform until after it is towed away from their borders. Rosatom officials visibly bristled at the comparisons to previous nuclear accidents, arguing Chernobyl used far larger reactors of a different type and the nuclear technology onboard the Akademik Lomonosov had already been employed on Russia’s fleet of nuclear icebreakers.

But they’re going overboard. If they say there is a possibility of an accident with the reactor then they have to present evidence.” In case of an accident and a reactor shutdown, Irminku said, the ice-cold water beneath the reactor could be used as coolant until help arrived. The Bellona Foundation, which covers environmental issues in the Arctic region, theorised in a 2011 report that waves from a tsunami could throw the nuclear power plant away from its water source on shore, leading to a “nuclear accident with grave consequences”. Rosatom says dangers from waves are mitigated by a dock constructed around the power station, and if thrown inland, the reactors’ emergency systems can cool them without an electricity supply for 24 hours. Dmitry Alekseyenko, a deputy head of construction and operation of the platform, said: “We studied the experience of Fukushima closely. [What happens] if the platform is hit by a tsunami? Or thrown onshore? According to our tests, a tsunami caused by a nine-point [earthquake] will not dislocate it from its base.” Anna Kireeva of Bellona said the organisation had closely followed the development of the Akademik Lomonosov. Russian experts may safely be able to operate a floating nuclear power plant, she said, but plans to license out the technology raised much larger concerns. The Akademik Lomonosov is towed out of St Petersburg bound for Murmansk in April 2018. Photograph: Nicolai Gontar/Greenpeace/Reuters “Our real concern is the reason why they’re making this floating plant – they want to sell this technology to countries like Sudan,” she said in a telephone interview. “I’m really concerned that such nuclear technologies can be used in countries where levels of nuclear radiation safety, regulation and standards of safety are not on such a high level as in Russia. What will they do with spent nuclear fuel? How will they react in case of emergencies?” The other question is whether floating power plants are economically viable. While Rosatom executives have touted interest in the platforms, potential buyers have yet to put any money on the table. Some critics have called the project frivolous. Nilsen described it as a “PR project”, citing the lack of additional orders and the ready availability of liquefied natural gas in the Arctic region as an alternative to nuclear power. “If this had been a very good way of providing electricity to the north coast of Siberia then we would have seen more of them under construction … I think this is going to be a one-of-a-kind project,” he said. Rosatom officials declined to say how much the Akademik Lomonosov cost, although they did say they expected prices to fall as further plants were built. In 2016, an official connected to the project said the floating nuclear power station cost an estimated 21.5bn roubles (£274m), and the necessary infrastructure would cost an additional 7bn roubles. After years of reported cost overruns and delays, Alekseyenko called the plant’s completion a “milestone” for Rosatom and Russia’s shipbuilding industry. “An order this big hasn’t been completed for a long time,” he said.

Russian-backed separatist rebels and Ukrainian troops have been clashing in the east of the country. Russia has also been building up troops on the border with Ukraine. The official, Dmitry Kozak, said that Russian forces could intervene to ""defend"" Russian citizens. ""Everything depends on the scale of the conflagration,"" he said. He is deputy head of Russia's presidential administration. He also warned that an escalation could mark the ""beginning of the end"" for Ukraine - ""not a shot in the leg, but in the face"". The Ukrainian military says one of its soldiers was killed on Thursday by shooting from the separatists. The rebels used machine-guns, grenades and mortars several times and Ukrainian forces fired back, the military was quoted as saying. The Ukrainian army commander, Gen Ruslan Khomchak, said ""we see the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine's state border. ""However, this does not mean that our country is being encircled. The situation is under control."" Earlier the rebels said one of their fighters was killed when Ukrainian troops fired mortars at a village on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk. The United States and Germany have both expressed concern at the increase in tensions. Why are Ukraine-Russia tensions rising? Russia has been increasing the number of troops at the Ukrainian border, but at the same time maintains that they should not be seen as a threat. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Russian troop numbers there were the highest since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began. She described the situation as ""deeply concerning"". Russia has not detailed troop numbers, but the Ukrainian military asserted at the end of March that some 20,000 Russian troops had been moved towards Ukraine's border. Video has emerged on social media of Russian trains moving heavy weaponry, apparently towards the region. For months there have been sporadic clashes between Ukrainian troops and the Moscow-backed rebels in the Donbas region, violating a fragile ceasefire daily. Eastern Ukraine peace deal explained Ukraine says 25 of its troops have been killed in the conflict zone so far this year, and 50 died in the whole of last year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the region on Thursday to see ""the locations of the escalation"" and ""be with our soldiers in the tough times in Donbas"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the conflict in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. She urged Russia to ""de-escalate tensions"" by pulling troops back, while Mr Putin accused Ukraine of inflaming the situation in the east. What else did the Kremlin official say? In Moscow, Mr Kozak likened the current situation of the separatists to Srebrenica, the town in Bosnia-Herzegovina where 8,000 Muslim men were killed by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. ""If, as our president says, there is a Srebrenica there, we shall probably have to come to their defence,"" Mr Kozak said. President Putin first suggested in 2019 that Russian-speaking residents might suffer a Srebrenica-like massacre if Ukraine regained full control of Donbas without guarantees. He has always made it clear the Russian state reserves the right to defend ethnic Russians abroad, and in 2019 signed a law making it easier for people in separatist areas to obtain Russian passports. There is no sign that Ukraine is preparing any such Bosnian Serb-style ""ethnic cleansing"" campaign. media captionCarl Bildt: ""This could lead to open conflict again"" Mr Kozak suggested the rebels could hold their own for now against Ukrainian forces, as they consisted of ""battle-hardened units"". What's the background to all this? The roots of the conflict go back to March 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych had fled the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in February, after massive street demonstrations and clashes. Russia's military intervention sparked a major rift with Western nations, prompting the European Union and the US to impose sanctions on Russia. A month later, Russian-backed rebels in the mainly Russian-speaking Donbas seized much of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Western governments and Nato accused Russia of sending regular troops over the border into Ukraine, but Russia maintains any Russian fighters there are ""volunteers"". Ukraine's President Zelensky came to power promising to bring about peace, and a ceasefire was signed last July. Both sides have since accused each other of violating it. The conflict is estimated to have killed 14,000 people. Related Topics ",2021-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,2021-04-09 19:24:18.569087+00:00,EXTM
