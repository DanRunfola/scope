Clad in sleek red gowns and wreathed in smiles, the models lined up in Bangui stadium for the capital's first Miss Central African Republic beauty pageant for three years - all thanks to Russia.

In a country mired in conflict and poverty, the flash of cameras capturing the moment a young woman was crowned the nation's glamour queen was a moment to savour.

But for Western observers, the contest also marked the latest subtle shift in a regional power dynamic.

In their eyes, Russia's funding of the event signalled a bid to boost its clout in the former French colony, deploying people-pleasing ""soft power"" as well as military aid.

In the capital's crumbling 20,000-seat main stadium at the weekend, about 100 people - mostly state officials and the families of contestants - watched the women parade in high heels alongside Russian flags adorning the venue's walls.

Lobaye Invest, a diamond mining firm reputedly close to the Kremlin, featured prominently on the billboards of event sponsors.","PARM",NULL,"79"
"244","Since then, Moscow has supplied weapons, military officers, 170 military ""trainers"" and a security advisor to work with President Faustin-Archange Touadera - a significant deployment to a country historically linked to France and which already has EU and UN aid.

The military trainers sent by Russia are mercenaries with close ties to Russian mining companies and the numbers deployed could be significantly higher, according to Western sources.","PARM",NULL,"79"
