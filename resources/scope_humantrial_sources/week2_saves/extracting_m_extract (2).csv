Clad in sleek red gowns and wreathed in smiles, the models lined up in Bangui stadium for the capital's first Miss Central African Republic beauty pageant for three years - all thanks to Russia.

In a country mired in conflict and poverty, the flash of cameras capturing the moment a young woman was crowned the nation's glamour queen was a moment to savour.

But for Western observers, the contest also marked the latest subtle shift in a regional power dynamic.

In their eyes, Russia's funding of the event signalled a bid to boost its clout in the former French colony, deploying people-pleasing ""soft power"" as well as military aid.

In the capital's crumbling 20,000-seat main stadium at the weekend, about 100 people - mostly state officials and the families of contestants - watched the women parade in high heels alongside Russian flags adorning the venue's walls.

Lobaye Invest, a diamond mining firm reputedly close to the Kremlin, featured prominently on the billboards of event sponsors.","PARM",NULL,"79"
"244","Since then, Moscow has supplied weapons, military officers, 170 military ""trainers"" and a security advisor to work with President Faustin-Archange Touadera - a significant deployment to a country historically linked to France and which already has EU and UN aid.

The military trainers sent by Russia are mercenaries with close ties to Russian mining companies and the numbers deployed could be significantly higher, according to Western sources.","PARM",NULL,"79"
"245","Ms Parly was in Bangui for ceremonies in which France handed over 1,400 Kalashnikov assault rifles and three amphibious vehicles to CAR's poorly-equipped army.

The French-supplied weapons follow 1,700 Kalashnikovs provided by Russia in January.

Both shipments have been approved by a UN panel that issues exemptions to a global arms embargo against the CAR.","PARM",NULL,"79"
"246","Through simple goodwill or part of a broader initiative for prestige and influence, Russia this year also staged a ""Cup of Hope"" football tournament and organised a drawing and poetry competition for local children.

"247","Three Russian journalists killed in the Central African Republic this week were investigating a Russian private military company with links to the Kremlin, their editors said. Media reports said that the men may have been ambushed and killed Monday evening near the village of Sibut, about 185 miles (300km) north of the CAR’s capital, Bangui.

Earlier the men had been refused entry to a military base they believed run by Wagner because they lacked proper accreditation, Anastasia Gorshkova, deputy editor at the IMC, told the Russian television station TV Rain.","PARM",NULL,"90"

"251","From January to March, Russian officials met with at least three major rebel leaders in the country. Two of them —Michel Djotodia, a former president of CAR; and Noureddine Adam, who leads the Renaissance of the Central African Republic group — are currently subject to sanctions from the United States and U.N. respectively for their roles in the 2013 coup d’état and subsequent reign of terror that brought about the country’s current humanitarian crisis. Djotodia’s March meeting with the Russians reportedly concerned access to platinum and mercury deposits on his land.","PARM",NULL,"83"
"252","The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement indicating that Moscow intended to work with the government to secure mining concessions, but since Touadéra is unlikely to negotiate peace or retake the land outright, Russia may be attempting to acquire the resources it desires through other means.","EXTQ",NULL,"83"

"263","At the UN Security Council, Russia agrees to lift its veto on the delivery of French arms to the Bangui regime and even proposes to advocate for a temporary lifting of the arms embargo.
